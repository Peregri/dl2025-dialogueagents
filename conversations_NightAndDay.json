        "raw text": " I\n\n\nIt was a Sunday evening in October, and in common with many other young\nladies of her class, Katharine Hilbery was pouring out tea. Perhaps a\nfifth part of her mind was thus occupied, and the remaining parts leapt\nover the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning\nand this rather subdued moment, and played with the things one does\nvoluntarily and normally in the daylight. But although she was silent,\nshe was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to\nher, and inclined to let it take its way for the six hundredth time,\nperhaps, without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties. A\nsingle glance was enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the\ngifts which make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people\nsuccessful, that she scarcely needed any help from her daughter,\nprovided that the tiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was\ndischarged for her.\n\nConsidering that the little party had been seated round the tea-table\nfor less than twenty minutes, the animation observable on their faces,\nand the amount of sound they were producing collectively, were very\ncreditable to the hostess. It suddenly came into Katharine s mind that\nif some one opened the door at this moment he would think that they\nwere enjoying themselves; he would think, \"What an extremely nice house\nto come into!\" and instinctively she laughed, and said something to\nincrease the noise, for the credit of the house presumably, since she\nherself had not been feeling exhilarated. At the very same moment,\nrather to her amusement, the door was flung open, and a young man\nentered the room. Katharine, as she shook hands with him, asked him, in\nher own mind, \"Now, do you think we re enjoying ourselves\nenormously?\"... \"Mr. Denham, mother,\" she said aloud, for she saw that\nher mother had forgotten his name.\n\nThat fact was perceptible to Mr. Denham also, and increased the\nawkwardness which inevitably attends the entrance of a stranger into a\nroom full of people much at their ease, and all launched upon\nsentences. At the same time, it seemed to Mr. Denham as if a thousand\nsoftly padded doors had closed between him and the street outside. A\nfine mist, the etherealized essence of the fog, hung visibly in the\nwide and rather empty space of the drawing-room, all silver where the\ncandles were grouped on the tea-table, and ruddy again in the\nfirelight. With the omnibuses and cabs still running in his head, and\nhis body still tingling with his quick walk along the streets and in\nand out of traffic and foot-passengers, this drawing-room seemed very\nremote and still; and the faces of the elderly people were mellowed, at\nsome distance from each other, and had a bloom on them owing to the\nfact that the air in the drawing-room was thickened by blue grains of\nmist. Mr. Denham had come in as Mr. Fortescue, the eminent novelist,\nreached the middle of a very long sentence. He kept this suspended\nwhile the newcomer sat down, and Mrs. Hilbery deftly joined the severed\nparts by leaning towards him and remarking:\n\n\"Now, what would you do if you were married to an engineer, and had to\nlive in Manchester, Mr. Denham?\"\n\n\"Surely she could learn Persian,\" broke in a thin, elderly gentleman.\n\"Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with\nwhom she could read Persian?\"\n\n\"A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester,\"\nKatharine explained. Mr. Denham muttered something, which was indeed\nall that was required of him, and the novelist went on where he had\nleft off. Privately, Mr. Denham cursed himself very sharply for having\nexchanged the freedom of the street for this sophisticated\ndrawing-room, where, among other disagreeables, he certainly would not\nappear at his best. He glanced round him, and saw that, save for\nKatharine, they were all over forty, the only consolation being that\nMr. Fortescue was a considerable celebrity, so that to-morrow one might\nbe glad to have met him.\n\n\"Have you ever been to Manchester?\" he asked Katharine.\n\n\"Never,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why do you object to it, then?\"\n\nKatharine stirred her tea, and seemed to speculate, so Denham thought,\nupon the duty of filling somebody else s cup, but she was really\nwondering how she was going to keep this strange young man in harmony\nwith the rest. She observed that he was compressing his teacup, so that\nthere was danger lest the thin china might cave inwards. She could see\nthat he was nervous; one would expect a bony young man with his face\nslightly reddened by the wind, and his hair not altogether smooth, to\nbe nervous in such a party. Further, he probably disliked this kind of\nthing, and had come out of curiosity, or because her father had invited\nhim anyhow, he would not be easily combined with the rest.\n\n\"I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester,\" she\nreplied at random. Mr. Fortescue had been observing her for a moment or\ntwo, as novelists are inclined to observe, and at this remark he\nsmiled, and made it the text for a little further speculation.\n\n\"In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration, Katharine decidedly\nhits the mark,\" he said, and lying back in his chair, with his opaque\ncontemplative eyes fixed on the ceiling, and the tips of his fingers\npressed together, he depicted, first the horrors of the streets of\nManchester, and then the bare, immense moors on the outskirts of the\ntown, and then the scrubby little house in which the girl would live,\nand then the professors and the miserable young students devoted to the\nmore strenuous works of our younger dramatists, who would visit her,\nand how her appearance would change by degrees, and how she would fly\nto London, and how Katharine would have to lead her about, as one leads\nan eager dog on a chain, past rows of clamorous butchers  shops, poor\ndear creature.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Fortescue,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, as he finished, \"I had\njust written to say how I envied her! I was thinking of the big gardens\nand the dear old ladies in mittens, who read nothing but the\n\"Spectator,\" and snuff the candles. Have they _all_ disappeared? I told\nher she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets\nthat depress one so.\"\n\n\"There is the University,\" said the thin gentleman, who had previously\ninsisted upon the existence of people knowing Persian.\n\n\"I know there are moors there, because I read about them in a book the\nother day,\" said Katharine.\n\n\"I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family,\" Mr. Hilbery\nremarked. He was an elderly man, with a pair of oval, hazel eyes which\nwere rather bright for his time of life, and relieved the heaviness of\nhis face. He played constantly with a little green stone attached to\nhis watch-chain, thus displaying long and very sensitive fingers, and\nhad a habit of moving his head hither and thither very quickly without\naltering the position of his large and rather corpulent body, so that\nhe seemed to be providing himself incessantly with food for amusement\nand reflection with the least possible expenditure of energy. One might\nsuppose that he had passed the time of life when his ambitions were\npersonal, or that he had gratified them as far as he was likely to do,\nand now employed his considerable acuteness rather to observe and\nreflect than to attain any result.\n\nKatharine, so Denham decided, while Mr. Fortescue built up another\nrounded structure of words, had a likeness to each of her parents, but\nthese elements were rather oddly blended. She had the quick, impulsive\nmovements of her mother, the lips parting often to speak, and closing\nagain; and the dark oval eyes of her father brimming with light upon a\nbasis of sadness, or, since she was too young to have acquired a\nsorrowful point of view, one might say that the basis was not sadness\nso much as a spirit given to contemplation and self-control. Judging by\nher hair, her coloring, and the shape of her features, she was\nstriking, if not actually beautiful. Decision and composure stamped\nher, a combination of qualities that produced a very marked character,\nand one that was not calculated to put a young man, who scarcely knew\nher, at his ease. For the rest, she was tall; her dress was of some\nquiet color, with old yellow-tinted lace for ornament, to which the\nspark of an ancient jewel gave its one red gleam. Denham noticed that,\nalthough silent, she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer\nimmediately her mother appealed to her for help, and yet it was obvious\nto him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind. It\nstruck him that her position at the tea-table, among all these elderly\npeople, was not without its difficulties, and he checked his\ninclination to find her, or her attitude, generally antipathetic to\nhim. The talk had passed over Manchester, after dealing with it very\ngenerously.\n\n\"Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada, Katharine?\"\nher mother demanded.\n\n\"Trafalgar, mother.\"\n\n\"Trafalgar, of course! How stupid of me! Another cup of tea, with a\nthin slice of lemon in it, and then, dear Mr. Fortescue, please explain\nmy absurd little puzzle. One can t help believing gentlemen with Roman\nnoses, even if one meets them in omnibuses.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery here interposed so far as Denham was concerned, and talked\na great deal of sense about the solicitors  profession, and the changes\nwhich he had seen in his lifetime. Indeed, Denham properly fell to his\nlot, owing to the fact that an article by Denham upon some legal\nmatter, published by Mr. Hilbery in his Review, had brought them\nacquainted. But when a moment later Mrs. Sutton Bailey was announced,\nhe turned to her, and Mr. Denham found himself sitting silent,\nrejecting possible things to say, beside Katharine, who was silent too.\nBeing much about the same age and both under thirty, they were\nprohibited from the use of a great many convenient phrases which launch\nconversation into smooth waters. They were further silenced by\nKatharine s rather malicious determination not to help this young man,\nin whose upright and resolute bearing she detected something hostile to\nher surroundings, by any of the usual feminine amenities. They\ntherefore sat silent, Denham controlling his desire to say something\nabrupt and explosive, which should shock her into life. But Mrs.\nHilbery was immediately sensitive to any silence in the drawing-room,\nas of a dumb note in a sonorous scale, and leaning across the table she\nobserved, in the curiously tentative detached manner which always gave\nher phrases the likeness of butterflies flaunting from one sunny spot\nto another, \"D you know, Mr. Denham, you remind me so much of dear Mr.\nRuskin.... Is it his tie, Katharine, or his hair, or the way he sits in\nhis chair? Do tell me, Mr. Denham, are you an admirer of Ruskin? Some\none, the other day, said to me,  Oh, no, we don t read Ruskin, Mrs.\nHilbery.  What _do_ you read, I wonder? for you can t spend all your\ntime going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the\nearth.\"\n\nShe looked benevolently at Denham, who said nothing articulate, and\nthen at Katharine, who smiled but said nothing either, upon which Mrs.\nHilbery seemed possessed by a brilliant idea, and exclaimed:\n\n\"I m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things, Katharine. I m sure\nhe s not like that dreadful young man, Mr. Ponting, who told me that he\nconsidered it our duty to live exclusively in the present. After all,\nwhat IS the present? Half of it s the past, and the better half, too, I\nshould say,\" she added, turning to Mr. Fortescue.\n\nDenham rose, half meaning to go, and thinking that he had seen all that\nthere was to see, but Katharine rose at the same moment, and saying,\n\"Perhaps you would like to see the pictures,\" led the way across the\ndrawing-room to a smaller room opening out of it.\n\nThe smaller room was something like a chapel in a cathedral, or a\ngrotto in a cave, for the booming sound of the traffic in the distance\nsuggested the soft surge of waters, and the oval mirrors, with their\nsilver surface, were like deep pools trembling beneath starlight. But\nthe comparison to a religious temple of some kind was the more apt of\nthe two, for the little room was crowded with relics.\n\nAs Katharine touched different spots, lights sprang here and there, and\nrevealed a square mass of red-and-gold books, and then a long skirt in\nblue-and-white paint lustrous behind glass, and then a mahogany\nwriting-table, with its orderly equipment, and, finally, a picture\nabove the table, to which special illumination was accorded. When\nKatharine had touched these last lights, she stood back, as much as to\nsay, \"There!\" Denham found himself looked down upon by the eyes of the\ngreat poet, Richard Alardyce, and suffered a little shock which would\nhave led him, had he been wearing a hat, to remove it. The eyes looked\nat him out of the mellow pinks and yellows of the paint with divine\nfriendliness, which embraced him, and passed on to contemplate the\nentire world. The paint had so faded that very little but the beautiful\nlarge eyes were left, dark in the surrounding dimness.\n\nKatharine waited as though for him to receive a full impression, and\nthen she said:\n\n\"This is his writing-table. He used this pen,\" and she lifted a quill\npen and laid it down again. The writing-table was splashed with old\nink, and the pen disheveled in service. There lay the gigantic\ngold-rimmed spectacles, ready to his hand, and beneath the table was a\npair of large, worn slippers, one of which Katharine picked up,\nremarking:\n\n\"I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any\none is nowadays. This,\" she went on, as if she knew what she had to say\nby heart, \"is the original manuscript of the  Ode to Winter.  The early\npoems are far less corrected than the later. Would you like to look at\nit?\"\n\nWhile Mr. Denham examined the manuscript, she glanced up at her\ngrandfather, and, for the thousandth time, fell into a pleasant dreamy\nstate in which she seemed to be the companion of those giant men, of\ntheir own lineage, at any rate, and the insignificant present moment\nwas put to shame. That magnificent ghostly head on the canvas, surely,\nnever beheld all the trivialities of a Sunday afternoon, and it did not\nseem to matter what she and this young man said to each other, for they\nwere only small people.\n\n\"This is a copy of the first edition of the poems,\" she continued,\nwithout considering the fact that Mr. Denham was still occupied with\nthe manuscript, \"which contains several poems that have not been\nreprinted, as well as corrections.\" She paused for a minute, and then\nwent on, as if these spaces had all been calculated.\n\n\"That lady in blue is my great-grandmother, by Millington. Here is my\nuncle s walking-stick he was Sir Richard Warburton, you know, and rode\nwith Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow. And then, let me see oh, that s\nthe original Alardyce, 1697, the founder of the family fortunes, with\nhis wife. Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their\ncrest and initials. We think it must have been given them to celebrate\ntheir silver wedding-day.\"\n\nHere she stopped for a moment, wondering why it was that Mr. Denham\nsaid nothing. Her feeling that he was antagonistic to her, which had\nlapsed while she thought of her family possessions, returned so keenly\nthat she stopped in the middle of her catalog and looked at him. Her\nmother, wishing to connect him reputably with the great dead, had\ncompared him with Mr. Ruskin; and the comparison was in Katharine s\nmind, and led her to be more critical of the young man than was fair,\nfor a young man paying a call in a tail-coat is in a different element\naltogether from a head seized at its climax of expressiveness, gazing\nimmutably from behind a sheet of glass, which was all that remained to\nher of Mr. Ruskin. He had a singular face a face built for swiftness\nand decision rather than for massive contemplation; the forehead broad,\nthe nose long and formidable, the lips clean-shaven and at once dogged\nand sensitive, the cheeks lean, with a deeply running tide of red blood\nin them. His eyes, expressive now of the usual masculine impersonality\nand authority, might reveal more subtle emotions under favorable\ncircumstances, for they were large, and of a clear, brown color; they\nseemed unexpectedly to hesitate and speculate; but Katharine only\nlooked at him to wonder whether his face would not have come nearer the\nstandard of her dead heroes if it had been adorned with side-whiskers.\nIn his spare build and thin, though healthy, cheeks, she saw tokens of\nan angular and acrid soul. His voice, she noticed, had a slight\nvibrating or creaking sound in it, as he laid down the manuscript and\nsaid:\n\n\"You must be very proud of your family, Miss Hilbery.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" Katharine answered, and she added, \"Do you think there s\nanything wrong in that?\"\n\n\"Wrong? How should it be wrong? It must be a bore, though, showing your\nthings to visitors,\" he added reflectively.\n\n\"Not if the visitors like them.\"\n\n\"Isn t it difficult to live up to your ancestors?\" he proceeded.\n\n\"I dare say I shouldn t try to write poetry,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"No. And that s what I should hate. I couldn t bear my grandfather to\ncut me out. And, after all,\" Denham went on, glancing round him\nsatirically, as Katharine thought, \"it s not your grandfather only.\nYou re cut out all the way round. I suppose you come of one of the most\ndistinguished families in England. There are the Warburtons and the\nMannings and you re related to the Otways, aren t you? I read it all in\nsome magazine,\" he added.\n\n\"The Otways are my cousins,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denham, in a final tone of voice, as if his argument were\nproved.\n\n\"Well,\" said Katharine, \"I don t see that you ve proved anything.\"\n\nDenham smiled, in a peculiarly provoking way. He was amused and\ngratified to find that he had the power to annoy his oblivious,\nsupercilious hostess, if he could not impress her; though he would have\npreferred to impress her.\n\nHe sat silent, holding the precious little book of poems unopened in\nhis hands, and Katharine watched him, the melancholy or contemplative\nexpression deepening in her eyes as her annoyance faded. She appeared\nto be considering many things. She had forgotten her duties.\n\n\"Well,\" said Denham again, suddenly opening the little book of poems,\nas though he had said all that he meant to say or could, with\npropriety, say. He turned over the pages with great decision, as if he\nwere judging the book in its entirety, the printing and paper and\nbinding, as well as the poetry, and then, having satisfied himself of\nits good or bad quality, he placed it on the writing-table, and\nexamined the malacca cane with the gold knob which had belonged to the\nsoldier.\n\n\"But aren t you proud of your family?\" Katharine demanded.\n\n\"No,\" said Denham. \"We ve never done anything to be proud of unless you\ncount paying one s bills a matter for pride.\"\n\n\"That sounds rather dull,\" Katharine remarked.\n\n\"You would think us horribly dull,\" Denham agreed.\n\n\"Yes, I might find you dull, but I don t think I should find you\nridiculous,\" Katharine added, as if Denham had actually brought that\ncharge against her family.\n\n\"No because we re not in the least ridiculous. We re a respectable\nmiddle-class family, living at Highgate.\"\n\n\"We don t live at Highgate, but we re middle class too, I suppose.\"\n\nDenham merely smiled, and replacing the malacca cane on the rack, he\ndrew a sword from its ornamental sheath.\n\n\"That belonged to Clive, so we say,\" said Katharine, taking up her\nduties as hostess again automatically.\n\n\"Is it a lie?\" Denham inquired.\n\n\"It s a family tradition. I don t know that we can prove it.\"\n\n\"You see, we don t have traditions in our family,\" said Denham.\n\n\"You sound very dull,\" Katharine remarked, for the second time.\n\n\"Merely middle class,\" Denham replied.\n\n\"You pay your bills, and you speak the truth. I don t see why you\nshould despise us.\"\n\nMr. Denham carefully sheathed the sword which the Hilberys said\nbelonged to Clive.\n\n\"I shouldn t like to be you; that s all I said,\" he replied, as if he\nwere saying what he thought as accurately as he could.\n\n\"No, but one never would like to be any one else.\"\n\n\"I should. I should like to be lots of other people.\"\n\n\"Then why not us?\" Katharine asked.\n\nDenham looked at her as she sat in her grandfather s arm-chair, drawing\nher great-uncle s malacca cane smoothly through her fingers, while her\nbackground was made up equally of lustrous blue-and-white paint, and\ncrimson books with gilt lines on them. The vitality and composure of\nher attitude, as of a bright-plumed bird poised easily before further\nflights, roused him to show her the limitations of her lot. So soon, so\neasily, would he be forgotten.\n\n\"You ll never know anything at first hand,\" he began, almost savagely.\n\"It s all been done for you. You ll never know the pleasure of buying\nthings after saving up for them, or reading books for the first time,\nor making discoveries.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Katharine observed, as he paused, suddenly doubtful, when he\nheard his voice proclaiming aloud these facts, whether there was any\ntruth in them.\n\n\"Of course, I don t know how you spend your time,\" he continued, a\nlittle stiffly, \"but I suppose you have to show people round. You are\nwriting a life of your grandfather, aren t you? And this kind of\nthing\" he nodded towards the other room, where they could hear bursts\nof cultivated laughter \"must take up a lot of time.\"\n\nShe looked at him expectantly, as if between them they were decorating\na small figure of herself, and she saw him hesitating in the\ndisposition of some bow or sash.\n\n\"You ve got it very nearly right,\" she said, \"but I only help my\nmother. I don t write myself.\"\n\n\"Do you do anything yourself?\" he demanded.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"I don t leave the house at ten and come\nback at six.\"\n\n\"I don t mean that.\"\n\nMr. Denham had recovered his self-control; he spoke with a quietness\nwhich made Katharine rather anxious that he should explain himself, but\nat the same time she wished to annoy him, to waft him away from her on\nsome light current of ridicule or satire, as she was wont to do with\nthese intermittent young men of her father s.\n\n\"Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays,\" she remarked. \"You\nsee\" she tapped the volume of her grandfather s poems \"we don t even\nprint as well as they did, and as for poets or painters or\nnovelists there are none; so, at any rate, I m not singular.\"\n\n\"No, we haven t any great men,\" Denham replied. \"I m very glad that we\nhaven t. I hate great men. The worship of greatness in the nineteenth\ncentury seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation.\"\n\nKatharine opened her lips and drew in her breath, as if to reply with\nequal vigor, when the shutting of a door in the next room withdrew her\nattention, and they both became conscious that the voices, which had\nbeen rising and falling round the tea-table, had fallen silent; the\nlight, even, seemed to have sunk lower. A moment later Mrs. Hilbery\nappeared in the doorway of the ante-room. She stood looking at them\nwith a smile of expectancy on her face, as if a scene from the drama of\nthe younger generation were being played for her benefit. She was a\nremarkable-looking woman, well advanced in the sixties, but owing to\nthe lightness of her frame and the brightness of her eyes she seemed to\nhave been wafted over the surface of the years without taking much harm\nin the passage. Her face was shrunken and aquiline, but any hint of\nsharpness was dispelled by the large blue eyes, at once sagacious and\ninnocent, which seemed to regard the world with an enormous desire that\nit should behave itself nobly, and an entire confidence that it could\ndo so, if it would only take the pains.\n\nCertain lines on the broad forehead and about the lips might be taken\nto suggest that she had known moments of some difficulty and perplexity\nin the course of her career, but these had not destroyed her\ntrustfulness, and she was clearly still prepared to give every one any\nnumber of fresh chances and the whole system the benefit of the doubt.\nShe wore a great resemblance to her father, and suggested, as he did,\nthe fresh airs and open spaces of a younger world.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"how do you like our things, Mr. Denham?\"\n\nMr. Denham rose, put his book down, opened his mouth, but said nothing,\nas Katharine observed, with some amusement.\n\nMrs. Hilbery handled the book he had laid down.\n\n\"There are some books that _live_,\" she mused. \"They are young with us,\nand they grow old with us. Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Denham? But what\nan absurd question to ask! The truth is, dear Mr. Fortescue has almost\ntired me out. He is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so\nprofound that, after half an hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out\nall the lights. But perhaps he d be more wonderful than ever in the\ndark. What d you think, Katharine? Shall we give a little party in\ncomplete darkness? There d have to be bright rooms for the bores....\"\n\nHere Mr. Denham held out his hand.\n\n\"But we ve any number of things to show you!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed,\ntaking no notice of it. \"Books, pictures, china, manuscripts, and the\nvery chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of Darnley s\nmurder. I must lie down for a little, and Katharine must change her\ndress (though she s wearing a very pretty one), but if you don t mind\nbeing left alone, supper will be at eight. I dare say you ll write a\npoem of your own while you re waiting. Ah, how I love the firelight!\nDoesn t our room look charming?\"\n\nShe stepped back and bade them contemplate the empty drawing-room, with\nits rich, irregular lights, as the flames leapt and wavered.\n\n\"Dear things!\" she exclaimed. \"Dear chairs and tables! How like old\nfriends they are faithful, silent friends. Which reminds me, Katharine,\nlittle Mr. Anning is coming to-night, and Tite Street, and Cadogan\nSquare.... Do remember to get that drawing of your great-uncle glazed.\nAunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here, and I know how it\nwould hurt me to see _my_ father in a broken glass.\"\n\nIt was like tearing through a maze of diamond-glittering spiders  webs\nto say good-bye and escape, for at each movement Mrs. Hilbery\nremembered something further about the villainies of picture-framers or\nthe delights of poetry, and at one time it seemed to the young man that\nhe would be hypnotized into doing what she pretended to want him to do,\nfor he could not suppose that she attached any value whatever to his\npresence. Katharine, however, made an opportunity for him to leave, and\nfor that he was grateful to her, as one young person is grateful for\nthe understanding of another.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " II\n\n\nThe young man shut the door with a sharper slam than any visitor had\nused that afternoon, and walked up the street at a great pace, cutting\nthe air with his walking-stick. He was glad to find himself outside\nthat drawing-room, breathing raw fog, and in contact with unpolished\npeople who only wanted their share of the pavement allowed them. He\nthought that if he had had Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Hilbery out here he\nwould have made them, somehow, feel his superiority, for he was chafed\nby the memory of halting awkward sentences which had failed to give\neven the young woman with the sad, but inwardly ironical eyes a hint of\nhis force. He tried to recall the actual words of his little outburst,\nand unconsciously supplemented them by so many words of greater\nexpressiveness that the irritation of his failure was somewhat\nassuaged. Sudden stabs of the unmitigated truth assailed him now and\nthen, for he was not inclined by nature to take a rosy view of his\nconduct, but what with the beat of his foot upon the pavement, and the\nglimpse which half-drawn curtains offered him of kitchens,\ndining-rooms, and drawing-rooms, illustrating with mute power different\nscenes from different lives, his own experience lost its sharpness.\n\nHis own experience underwent a curious change. His speed slackened, his\nhead sank a little towards his breast, and the lamplight shone now and\nagain upon a face grown strangely tranquil. His thought was so\nabsorbing that when it became necessary to verify the name of a street,\nhe looked at it for a time before he read it; when he came to a\ncrossing, he seemed to have to reassure himself by two or three taps,\nsuch as a blind man gives, upon the curb; and, reaching the Underground\nstation, he blinked in the bright circle of light, glanced at his\nwatch, decided that he might still indulge himself in darkness, and\nwalked straight on.\n\nAnd yet the thought was the thought with which he had started. He was\nstill thinking about the people in the house which he had left; but\ninstead of remembering, with whatever accuracy he could, their looks\nand sayings, he had consciously taken leave of the literal truth. A\nturn of the street, a firelit room, something monumental in the\nprocession of the lamp-posts, who shall say what accident of light or\nshape had suddenly changed the prospect within his mind, and led him to\nmurmur aloud:\n\n\"She ll do.... Yes, Katharine Hilbery ll do.... I ll take Katharine\nHilbery.\"\n\nAs soon as he had said this, his pace slackened, his head fell, his\neyes became fixed. The desire to justify himself, which had been so\nurgent, ceased to torment him, and, as if released from constraint, so\nthat they worked without friction or bidding, his faculties leapt\nforward and fixed, as a matter of course, upon the form of Katharine\nHilbery. It was marvellous how much they found to feed upon,\nconsidering the destructive nature of Denham s criticism in her\npresence. The charm, which he had tried to disown, when under the\neffect of it, the beauty, the character, the aloofness, which he had\nbeen determined not to feel, now possessed him wholly; and when, as\nhappened by the nature of things, he had exhausted his memory, he went\non with his imagination. He was conscious of what he was about, for in\nthus dwelling upon Miss Hilbery s qualities, he showed a kind of\nmethod, as if he required this vision of her for a particular purpose.\nHe increased her height, he darkened her hair; but physically there was\nnot much to change in her. His most daring liberty was taken with her\nmind, which, for reasons of his own, he desired to be exalted and\ninfallible, and of such independence that it was only in the case of\nRalph Denham that it swerved from its high, swift flight, but where he\nwas concerned, though fastidious at first, she finally swooped from her\neminence to crown him with her approval. These delicious details,\nhowever, were to be worked out in all their ramifications at his\nleisure; the main point was that Katharine Hilbery would do; she would\ndo for weeks, perhaps for months. In taking her he had provided himself\nwith something the lack of which had left a bare place in his mind for\na considerable time. He gave a sigh of satisfaction; his consciousness\nof his actual position somewhere in the neighborhood of Knightsbridge\nreturned to him, and he was soon speeding in the train towards\nHighgate.\n\nAlthough thus supported by the knowledge of his new possession of\nconsiderable value, he was not proof against the familiar thoughts\nwhich the suburban streets and the damp shrubs growing in front gardens\nand the absurd names painted in white upon the gates of those gardens\nsuggested to him. His walk was uphill, and his mind dwelt gloomily upon\nthe house which he approached, where he would find six or seven\nbrothers and sisters, a widowed mother, and, probably, some aunt or\nuncle sitting down to an unpleasant meal under a very bright light.\nShould he put in force the threat which, two weeks ago, some such\ngathering had wrung from him the terrible threat that if visitors came\non Sunday he should dine alone in his room? A glance in the direction\nof Miss Hilbery determined him to make his stand this very night, and\naccordingly, having let himself in, having verified the presence of\nUncle Joseph by means of a bowler hat and a very large umbrella, he\ngave his orders to the maid, and went upstairs to his room.\n\nHe went up a great many flights of stairs, and he noticed, as he had\nvery seldom noticed, how the carpet became steadily shabbier, until it\nceased altogether, how the walls were discolored, sometimes by cascades\nof damp, and sometimes by the outlines of picture-frames since removed,\nhow the paper flapped loose at the corners, and a great flake of\nplaster had fallen from the ceiling. The room itself was a cheerless\none to return to at this inauspicious hour. A flattened sofa would,\nlater in the evening, become a bed; one of the tables concealed a\nwashing apparatus; his clothes and boots were disagreeably mixed with\nbooks which bore the gilt of college arms; and, for decoration, there\nhung upon the wall photographs of bridges and cathedrals and large,\nunprepossessing groups of insufficiently clothed young men, sitting in\nrows one above another upon stone steps. There was a look of meanness\nand shabbiness in the furniture and curtains, and nowhere any sign of\nluxury or even of a cultivated taste, unless the cheap classics in the\nbook-case were a sign of an effort in that direction. The only object\nthat threw any light upon the character of the room s owner was a large\nperch, placed in the window to catch the air and sun, upon which a tame\nand, apparently, decrepit rook hopped dryly from side to side. The\nbird, encouraged by a scratch behind the ear, settled upon Denham s\nshoulder. He lit his gas-fire and settled down in gloomy patience to\nawait his dinner. After sitting thus for some minutes a small girl\npopped her head in to say,\n\n\"Mother says, aren t you coming down, Ralph? Uncle Joseph \"\n\n\"They re to bring my dinner up here,\" said Ralph, peremptorily;\nwhereupon she vanished, leaving the door ajar in her haste to be gone.\nAfter Denham had waited some minutes, in the course of which neither he\nnor the rook took their eyes off the fire, he muttered a curse, ran\ndownstairs, intercepted the parlor-maid, and cut himself a slice of\nbread and cold meat. As he did so, the dining-room door sprang open, a\nvoice exclaimed \"Ralph!\" but Ralph paid no attention to the voice, and\nmade off upstairs with his plate. He set it down in a chair opposite\nhim, and ate with a ferocity that was due partly to anger and partly to\nhunger. His mother, then, was determined not to respect his wishes; he\nwas a person of no importance in his own family; he was sent for and\ntreated as a child. He reflected, with a growing sense of injury, that\nalmost every one of his actions since opening the door of his room had\nbeen won from the grasp of the family system. By rights, he should have\nbeen sitting downstairs in the drawing-room describing his afternoon s\nadventures, or listening to the afternoon s adventures of other people;\nthe room itself, the gas-fire, the arm-chair all had been fought for;\nthe wretched bird, with half its feathers out and one leg lamed by a\ncat, had been rescued under protest; but what his family most resented,\nhe reflected, was his wish for privacy. To dine alone, or to sit alone\nafter dinner, was flat rebellion, to be fought with every weapon of\nunderhand stealth or of open appeal. Which did he dislike\nmost deception or tears? But, at any rate, they could not rob him of\nhis thoughts; they could not make him say where he had been or whom he\nhad seen. That was his own affair; that, indeed, was a step entirely in\nthe right direction, and, lighting his pipe, and cutting up the remains\nof his meal for the benefit of the rook, Ralph calmed his rather\nexcessive irritation and settled down to think over his prospects.\n\nThis particular afternoon was a step in the right direction, because it\nwas part of his plan to get to know people beyond the family circuit,\njust as it was part of his plan to learn German this autumn, and to\nreview legal books for Mr. Hilbery s \"Critical Review.\" He had always\nmade plans since he was a small boy; for poverty, and the fact that he\nwas the eldest son of a large family, had given him the habit of\nthinking of spring and summer, autumn and winter, as so many stages in\na prolonged campaign. Although he was still under thirty, this\nforecasting habit had marked two semicircular lines above his eyebrows,\nwhich threatened, at this moment, to crease into their wonted shapes.\nBut instead of settling down to think, he rose, took a small piece of\ncardboard marked in large letters with the word OUT, and hung it upon\nthe handle of his door. This done, he sharpened a pencil, lit a\nreading-lamp and opened his book. But still he hesitated to take his\nseat. He scratched the rook, he walked to the window; he parted the\ncurtains, and looked down upon the city which lay, hazily luminous,\nbeneath him. He looked across the vapors in the direction of Chelsea;\nlooked fixedly for a moment, and then returned to his chair. But the\nwhole thickness of some learned counsel s treatise upon Torts did not\nscreen him satisfactorily. Through the pages he saw a drawing-room,\nvery empty and spacious; he heard low voices, he saw women s figures,\nhe could even smell the scent of the cedar log which flamed in the\ngrate. His mind relaxed its tension, and seemed to be giving out now\nwhat it had taken in unconsciously at the time. He could remember Mr.\nFortescue s exact words, and the rolling emphasis with which he\ndelivered them, and he began to repeat what Mr. Fortescue had said, in\nMr. Fortescue s own manner, about Manchester. His mind then began to\nwander about the house, and he wondered whether there were other rooms\nlike the drawing-room, and he thought, inconsequently, how beautiful\nthe bathroom must be, and how leisurely it was the life of these\nwell-kept people, who were, no doubt, still sitting in the same room,\nonly they had changed their clothes, and little Mr. Anning was there,\nand the aunt who would mind if the glass of her father s picture was\nbroken. Miss Hilbery had changed her dress (\"although she s wearing\nsuch a pretty one,\" he heard her mother say), and she was talking to\nMr. Anning, who was well over forty, and bald into the bargain, about\nbooks. How peaceful and spacious it was; and the peace possessed him so\ncompletely that his muscles slackened, his book drooped from his hand,\nand he forgot that the hour of work was wasting minute by minute.\n\nHe was roused by a creak upon the stair. With a guilty start he\ncomposed himself, frowned and looked intently at the fifty-sixth page\nof his volume. A step paused outside his door, and he knew that the\nperson, whoever it might be, was considering the placard, and debating\nwhether to honor its decree or not. Certainly, policy advised him to\nsit still in autocratic silence, for no custom can take root in a\nfamily unless every breach of it is punished severely for the first six\nmonths or so. But Ralph was conscious of a distinct wish to be\ninterrupted, and his disappointment was perceptible when he heard the\ncreaking sound rather farther down the stairs, as if his visitor had\ndecided to withdraw. He rose, opened the door with unnecessary\nabruptness, and waited on the landing. The person stopped\nsimultaneously half a flight downstairs.\n\n\"Ralph?\" said a voice, inquiringly.\n\n\"Joan?\"\n\n\"I was coming up, but I saw your notice.\"\n\n\"Well, come along in, then.\" He concealed his desire beneath a tone as\ngrudging as he could make it.\n\nJoan came in, but she was careful to show, by standing upright with one\nhand upon the mantelpiece, that she was only there for a definite\npurpose, which discharged, she would go.\n\nShe was older than Ralph by some three or four years. Her face was\nround but worn, and expressed that tolerant but anxious good humor\nwhich is the special attribute of elder sisters in large families. Her\npleasant brown eyes resembled Ralph s, save in expression, for whereas\nhe seemed to look straightly and keenly at one object, she appeared to\nbe in the habit of considering everything from many different points of\nview. This made her appear his elder by more years than existed in fact\nbetween them. Her gaze rested for a moment or two upon the rook. She\nthen said, without any preface:\n\n\"It s about Charles and Uncle John s offer.... Mother s been talking to\nme. She says she can t afford to pay for him after this term. She says\nshe ll have to ask for an overdraft as it is.\"\n\n\"That s simply not true,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"No. I thought not. But she won t believe me when I say it.\"\n\nRalph, as if he could foresee the length of this familiar argument,\ndrew up a chair for his sister and sat down himself.\n\n\"I m not interrupting?\" she inquired.\n\nRalph shook his head, and for a time they sat silent. The lines curved\nthemselves in semicircles above their eyes.\n\n\"She doesn t understand that one s got to take risks,\" he observed,\nfinally.\n\n\"I believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was the\nsort of boy to profit by it.\"\n\n\"He s got brains, hasn t he?\" said Ralph. His tone had taken on that\nshade of pugnacity which suggested to his sister that some personal\ngrievance drove him to take the line he did. She wondered what it might\nbe, but at once recalled her mind, and assented.\n\n\"In some ways he s fearfully backward, though, compared with what you\nwere at his age. And he s difficult at home, too. He makes Molly slave\nfor him.\"\n\nRalph made a sound which belittled this particular argument. It was\nplain to Joan that she had struck one of her brother s perverse moods,\nand he was going to oppose whatever his mother said. He called her\n\"she,\" which was a proof of it. She sighed involuntarily, and the sigh\nannoyed Ralph, and he exclaimed with irritation:\n\n\"It s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen!\"\n\n\"Nobody _wants_ to stick him into an office,\" she said.\n\nShe, too, was becoming annoyed. She had spent the whole of the\nafternoon discussing wearisome details of education and expense with\nher mother, and she had come to her brother for help, encouraged,\nrather irrationally, to expect help by the fact that he had been out\nsomewhere, she didn t know and didn t mean to ask where, all the\nafternoon.\n\nRalph was fond of his sister, and her irritation made him think how\nunfair it was that all these burdens should be laid on her shoulders.\n\n\"The truth is,\" he observed gloomily, \"that I ought to have accepted\nUncle John s offer. I should have been making six hundred a year by\nthis time.\"\n\n\"I don t think that for a moment,\" Joan replied quickly, repenting of\nher annoyance. \"The question, to my mind, is, whether we couldn t cut\ndown our expenses in some way.\"\n\n\"A smaller house?\"\n\n\"Fewer servants, perhaps.\"\n\nNeither brother nor sister spoke with much conviction, and after\nreflecting for a moment what these proposed reforms in a strictly\neconomical household meant, Ralph announced very decidedly:\n\n\"It s out of the question.\"\n\nIt was out of the question that she should put any more household work\nupon herself. No, the hardship must fall on him, for he was determined\nthat his family should have as many chances of distinguishing\nthemselves as other families had as the Hilberys had, for example. He\nbelieved secretly and rather defiantly, for it was a fact not capable\nof proof, that there was something very remarkable about his family.\n\n\"If mother won t run risks \"\n\n\"You really can t expect her to sell out again.\"\n\n\"She ought to look upon it as an investment; but if she won t, we must\nfind some other way, that s all.\"\n\nA threat was contained in this sentence, and Joan knew, without asking,\nwhat the threat was. In the course of his professional life, which now\nextended over six or seven years, Ralph had saved, perhaps, three or\nfour hundred pounds. Considering the sacrifices he had made in order to\nput by this sum it always amazed Joan to find that he used it to gamble\nwith, buying shares and selling them again, increasing it sometimes,\nsometimes diminishing it, and always running the risk of losing every\npenny of it in a day s disaster. But although she wondered, she could\nnot help loving him the better for his odd combination of Spartan\nself-control and what appeared to her romantic and childish folly.\nRalph interested her more than any one else in the world, and she often\nbroke off in the middle of one of these economic discussions, in spite\nof their gravity, to consider some fresh aspect of his character.\n\n\"I think you d be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles,\" she\nobserved. \"Fond as I am of him, he doesn t seem to me exactly\nbrilliant.... Besides, why should you be sacrificed?\"\n\n\"My dear Joan,\" Ralph exclaimed, stretching himself out with a gesture\nof impatience, \"don t you see that we ve all got to be sacrificed?\nWhat s the use of denying it? What s the use of struggling against it?\nSo it always has been, so it always will be. We ve got no money and we\nnever shall have any money. We shall just turn round in the mill every\nday of our lives until we drop and die, worn out, as most people do,\nwhen one comes to think of it.\"\n\nJoan looked at him, opened her lips as if to speak, and closed them\nagain. Then she said, very tentatively:\n\n\"Aren t you happy, Ralph?\"\n\n\"No. Are you? Perhaps I m as happy as most people, though. God knows\nwhether I m happy or not. What is happiness?\"\n\nHe glanced with half a smile, in spite of his gloomy irritation, at his\nsister. She looked, as usual, as if she were weighing one thing with\nanother, and balancing them together before she made up her mind.\n\n\"Happiness,\" she remarked at length enigmatically, rather as if she\nwere sampling the word, and then she paused. She paused for a\nconsiderable space, as if she were considering happiness in all its\nbearings. \"Hilda was here to-day,\" she suddenly resumed, as if they had\nnever mentioned happiness. \"She brought Bobbie he s a fine boy now.\"\nRalph observed, with an amusement that had a tinge of irony in it, that\nshe was now going to sidle away quickly from this dangerous approach to\nintimacy on to topics of general and family interest. Nevertheless, he\nreflected, she was the only one of his family with whom he found it\npossible to discuss happiness, although he might very well have\ndiscussed happiness with Miss Hilbery at their first meeting. He looked\ncritically at Joan, and wished that she did not look so provincial or\nsuburban in her high green dress with the faded trimming, so patient,\nand almost resigned. He began to wish to tell her about the Hilberys in\norder to abuse them, for in the miniature battle which so often rages\nbetween two quickly following impressions of life, the life of the\nHilberys was getting the better of the life of the Denhams in his mind,\nand he wanted to assure himself that there was some quality in which\nJoan infinitely surpassed Miss Hilbery. He should have felt that his\nown sister was more original, and had greater vitality than Miss\nHilbery had; but his main impression of Katharine now was of a person\nof great vitality and composure; and at the moment he could not\nperceive what poor dear Joan had gained from the fact that she was the\ngranddaughter of a man who kept a shop, and herself earned her own\nliving. The infinite dreariness and sordidness of their life oppressed\nhim in spite of his fundamental belief that, as a family, they were\nsomehow remarkable.\n\n\"Shall you talk to mother?\" Joan inquired. \"Because, you see, the\nthing s got to be settled, one way or another. Charles must write to\nUncle John if he s going there.\"\n\nRalph sighed impatiently.\n\n\"I suppose it doesn t much matter either way,\" he exclaimed. \"He s\ndoomed to misery in the long run.\"\n\nA slight flush came into Joan s cheek.\n\n\"You know you re talking nonsense,\" she said. \"It doesn t hurt any one\nto have to earn their own living. I m very glad I have to earn mine.\"\n\nRalph was pleased that she should feel this, and wished her to\ncontinue, but he went on, perversely enough.\n\n\"Isn t that only because you ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself? You\nnever have time for anything decent \"\n\n\"As for instance?\"\n\n\"Well, going for walks, or music, or books, or seeing interesting\npeople. You never do anything that s really worth doing any more than I\ndo.\"\n\n\"I always think you could make this room much nicer, if you liked,\" she\nobserved.\n\n\"What does it matter what sort of room I have when I m forced to spend\nall the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office?\"\n\n\"You said two days ago that you found the law so interesting.\"\n\n\"So it is if one could afford to know anything about it.\"\n\n(\"That s Herbert only just going to bed now,\" Joan interposed, as a\ndoor on the landing slammed vigorously. \"And then he won t get up in\nthe morning.\")\n\nRalph looked at the ceiling, and shut his lips closely together. Why,\nhe wondered, could Joan never for one moment detach her mind from the\ndetails of domestic life? It seemed to him that she was getting more\nand more enmeshed in them, and capable of shorter and less frequent\nflights into the outer world, and yet she was only thirty-three.\n\n\"D you ever pay calls now?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"I don t often have the time. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"It might be a good thing, to get to know new people, that s all.\"\n\n\"Poor Ralph!\" said Joan suddenly, with a smile. \"You think your\nsister s getting very old and very dull that s it, isn t it?\"\n\n\"I don t think anything of the kind,\" he said stoutly, but he flushed.\n\"But you lead a dog s life, Joan. When you re not working in an office,\nyou re worrying over the rest of us. And I m not much good to you, I m\nafraid.\"\n\nJoan rose, and stood for a moment warming her hands, and, apparently,\nmeditating as to whether she should say anything more or not. A feeling\nof great intimacy united the brother and sister, and the semicircular\nlines above their eyebrows disappeared. No, there was nothing more to\nbe said on either side. Joan brushed her brother s head with her hand\nas she passed him, murmured good night, and left the room. For some\nminutes after she had gone Ralph lay quiescent, resting his head on his\nhand, but gradually his eyes filled with thought, and the line\nreappeared on his brow, as the pleasant impression of companionship and\nancient sympathy waned, and he was left to think on alone.\n\nAfter a time he opened his book, and read on steadily, glancing once or\ntwice at his watch, as if he had set himself a task to be accomplished\nin a certain measure of time. Now and then he heard voices in the\nhouse, and the closing of bedroom doors, which showed that the\nbuilding, at the top of which he sat, was inhabited in every one of its\ncells. When midnight struck, Ralph shut his book, and with a candle in\nhis hand, descended to the ground floor, to ascertain that all lights\nwere extinct and all doors locked. It was a threadbare, well-worn house\nthat he thus examined, as if the inmates had grazed down all luxuriance\nand plenty to the verge of decency; and in the night, bereft of life,\nbare places and ancient blemishes were unpleasantly visible. Katharine\nHilbery, he thought, would condemn it off-hand.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " III\n\n\nDenham had accused Katharine Hilbery of belonging to one of the most\ndistinguished families in England, and if any one will take the trouble\nto consult Mr. Galton s \"Hereditary Genius,\" he will find that this\nassertion is not far from the truth. The Alardyces, the Hilberys, the\nMillingtons, and the Otways seem to prove that intellect is a\npossession which can be tossed from one member of a certain group to\nanother almost indefinitely, and with apparent certainty that the\nbrilliant gift will be safely caught and held by nine out of ten of the\nprivileged race. They had been conspicuous judges and admirals, lawyers\nand servants of the State for some years before the richness of the\nsoil culminated in the rarest flower that any family can boast, a great\nwriter, a poet eminent among the poets of England, a Richard Alardyce;\nand having produced him, they proved once more the amazing virtues of\ntheir race by proceeding unconcernedly again with their usual task of\nbreeding distinguished men. They had sailed with Sir John Franklin to\nthe North Pole, and ridden with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow, and\nwhen they were not lighthouses firmly based on rock for the guidance of\ntheir generation, they were steady, serviceable candles, illuminating\nthe ordinary chambers of daily life. Whatever profession you looked at,\nthere was a Warburton or an Alardyce, a Millington or a Hilbery\nsomewhere in authority and prominence.\n\nIt may be said, indeed, that English society being what it is, no very\ngreat merit is required, once you bear a well-known name, to put you\ninto a position where it is easier on the whole to be eminent than\nobscure. And if this is true of the sons, even the daughters, even in\nthe nineteenth century, are apt to become people of\nimportance philanthropists and educationalists if they are spinsters,\nand the wives of distinguished men if they marry. It is true that there\nwere several lamentable exceptions to this rule in the Alardyce group,\nwhich seems to indicate that the cadets of such houses go more rapidly\nto the bad than the children of ordinary fathers and mothers, as if it\nwere somehow a relief to them. But, on the whole, in these first years\nof the twentieth century, the Alardyces and their relations were\nkeeping their heads well above water. One finds them at the tops of\nprofessions, with letters after their names; they sit in luxurious\npublic offices, with private secretaries attached to them; they write\nsolid books in dark covers, issued by the presses of the two great\nuniversities, and when one of them dies the chances are that another of\nthem writes his biography.\n\nNow the source of this nobility was, of course, the poet, and his\nimmediate descendants, therefore, were invested with greater luster\nthan the collateral branches. Mrs. Hilbery, in virtue of her position\nas the only child of the poet, was spiritually the head of the family,\nand Katharine, her daughter, had some superior rank among all the\ncousins and connections, the more so because she was an only child. The\nAlardyces had married and intermarried, and their offspring were\ngenerally profuse, and had a way of meeting regularly in each other s\nhouses for meals and family celebrations which had acquired a\nsemi-sacred character, and were as regularly observed as days of\nfeasting and fasting in the Church.\n\nIn times gone by, Mrs. Hilbery had known all the poets, all the\nnovelists, all the beautiful women and distinguished men of her time.\nThese being now either dead or secluded in their infirm glory, she made\nher house a meeting-place for her own relations, to whom she would\nlament the passing of the great days of the nineteenth century, when\nevery department of letters and art was represented in England by two\nor three illustrious names. Where are their successors? she would ask,\nand the absence of any poet or painter or novelist of the true caliber\nat the present day was a text upon which she liked to ruminate, in a\nsunset mood of benignant reminiscence, which it would have been hard to\ndisturb had there been need. But she was far from visiting their\ninferiority upon the younger generation. She welcomed them very\nheartily to her house, told them her stories, gave them sovereigns and\nices and good advice, and weaved round them romances which had\ngenerally no likeness to the truth.\n\nThe quality of her birth oozed into Katharine s consciousness from a\ndozen different sources as soon as she was able to perceive anything.\nAbove her nursery fireplace hung a photograph of her grandfather s tomb\nin Poets  Corner, and she was told in one of those moments of grown-up\nconfidence which are so tremendously impressive to the child s mind,\nthat he was buried there because he was a \"good and great man.\" Later,\non an anniversary, she was taken by her mother through the fog in a\nhansom cab, and given a large bunch of bright, sweet-scented flowers to\nlay upon his tomb. The candles in the church, the singing and the\nbooming of the organ, were all, she thought, in his honor. Again and\nagain she was brought down into the drawing-room to receive the\nblessing of some awful distinguished old man, who sat, even to her\nchildish eye, somewhat apart, all gathered together and clutching a\nstick, unlike an ordinary visitor in her father s own arm-chair, and\nher father himself was there, unlike himself, too, a little excited and\nvery polite. These formidable old creatures used to take her in their\narms, look very keenly in her eyes, and then to bless her, and tell her\nthat she must mind and be a good girl, or detect a look in her face\nsomething like Richard s as a small boy. That drew down upon her her\nmother s fervent embrace, and she was sent back to the nursery very\nproud, and with a mysterious sense of an important and unexplained\nstate of things, which time, by degrees, unveiled to her.\n\nThere were always visitors uncles and aunts and cousins \"from India,\"\nto be reverenced for their relationship alone, and others of the\nsolitary and formidable class, whom she was enjoined by her parents to\n\"remember all your life.\" By these means, and from hearing constant\ntalk of great men and their works, her earliest conceptions of the\nworld included an august circle of beings to whom she gave the names of\nShakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, and so on, who were, for some\nreason, much more nearly akin to the Hilberys than to other people.\nThey made a kind of boundary to her vision of life, and played a\nconsiderable part in determining her scale of good and bad in her own\nsmall affairs. Her descent from one of these gods was no surprise to\nher, but matter for satisfaction, until, as the years wore on, the\nprivileges of her lot were taken for granted, and certain drawbacks\nmade themselves very manifest. Perhaps it is a little depressing to\ninherit not lands but an example of intellectual and spiritual virtue;\nperhaps the conclusiveness of a great ancestor is a little discouraging\nto those who run the risk of comparison with him. It seems as if,\nhaving flowered so splendidly, nothing now remained possible but a\nsteady growth of good, green stalk and leaf. For these reasons, and for\nothers, Katharine had her moments of despondency. The glorious past, in\nwhich men and women grew to unexampled size, intruded too much upon the\npresent, and dwarfed it too consistently, to be altogether encouraging\nto one forced to make her experiment in living when the great age was\ndead.\n\nShe was drawn to dwell upon these matters more than was natural, in the\nfirst place owing to her mother s absorption in them, and in the second\nbecause a great part of her time was spent in imagination with the\ndead, since she was helping her mother to produce a life of the great\npoet. When Katharine was seventeen or eighteen that is to say, some ten\nyears ago her mother had enthusiastically announced that now, with a\ndaughter to help her, the biography would soon be published. Notices to\nthis effect found their way into the literary papers, and for some time\nKatharine worked with a sense of great pride and achievement.\n\nLately, however, it had seemed to her that they were making no way at\nall, and this was the more tantalizing because no one with the ghost of\na literary temperament could doubt but that they had materials for one\nof the greatest biographies that has ever been written. Shelves and\nboxes bulged with the precious stuff. The most private lives of the\nmost interesting people lay furled in yellow bundles of close-written\nmanuscript. In addition to this Mrs. Hilbery had in her own head as\nbright a vision of that time as now remained to the living, and could\ngive those flashes and thrills to the old words which gave them almost\nthe substance of flesh. She had no difficulty in writing, and covered a\npage every morning as instinctively as a thrush sings, but\nnevertheless, with all this to urge and inspire, and the most devout\nintention to accomplish the work, the book still remained unwritten.\nPapers accumulated without much furthering their task, and in dull\nmoments Katharine had her doubts whether they would ever produce\nanything at all fit to lay before the public. Where did the difficulty\nlie? Not in their materials, alas! nor in their ambitions, but in\nsomething more profound, in her own inaptitude, and above all, in her\nmother s temperament. Katharine would calculate that she had never\nknown her write for more than ten minutes at a time. Ideas came to her\nchiefly when she was in motion. She liked to perambulate the room with\na duster in her hand, with which she stopped to polish the backs of\nalready lustrous books, musing and romancing as she did so. Suddenly\nthe right phrase or the penetrating point of view would suggest itself,\nand she would drop her duster and write ecstatically for a few\nbreathless moments; and then the mood would pass away, and the duster\nwould be sought for, and the old books polished again. These spells of\ninspiration never burnt steadily, but flickered over the gigantic mass\nof the subject as capriciously as a will-o -the-wisp, lighting now on\nthis point, now on that. It was as much as Katharine could do to keep\nthe pages of her mother s manuscript in order, but to sort them so that\nthe sixteenth year of Richard Alardyce s life succeeded the fifteenth\nwas beyond her skill. And yet they were so brilliant, these paragraphs,\nso nobly phrased, so lightning-like in their illumination, that the\ndead seemed to crowd the very room. Read continuously, they produced a\nsort of vertigo, and set her asking herself in despair what on earth\nshe was to do with them? Her mother refused, also, to face the radical\nquestions of what to leave in and what to leave out. She could not\ndecide how far the public was to be told the truth about the poet s\nseparation from his wife. She drafted passages to suit either case, and\nthen liked each so well that she could not decide upon the rejection of\neither.\n\nBut the book must be written. It was a duty that they owed the world,\nand to Katharine, at least, it meant more than that, for if they could\nnot between them get this one book accomplished they had no right to\ntheir privileged position. Their increment became yearly more and more\nunearned. Besides, it must be established indisputably that her\ngrandfather was a very great man.\n\nBy the time she was twenty-seven, these thoughts had become very\nfamiliar to her. They trod their way through her mind as she sat\nopposite her mother of a morning at a table heaped with bundles of old\nletters and well supplied with pencils, scissors, bottles of gum,\nindia-rubber bands, large envelopes, and other appliances for the\nmanufacture of books. Shortly before Ralph Denham s visit, Katharine\nhad resolved to try the effect of strict rules upon her mother s habits\nof literary composition. They were to be seated at their tables every\nmorning at ten o clock, with a clean-swept morning of empty, secluded\nhours before them. They were to keep their eyes fast upon the paper,\nand nothing was to tempt them to speech, save at the stroke of the hour\nwhen ten minutes for relaxation were to be allowed them. If these rules\nwere observed for a year, she made out on a sheet of paper that the\ncompletion of the book was certain, and she laid her scheme before her\nmother with a feeling that much of the task was already accomplished.\nMrs. Hilbery examined the sheet of paper very carefully. Then she\nclapped her hands and exclaimed enthusiastically:\n\n\"Well done, Katharine! What a wonderful head for business you ve got!\nNow I shall keep this before me, and every day I shall make a little\nmark in my pocketbook, and on the last day of all let me think, what\nshall we do to celebrate the last day of all? If it weren t the winter\nwe could take a jaunt to Italy. They say Switzerland s very lovely in\nthe snow, except for the cold. But, as you say, the great thing is to\nfinish the book. Now let me see \"\n\nWhen they inspected her manuscripts, which Katharine had put in order,\nthey found a state of things well calculated to dash their spirits, if\nthey had not just resolved on reform. They found, to begin with, a\ngreat variety of very imposing paragraphs with which the biography was\nto open; many of these, it is true, were unfinished, and resembled\ntriumphal arches standing upon one leg, but, as Mrs. Hilbery observed,\nthey could be patched up in ten minutes, if she gave her mind to it.\nNext, there was an account of the ancient home of the Alardyces, or\nrather, of spring in Suffolk, which was very beautifully written,\nalthough not essential to the story. However, Katharine had put\ntogether a string of names and dates, so that the poet was capably\nbrought into the world, and his ninth year was reached without further\nmishap. After that, Mrs. Hilbery wished, for sentimental reasons, to\nintroduce the recollections of a very fluent old lady, who had been\nbrought up in the same village, but these Katharine decided must go. It\nmight be advisable to introduce here a sketch of contemporary poetry\ncontributed by Mr. Hilbery, and thus terse and learned and altogether\nout of keeping with the rest, but Mrs. Hilbery was of opinion that it\nwas too bare, and made one feel altogether like a good little girl in a\nlecture-room, which was not at all in keeping with her father. It was\nput on one side. Now came the period of his early manhood, when various\naffairs of the heart must either be concealed or revealed; here again\nMrs. Hilbery was of two minds, and a thick packet of manuscript was\nshelved for further consideration.\n\nSeveral years were now altogether omitted, because Mrs. Hilbery had\nfound something distasteful to her in that period, and had preferred to\ndwell upon her own recollections as a child. After this, it seemed to\nKatharine that the book became a wild dance of will-o -the-wisps,\nwithout form or continuity, without coherence even, or any attempt to\nmake a narrative. Here were twenty pages upon her grandfather s taste\nin hats, an essay upon contemporary china, a long account of a summer\nday s expedition into the country, when they had missed their train,\ntogether with fragmentary visions of all sorts of famous men and women,\nwhich seemed to be partly imaginary and partly authentic. There were,\nmoreover, thousands of letters, and a mass of faithful recollections\ncontributed by old friends, which had grown yellow now in their\nenvelopes, but must be placed somewhere, or their feelings would be\nhurt. So many volumes had been written about the poet since his death\nthat she had also to dispose of a great number of misstatements, which\ninvolved minute researches and much correspondence. Sometimes Katharine\nbrooded, half crushed, among her papers; sometimes she felt that it was\nnecessary for her very existence that she should free herself from the\npast; at others, that the past had completely displaced the present,\nwhich, when one resumed life after a morning among the dead, proved to\nbe of an utterly thin and inferior composition.\n\nThe worst of it was that she had no aptitude for literature. She did\nnot like phrases. She had even some natural antipathy to that process\nof self-examination, that perpetual effort to understand one s own\nfeeling, and express it beautifully, fitly, or energetically in\nlanguage, which constituted so great a part of her mother s existence.\nShe was, on the contrary, inclined to be silent; she shrank from\nexpressing herself even in talk, let alone in writing. As this\ndisposition was highly convenient in a family much given to the\nmanufacture of phrases, and seemed to argue a corresponding capacity\nfor action, she was, from her childhood even, put in charge of\nhousehold affairs. She had the reputation, which nothing in her manner\ncontradicted, of being the most practical of people. Ordering meals,\ndirecting servants, paying bills, and so contriving that every clock\nticked more or less accurately in time, and a number of vases were\nalways full of fresh flowers was supposed to be a natural endowment of\nhers, and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery often observed that it was poetry the\nwrong side out. From a very early age, too, she had to exert herself in\nanother capacity; she had to counsel and help and generally sustain her\nmother. Mrs. Hilbery would have been perfectly well able to sustain\nherself if the world had been what the world is not. She was\nbeautifully adapted for life in another planet. But the natural genius\nshe had for conducting affairs there was of no real use to her here.\nHer watch, for example, was a constant source of surprise to her, and\nat the age of sixty-five she was still amazed at the ascendancy which\nrules and reasons exerted over the lives of other people. She had never\nlearnt her lesson, and had constantly to be punished for her ignorance.\nBut as that ignorance was combined with a fine natural insight which\nsaw deep whenever it saw at all, it was not possible to write Mrs.\nHilbery off among the dunces; on the contrary, she had a way of seeming\nthe wisest person in the room. But, on the whole, she found it very\nnecessary to seek support in her daughter.\n\nKatharine, thus, was a member of a very great profession which has, as\nyet, no title and very little recognition, although the labor of mill\nand factory is, perhaps, no more severe and the results of less benefit\nto the world. She lived at home. She did it very well, too. Any one\ncoming to the house in Cheyne Walk felt that here was an orderly place,\nshapely, controlled a place where life had been trained to show to the\nbest advantage, and, though composed of different elements, made to\nappear harmonious and with a character of its own. Perhaps it was the\nchief triumph of Katharine s art that Mrs. Hilbery s character\npredominated. She and Mr. Hilbery appeared to be a rich background for\nher mother s more striking qualities.\n\nSilence being, thus, both natural to her and imposed upon her, the only\nother remark that her mother s friends were in the habit of making\nabout it was that it was neither a stupid silence nor an indifferent\nsilence. But to what quality it owed its character, since character of\nsome sort it had, no one troubled themselves to inquire. It was\nunderstood that she was helping her mother to produce a great book. She\nwas known to manage the household. She was certainly beautiful. That\naccounted for her satisfactorily. But it would have been a surprise,\nnot only to other people but to Katharine herself, if some magic watch\ncould have taken count of the moments spent in an entirely different\noccupation from her ostensible one. Sitting with faded papers before\nher, she took part in a series of scenes such as the taming of wild\nponies upon the American prairies, or the conduct of a vast ship in a\nhurricane round a black promontory of rock, or in others more peaceful,\nbut marked by her complete emancipation from her present surroundings\nand, needless to say, by her surpassing ability in her new vocation.\nWhen she was rid of the pretense of paper and pen, phrase-making and\nbiography, she turned her attention in a more legitimate direction,\nthough, strangely enough, she would rather have confessed her wildest\ndreams of hurricane and prairie than the fact that, upstairs, alone in\nher room, she rose early in the morning or sat up late at night to...\nwork at mathematics. No force on earth would have made her confess\nthat. Her actions when thus engaged were furtive and secretive, like\nthose of some nocturnal animal. Steps had only to sound on the\nstaircase, and she slipped her paper between the leaves of a great\nGreek dictionary which she had purloined from her father s room for\nthis purpose. It was only at night, indeed, that she felt secure enough\nfrom surprise to concentrate her mind to the utmost.\n\nPerhaps the unwomanly nature of the science made her instinctively wish\nto conceal her love of it. But the more profound reason was that in her\nmind mathematics were directly opposed to literature. She would not\nhave cared to confess how infinitely she preferred the exactitude, the\nstar-like impersonality, of figures to the confusion, agitation, and\nvagueness of the finest prose. There was something a little unseemly in\nthus opposing the tradition of her family; something that made her feel\nwrong-headed, and thus more than ever disposed to shut her desires away\nfrom view and cherish them with extraordinary fondness. Again and again\nshe was thinking of some problem when she should have been thinking of\nher grandfather. Waking from these trances, she would see that her\nmother, too, had lapsed into some dream almost as visionary as her own,\nfor the people who played their parts in it had long been numbered\namong the dead. But, seeing her own state mirrored in her mother s\nface, Katharine would shake herself awake with a sense of irritation.\nHer mother was the last person she wished to resemble, much though she\nadmired her. Her common sense would assert itself almost brutally, and\nMrs. Hilbery, looking at her with her odd sidelong glance, that was\nhalf malicious and half tender, would liken her to \"your wicked old\nUncle Judge Peter, who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in\nthe bathroom. Thank Heaven, Katharine, I ve not a drop of _him_ in me!\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IV\n\n\nAt about nine o clock at night, on every alternate Wednesday, Miss Mary\nDatchet made the same resolve, that she would never again lend her\nrooms for any purposes whatsoever. Being, as they were, rather large\nand conveniently situated in a street mostly dedicated to offices off\nthe Strand, people who wished to meet, either for purposes of\nenjoyment, or to discuss art, or to reform the State, had a way of\nsuggesting that Mary had better be asked to lend them her rooms. She\nalways met the request with the same frown of well-simulated annoyance,\nwhich presently dissolved in a kind of half-humorous, half-surly shrug,\nas of a large dog tormented by children who shakes his ears. She would\nlend her room, but only on condition that all the arrangements were\nmade by her. This fortnightly meeting of a society for the free\ndiscussion of everything entailed a great deal of moving, and pulling,\nand ranging of furniture against the wall, and placing of breakable and\nprecious things in safe places. Miss Datchet was quite capable of\nlifting a kitchen table on her back, if need were, for although\nwell-proportioned and dressed becomingly, she had the appearance of\nunusual strength and determination.\n\nShe was some twenty-five years of age, but looked older because she\nearned, or intended to earn, her own living, and had already lost the\nlook of the irresponsible spectator, and taken on that of the private\nin the army of workers. Her gestures seemed to have a certain purpose,\nthe muscles round eyes and lips were set rather firmly, as though the\nsenses had undergone some discipline, and were held ready for a call on\nthem. She had contracted two faint lines between her eyebrows, not from\nanxiety but from thought, and it was quite evident that all the\nfeminine instincts of pleasing, soothing, and charming were crossed by\nothers in no way peculiar to her sex. For the rest she was brown-eyed,\na little clumsy in movement, and suggested country birth and a descent\nfrom respectable hard-working ancestors, who had been men of faith and\nintegrity rather than doubters or fanatics.\n\nAt the end of a fairly hard day s work it was certainly something of an\neffort to clear one s room, to pull the mattress off one s bed, and lay\nit on the floor, to fill a pitcher with cold coffee, and to sweep a\nlong table clear for plates and cups and saucers, with pyramids of\nlittle pink biscuits between them; but when these alterations were\neffected, Mary felt a lightness of spirit come to her, as if she had\nput off the stout stuff of her working hours and slipped over her\nentire being some vesture of thin, bright silk. She knelt before the\nfire and looked out into the room. The light fell softly, but with\nclear radiance, through shades of yellow and blue paper, and the room,\nwhich was set with one or two sofas resembling grassy mounds in their\nlack of shape, looked unusually large and quiet. Mary was led to think\nof the heights of a Sussex down, and the swelling green circle of some\ncamp of ancient warriors. The moonlight would be falling there so\npeacefully now, and she could fancy the rough pathway of silver upon\nthe wrinkled skin of the sea.\n\n\"And here we are,\" she said, half aloud, half satirically, yet with\nevident pride, \"talking about art.\"\n\nShe pulled a basket containing balls of differently colored wools and a\npair of stockings which needed darning towards her, and began to set\nher fingers to work; while her mind, reflecting the lassitude of her\nbody, went on perversely, conjuring up visions of solitude and quiet,\nand she pictured herself laying aside her knitting and walking out on\nto the down, and hearing nothing but the sheep cropping the grass close\nto the roots, while the shadows of the little trees moved very slightly\nthis way and that in the moonlight, as the breeze went through them.\nBut she was perfectly conscious of her present situation, and derived\nsome pleasure from the reflection that she could rejoice equally in\nsolitude, and in the presence of the many very different people who\nwere now making their way, by divers paths, across London to the spot\nwhere she was sitting.\n\nAs she ran her needle in and out of the wool, she thought of the\nvarious stages in her own life which made her present position seem the\nculmination of successive miracles. She thought of her clerical father\nin his country parsonage, and of her mother s death, and of her own\ndetermination to obtain education, and of her college life, which had\nmerged, not so very long ago, in the wonderful maze of London, which\nstill seemed to her, in spite of her constitutional level-headedness,\nlike a vast electric light, casting radiance upon the myriads of men\nand women who crowded round it. And here she was at the very center of\nit all, that center which was constantly in the minds of people in\nremote Canadian forests and on the plains of India, when their thoughts\nturned to England. The nine mellow strokes, by which she was now\napprised of the hour, were a message from the great clock at\nWestminster itself. As the last of them died away, there was a firm\nknocking on her own door, and she rose and opened it. She returned to\nthe room, with a look of steady pleasure in her eyes, and she was\ntalking to Ralph Denham, who followed her.\n\n\"Alone?\" he said, as if he were pleasantly surprised by that fact.\n\n\"I am sometimes alone,\" she replied.\n\n\"But you expect a great many people,\" he added, looking round him.\n\"It s like a room on the stage. Who is it to-night?\"\n\n\"William Rodney, upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor. I expect a good\nsolid paper, with plenty of quotations from the classics.\"\n\nRalph warmed his hands at the fire, which was flapping bravely in the\ngrate, while Mary took up her stocking again.\n\n\"I suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own\nstockings,\" he observed.\n\n\"I m only one of a great many thousands really,\" she replied, \"though I\nmust admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in.\nAnd now that you re here I don t think myself remarkable at all. How\nhorrid of you! But I m afraid you re much more remarkable than I am.\nYou ve done much more than I ve done.\"\n\n\"If that s your standard, you ve nothing to be proud of,\" said Ralph\ngrimly.\n\n\"Well, I must reflect with Emerson that it s being and not doing that\nmatters,\" she continued.\n\n\"Emerson?\" Ralph exclaimed, with derision. \"You don t mean to say you\nread Emerson?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it wasn t Emerson; but why shouldn t I read Emerson?\" she\nasked, with a tinge of anxiety.\n\n\"There s no reason that I know of. It s the combination that s\nodd books and stockings. The combination is very odd.\" But it seemed to\nrecommend itself to him. Mary gave a little laugh, expressive of\nhappiness, and the particular stitches that she was now putting into\nher work appeared to her to be done with singular grace and felicity.\nShe held out the stocking and looked at it approvingly.\n\n\"You always say that,\" she said. \"I assure you it s a common\n combination,  as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. The only\nthing that s odd about me is that I enjoy them both Emerson and the\nstocking.\"\n\nA knock was heard, and Ralph exclaimed:\n\n\"Damn those people! I wish they weren t coming!\"\n\n\"It s only Mr. Turner, on the floor below,\" said Mary, and she felt\ngrateful to Mr. Turner for having alarmed Ralph, and for having given a\nfalse alarm.\n\n\"Will there be a crowd?\" Ralph asked, after a pause.\n\n\"There ll be the Morrises and the Crashaws, and Dick Osborne, and\nSeptimus, and all that set. Katharine Hilbery is coming, by the way, so\nWilliam Rodney told me.\"\n\n\"Katharine Hilbery!\" Ralph exclaimed.\n\n\"You know her?\" Mary asked, with some surprise.\n\n\"I went to a tea-party at her house.\"\n\nMary pressed him to tell her all about it, and Ralph was not at all\nunwilling to exhibit proofs of the extent of his knowledge. He\ndescribed the scene with certain additions and exaggerations which\ninterested Mary very much.\n\n\"But, in spite of what you say, I do admire her,\" she said. \"I ve only\nseen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one calls a\n personality. \"\n\n\"I didn t mean to abuse her. I only felt that she wasn t very\nsympathetic to me.\"\n\n\"They say she s going to marry that queer creature Rodney.\"\n\n\"Marry Rodney? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her.\"\n\n\"Now that s my door, all right,\" Mary exclaimed, carefully putting her\nwools away, as a succession of knocks reverberated unnecessarily,\naccompanied by a sound of people stamping their feet and laughing. A\nmoment later the room was full of young men and women, who came in with\na peculiar look of expectation, exclaimed \"Oh!\" when they saw Denham,\nand then stood still, gaping rather foolishly.\n\nThe room very soon contained between twenty and thirty people, who\nfound seats for the most part upon the floor, occupying the mattresses,\nand hunching themselves together into triangular shapes. They were all\nyoung and some of them seemed to make a protest by their hair and\ndress, and something somber and truculent in the expression of their\nfaces, against the more normal type, who would have passed unnoticed in\nan omnibus or an underground railway. It was notable that the talk was\nconfined to groups, and was, at first, entirely spasmodic in character,\nand muttered in undertones as if the speakers were suspicious of their\nfellow-guests.\n\nKatharine Hilbery came in rather late, and took up a position on the\nfloor, with her back against the wall. She looked round quickly,\nrecognized about half a dozen people, to whom she nodded, but failed to\nsee Ralph, or, if so, had already forgotten to attach any name to him.\nBut in a second these heterogeneous elements were all united by the\nvoice of Mr. Rodney, who suddenly strode up to the table, and began\nvery rapidly in high-strained tones:\n\n\"In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry \"\n\nAll the different heads swung slightly or steadied themselves into a\nposition in which they could gaze straight at the speaker s face, and\nthe same rather solemn expression was visible on all of them. But, at\nthe same time, even the faces that were most exposed to view, and\ntherefore most tautly under control, disclosed a sudden impulsive\ntremor which, unless directly checked, would have developed into an\noutburst of laughter. The first sight of Mr. Rodney was irresistibly\nludicrous. He was very red in the face, whether from the cool November\nnight or nervousness, and every movement, from the way he wrung his\nhands to the way he jerked his head to right and left, as though a\nvision drew him now to the door, now to the window, bespoke his\nhorrible discomfort under the stare of so many eyes. He was\nscrupulously well dressed, and a pearl in the center of his tie seemed\nto give him a touch of aristocratic opulence. But the rather prominent\neyes and the impulsive stammering manner, which seemed to indicate a\ntorrent of ideas intermittently pressing for utterance and always\nchecked in their course by a clutch of nervousness, drew no pity, as in\nthe case of a more imposing personage, but a desire to laugh, which\nwas, however, entirely lacking in malice. Mr. Rodney was evidently so\npainfully conscious of the oddity of his appearance, and his very\nredness and the starts to which his body was liable gave such proof of\nhis own discomfort, that there was something endearing in this\nridiculous susceptibility, although most people would probably have\nechoed Denham s private exclamation, \"Fancy marrying a creature like\nthat!\"\n\nHis paper was carefully written out, but in spite of this precaution\nMr. Rodney managed to turn over two sheets instead of one, to choose\nthe wrong sentence where two were written together, and to discover his\nown handwriting suddenly illegible. When he found himself possessed of\na coherent passage, he shook it at his audience almost aggressively,\nand then fumbled for another. After a distressing search a fresh\ndiscovery would be made, and produced in the same way, until, by means\nof repeated attacks, he had stirred his audience to a degree of\nanimation quite remarkable in these gatherings. Whether they were\nstirred by his enthusiasm for poetry or by the contortions which a\nhuman being was going through for their benefit, it would be hard to\nsay. At length Mr. Rodney sat down impulsively in the middle of a\nsentence, and, after a pause of bewilderment, the audience expressed\nits relief at being able to laugh aloud in a decided outburst of\napplause.\n\nMr. Rodney acknowledged this with a wild glance round him, and, instead\nof waiting to answer questions, he jumped up, thrust himself through\nthe seated bodies into the corner where Katharine was sitting, and\nexclaimed, very audibly:\n\n\"Well, Katharine, I hope I ve made a big enough fool of myself even for\nyou! It was terrible! terrible! terrible!\"\n\n\"Hush! You must answer their questions,\" Katharine whispered, desiring,\nat all costs, to keep him quiet. Oddly enough, when the speaker was no\nlonger in front of them, there seemed to be much that was suggestive in\nwhat he had said. At any rate, a pale-faced young man with sad eyes was\nalready on his feet, delivering an accurately worded speech with\nperfect composure. William Rodney listened with a curious lifting of\nhis upper lip, although his face was still quivering slightly with\nemotion.\n\n\"Idiot!\" he whispered. \"He s misunderstood every word I said!\"\n\n\"Well then, answer him,\" Katharine whispered back.\n\n\"No, I shan t! They d only laugh at me. Why did I let you persuade me\nthat these sort of people care for literature?\" he continued.\n\nThere was much to be said both for and against Mr. Rodney s paper. It\nhad been crammed with assertions that such-and-such passages, taken\nliberally from English, French, and Italian, are the supreme pearls of\nliterature. Further, he was fond of using metaphors which, compounded\nin the study, were apt to sound either cramped or out of place as he\ndelivered them in fragments. Literature was a fresh garland of spring\nflowers, he said, in which yew-berries and the purple nightshade\nmingled with the various tints of the anemone; and somehow or other\nthis garland encircled marble brows. He had read very badly some very\nbeautiful quotations. But through his manner and his confusion of\nlanguage there had emerged some passion of feeling which, as he spoke,\nformed in the majority of the audience a little picture or an idea\nwhich each now was eager to give expression to. Most of the people\nthere proposed to spend their lives in the practice either of writing\nor painting, and merely by looking at them it could be seen that, as\nthey listened to Mr. Purvis first, and then to Mr. Greenhalgh, they\nwere seeing something done by these gentlemen to a possession which\nthey thought to be their own. One person after another rose, and, as\nwith an ill-balanced axe, attempted to hew out his conception of art a\nlittle more clearly, and sat down with the feeling that, for some\nreason which he could not grasp, his strokes had gone awry. As they sat\ndown they turned almost invariably to the person sitting next them, and\nrectified and continued what they had just said in public. Before long,\ntherefore, the groups on the mattresses and the groups on the chairs\nwere all in communication with each other, and Mary Datchet, who had\nbegun to darn stockings again, stooped down and remarked to Ralph:\n\n\"That was what I call a first-rate paper.\"\n\nBoth of them instinctively turned their eyes in the direction of the\nreader of the paper. He was lying back against the wall, with his eyes\napparently shut, and his chin sunk upon his collar. Katharine was\nturning over the pages of his manuscript as if she were looking for\nsome passage that had particularly struck her, and had a difficulty in\nfinding it.\n\n\"Let s go and tell him how much we liked it,\" said Mary, thus\nsuggesting an action which Ralph was anxious to take, though without\nher he would have been too proud to do it, for he suspected that he had\nmore interest in Katharine than she had in him.\n\n\"That was a very interesting paper,\" Mary began, without any shyness,\nseating herself on the floor opposite to Rodney and Katharine. \"Will\nyou lend me the manuscript to read in peace?\"\n\nRodney, who had opened his eyes on their approach, regarded her for a\nmoment in suspicious silence.\n\n\"Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure?\"\nhe asked.\n\nKatharine looked up from her reading with a smile.\n\n\"He says he doesn t mind what we think of him,\" she remarked. \"He says\nwe don t care a rap for art of any kind.\"\n\n\"I asked her to pity me, and she teases me!\" Rodney exclaimed.\n\n\"I don t intend to pity you, Mr. Rodney,\" Mary remarked, kindly, but\nfirmly. \"When a paper s a failure, nobody says anything, whereas now,\njust listen to them!\"\n\nThe sound, which filled the room, with its hurry of short syllables,\nits sudden pauses, and its sudden attacks, might be compared to some\nanimal hubbub, frantic and inarticulate.\n\n\"D you think that s all about my paper?\" Rodney inquired, after a\nmoment s attention, with a distinct brightening of expression.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Mary. \"It was a very suggestive paper.\"\n\nShe turned to Denham for confirmation, and he corroborated her.\n\n\"It s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it s\nbeen a success or not,\" he said. \"If I were you, Rodney, I should be\nvery pleased with myself.\"\n\nThis commendation seemed to comfort Mr. Rodney completely, and he began\nto bethink him of all the passages in his paper which deserved to be\ncalled \"suggestive.\"\n\n\"Did you agree at all, Denham, with what I said about Shakespeare s\nlater use of imagery? I m afraid I didn t altogether make my meaning\nplain.\"\n\nHere he gathered himself together, and by means of a series of\nfrog-like jerks, succeeded in bringing himself close to Denham.\n\nDenham answered him with the brevity which is the result of having\nanother sentence in the mind to be addressed to another person. He\nwished to say to Katharine: \"Did you remember to get that picture\nglazed before your aunt came to dinner?\" but, besides having to answer\nRodney, he was not sure that the remark, with its assertion of\nintimacy, would not strike Katharine as impertinent. She was listening\nto what some one in another group was saying. Rodney, meanwhile, was\ntalking about the Elizabethan dramatists.\n\nHe was a curious-looking man since, upon first sight, especially if he\nchanced to be talking with animation, he appeared, in some way,\nridiculous; but, next moment, in repose, his face, with its large nose,\nthin cheeks and lips expressing the utmost sensibility, somehow\nrecalled a Roman head bound with laurel, cut upon a circle of\nsemi-transparent reddish stone. It had dignity and character. By\nprofession a clerk in a Government office, he was one of those martyred\nspirits to whom literature is at once a source of divine joy and of\nalmost intolerable irritation. Not content to rest in their love of it,\nthey must attempt to practise it themselves, and they are generally\nendowed with very little facility in composition. They condemn whatever\nthey produce. Moreover, the violence of their feelings is such that\nthey seldom meet with adequate sympathy, and being rendered very\nsensitive by their cultivated perceptions, suffer constant slights both\nto their own persons and to the thing they worship. But Rodney could\nnever resist making trial of the sympathies of any one who seemed\nfavorably disposed, and Denham s praise had stimulated his very\nsusceptible vanity.\n\n\"You remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess?\" he\ncontinued, edging still closer to Denham, and adjusting his elbow and\nknee in an incredibly angular combination. Here, Katharine, who had\nbeen cut off by these maneuvers from all communication with the outer\nworld, rose, and seated herself upon the window-sill, where she was\njoined by Mary Datchet. The two young women could thus survey the whole\nparty. Denham looked after them, and made as if he were tearing\nhandfuls of grass up by the roots from the carpet. But as it fell in\naccurately with his conception of life that all one s desires were\nbound to be frustrated, he concentrated his mind upon literature, and\ndetermined, philosophically, to get what he could out of that.\n\nKatharine was pleasantly excited. A variety of courses was open to her.\nShe knew several people slightly, and at any moment one of them might\nrise from the floor and come and speak to her; on the other hand, she\nmight select somebody for herself, or she might strike into Rodney s\ndiscourse, to which she was intermittently attentive. She was conscious\nof Mary s body beside her, but, at the same time, the consciousness of\nbeing both of them women made it unnecessary to speak to her. But Mary,\nfeeling, as she had said, that Katharine was a \"personality,\" wished so\nmuch to speak to her that in a few moments she did.\n\n\"They re exactly like a flock of sheep, aren t they?\" she said,\nreferring to the noise that rose from the scattered bodies beneath her.\n\nKatharine turned and smiled.\n\n\"I wonder what they re making such a noise about?\" she said.\n\n\"The Elizabethans, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No, I don t think it s got anything to do with the Elizabethans.\nThere! Didn t you hear them say,  Insurance Bill ?\"\n\n\"I wonder why men always talk about politics?\" Mary speculated. \"I\nsuppose, if we had votes, we should, too.\"\n\n\"I dare say we should. And you spend your life in getting us votes,\ndon t you?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Mary, stoutly. \"From ten to six every day I m at it.\"\n\nKatharine looked at Ralph Denham, who was now pounding his way through\nthe metaphysics of metaphor with Rodney, and was reminded of his talk\nthat Sunday afternoon. She connected him vaguely with Mary.\n\n\"I suppose you re one of the people who think we should all have\nprofessions,\" she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way among\nthe phantoms of an unknown world.\n\n\"Oh dear no,\" said Mary at once.\n\n\"Well, I think I do,\" Katharine continued, with half a sigh. \"You will\nalways be able to say that you ve done something, whereas, in a crowd\nlike this, I feel rather melancholy.\"\n\n\"In a crowd? Why in a crowd?\" Mary asked, deepening the two lines\nbetween her eyes, and hoisting herself nearer to Katharine upon the\nwindow-sill.\n\n\"Don t you see how many different things these people care about? And I\nwant to beat them down I only mean,\" she corrected herself, \"that I\nwant to assert myself, and it s difficult, if one hasn t a profession.\"\n\nMary smiled, thinking that to beat people down was a process that\nshould present no difficulty to Miss Katharine Hilbery. They knew each\nother so slightly that the beginning of intimacy, which Katharine\nseemed to initiate by talking about herself, had something solemn in\nit, and they were silent, as if to decide whether to proceed or not.\nThey tested the ground.\n\n\"Ah, but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies!\" Katharine\nannounced, a moment later, with a laugh, as if at the train of thought\nwhich had led her to this conclusion.\n\n\"One doesn t necessarily trample upon people s bodies because one runs\nan office,\" Mary remarked.\n\n\"No. Perhaps not,\" Katharine replied. The conversation lapsed, and Mary\nsaw Katharine looking out into the room rather moodily with closed\nlips, the desire to talk about herself or to initiate a friendship\nhaving, apparently, left her. Mary was struck by her capacity for being\nthus easily silent, and occupied with her own thoughts. It was a habit\nthat spoke of loneliness and a mind thinking for itself. When Katharine\nremained silent Mary was slightly embarrassed.\n\n\"Yes, they re very like sheep,\" she repeated, foolishly.\n\n\"And yet they are very clever at least,\" Katharine added, \"I suppose\nthey have all read Webster.\"\n\n\"Surely you don t think that a proof of cleverness? I ve read Webster,\nI ve read Ben Jonson, but I don t think myself clever not exactly, at\nleast.\"\n\n\"I think you must be very clever,\" Katharine observed.\n\n\"Why? Because I run an office?\"\n\n\"I wasn t thinking of that. I was thinking how you live alone in this\nroom, and have parties.\"\n\nMary reflected for a second.\n\n\"It means, chiefly, a power of being disagreeable to one s own family,\nI think. I have that, perhaps. I didn t want to live at home, and I\ntold my father. He didn t like it.... But then I have a sister, and you\nhaven t, have you?\"\n\n\"No, I haven t any sisters.\"\n\n\"You are writing a life of your grandfather?\" Mary pursued.\n\nKatharine seemed instantly to be confronted by some familiar thought\nfrom which she wished to escape. She replied, \"Yes, I am helping my\nmother,\" in such a way that Mary felt herself baffled, and put back\nagain into the position in which she had been at the beginning of their\ntalk. It seemed to her that Katharine possessed a curious power of\ndrawing near and receding, which sent alternate emotions through her\nfar more quickly than was usual, and kept her in a condition of curious\nalertness. Desiring to classify her, Mary bethought her of the\nconvenient term \"egoist.\"\n\n\"She s an egoist,\" she said to herself, and stored that word up to give\nto Ralph one day when, as it would certainly fall out, they were\ndiscussing Miss Hilbery.\n\n\"Heavens, what a mess there ll be to-morrow morning!\" Katharine\nexclaimed. \"I hope you don t sleep in this room, Miss Datchet?\"\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" Katharine demanded.\n\n\"I won t tell you.\"\n\n\"Let me guess. You were laughing because you thought I d changed the\nconversation?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Because you think \" She paused.\n\n\"If you want to know, I was laughing at the way you said Miss Datchet.\"\n\n\"Mary, then. Mary, Mary, Mary.\"\n\nSo saying, Katharine drew back the curtain in order, perhaps, to\nconceal the momentary flush of pleasure which is caused by coming\nperceptibly nearer to another person.\n\n\"Mary Datchet,\" said Mary. \"It s not such an imposing name as Katharine\nHilbery, I m afraid.\"\n\nThey both looked out of the window, first up at the hard silver moon,\nstationary among a hurry of little grey-blue clouds, and then down upon\nthe roofs of London, with all their upright chimneys, and then below\nthem at the empty moonlit pavement of the street, upon which the joint\nof each paving-stone was clearly marked out. Mary then saw Katharine\nraise her eyes again to the moon, with a contemplative look in them, as\nthough she were setting that moon against the moon of other nights,\nheld in memory. Some one in the room behind them made a joke about\nstar-gazing, which destroyed their pleasure in it, and they looked back\ninto the room again.\n\nRalph had been watching for this moment, and he instantly produced his\nsentence.\n\n\"I wonder, Miss Hilbery, whether you remembered to get that picture\nglazed?\" His voice showed that the question was one that had been\nprepared.\n\n\"Oh, you idiot!\" Mary exclaimed, very nearly aloud, with a sense that\nRalph had said something very stupid. So, after three lessons in Latin\ngrammar, one might correct a fellow student, whose knowledge did not\nembrace the ablative of \"mensa.\"\n\n\"Picture what picture?\" Katharine asked. \"Oh, at home, you mean that\nSunday afternoon. Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came? Yes, I think I\nremembered it.\"\n\nThe three of them stood for a moment awkwardly silent, and then Mary\nleft them in order to see that the great pitcher of coffee was properly\nhandled, for beneath all her education she preserved the anxieties of\none who owns china.\n\nRalph could think of nothing further to say; but could one have\nstripped off his mask of flesh, one would have seen that his will-power\nwas rigidly set upon a single object that Miss Hilbery should obey him.\nHe wished her to stay there until, by some measures not yet apparent to\nhim, he had conquered her interest. These states of mind transmit\nthemselves very often without the use of language, and it was evident\nto Katharine that this young man had fixed his mind upon her. She\ninstantly recalled her first impressions of him, and saw herself again\nproffering family relics. She reverted to the state of mind in which he\nhad left her that Sunday afternoon. She supposed that he judged her\nvery severely. She argued naturally that, if this were the case, the\nburden of the conversation should rest with him. But she submitted so\nfar as to stand perfectly still, her eyes upon the opposite wall, and\nher lips very nearly closed, though the desire to laugh stirred them\nslightly.\n\n\"You know the names of the stars, I suppose?\" Denham remarked, and from\nthe tone of his voice one might have thought that he grudged Katharine\nthe knowledge he attributed to her.\n\nShe kept her voice steady with some difficulty.\n\n\"I know how to find the Pole star if I m lost.\"\n\n\"I don t suppose that often happens to you.\"\n\n\"No. Nothing interesting ever happens to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I think you make a system of saying disagreeable things, Miss\nHilbery,\" he broke out, again going further than he meant to. \"I\nsuppose it s one of the characteristics of your class. They never talk\nseriously to their inferiors.\"\n\nWhether it was that they were meeting on neutral ground to-night, or\nwhether the carelessness of an old grey coat that Denham wore gave an\nease to his bearing that he lacked in conventional dress, Katharine\ncertainly felt no impulse to consider him outside the particular set in\nwhich she lived.\n\n\"In what sense are you my inferior?\" she asked, looking at him gravely,\nas though honestly searching for his meaning. The look gave him great\npleasure. For the first time he felt himself on perfectly equal terms\nwith a woman whom he wished to think well of him, although he could not\nhave explained why her opinion of him mattered one way or another.\nPerhaps, after all, he only wanted to have something of her to take\nhome to think about. But he was not destined to profit by his\nadvantage.\n\n\"I don t think I understand what you mean,\" Katharine repeated, and\nthen she was obliged to stop and answer some one who wished to know\nwhether she would buy a ticket for an opera from them, at a reduction.\nIndeed, the temper of the meeting was now unfavorable to separate\nconversation; it had become rather debauched and hilarious, and people\nwho scarcely knew each other were making use of Christian names with\napparent cordiality, and had reached that kind of gay tolerance and\ngeneral friendliness which human beings in England only attain after\nsitting together for three hours or so, and the first cold blast in the\nair of the street freezes them into isolation once more. Cloaks were\nbeing flung round the shoulders, hats swiftly pinned to the head; and\nDenham had the mortification of seeing Katharine helped to prepare\nherself by the ridiculous Rodney. It was not the convention of the\nmeeting to say good-bye, or necessarily even to nod to the person with\nwhom one was talking; but, nevertheless, Denham was disappointed by the\ncompleteness with which Katharine parted from him, without any attempt\nto finish her sentence. She left with Rodney.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " V\n\n\nDenham had no conscious intention of following Katharine, but, seeing\nher depart, he took his hat and ran rather more quickly down the stairs\nthan he would have done if Katharine had not been in front of him. He\novertook a friend of his, by name Harry Sandys, who was going the same\nway, and they walked together a few paces behind Katharine and Rodney.\n\nThe night was very still, and on such nights, when the traffic thins\naway, the walker becomes conscious of the moon in the street, as if the\ncurtains of the sky had been drawn apart, and the heaven lay bare, as\nit does in the country. The air was softly cool, so that people who had\nbeen sitting talking in a crowd found it pleasant to walk a little\nbefore deciding to stop an omnibus or encounter light again in an\nunderground railway. Sandys, who was a barrister with a philosophic\ntendency, took out his pipe, lit it, murmured \"hum\" and \"ha,\" and was\nsilent. The couple in front of them kept their distance accurately, and\nappeared, so far as Denham could judge by the way they turned towards\neach other, to be talking very constantly. He observed that when a\npedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came\ntogether again directly afterwards. Without intending to watch them he\nnever quite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round Katharine s\nhead, or the light overcoat which made Rodney look fashionable among\nthe crowd. At the Strand he supposed that they would separate, but\ninstead they crossed the road, and took their way down one of the\nnarrow passages which lead through ancient courts to the river. Among\nthe crowd of people in the big thoroughfares Rodney seemed merely to be\nlending Katharine his escort, but now, when passengers were rare and\nthe footsteps of the couple were distinctly heard in the silence,\nDenham could not help picturing to himself some change in their\nconversation. The effect of the light and shadow, which seemed to\nincrease their height, was to make them mysterious and significant, so\nthat Denham had no feeling of irritation with Katharine, but rather a\nhalf-dreamy acquiescence in the course of the world. Yes, she did very\nwell to dream about but Sandys had suddenly begun to talk. He was a\nsolitary man who had made his friends at college and always addressed\nthem as if they were still undergraduates arguing in his room, though\nmany months or even years had passed in some cases between the last\nsentence and the present one. The method was a little singular, but\nvery restful, for it seemed to ignore completely all accidents of human\nlife, and to span very deep abysses with a few simple words.\n\nOn this occasion he began, while they waited for a minute on the edge\nof the Strand:\n\n\"I hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth.\"\n\nDenham returned a suitable answer, and he proceeded to explain how this\ndecision had been arrived at, and what changes it involved in the\nphilosophy which they both accepted. Meanwhile Katharine and Rodney\ndrew further ahead, and Denham kept, if that is the right expression\nfor an involuntary action, one filament of his mind upon them, while\nwith the rest of his intelligence he sought to understand what Sandys\nwas saying.\n\nAs they passed through the courts thus talking, Sandys laid the tip of\nhis stick upon one of the stones forming a time-worn arch, and struck\nit meditatively two or three times in order to illustrate something\nvery obscure about the complex nature of one s apprehension of facts.\nDuring the pause which this necessitated, Katharine and Rodney turned\nthe corner and disappeared. For a moment Denham stopped involuntarily\nin his sentence, and continued it with a sense of having lost\nsomething.\n\nUnconscious that they were observed, Katharine and Rodney had come out\non the Embankment. When they had crossed the road, Rodney slapped his\nhand upon the stone parapet above the river and exclaimed:\n\n\"I promise I won t say another word about it, Katharine! But do stop a\nminute and look at the moon upon the water.\"\n\nKatharine paused, looked up and down the river, and snuffed the air.\n\n\"I m sure one can smell the sea, with the wind blowing this way,\" she\nsaid.\n\nThey stood silent for a few moments while the river shifted in its bed,\nand the silver and red lights which were laid upon it were torn by the\ncurrent and joined together again. Very far off up the river a steamer\nhooted with its hollow voice of unspeakable melancholy, as if from the\nheart of lonely mist-shrouded voyagings.\n\n\"Ah!\" Rodney cried, striking his hand once more upon the balustrade,\n\"why can t one say how beautiful it all is? Why am I condemned for\never, Katharine, to feel what I can t express? And the things I can\ngive there s no use in my giving. Trust me, Katharine,\" he added\nhastily, \"I won t speak of it again. But in the presence of beauty look\nat the iridescence round the moon! one feels one feels Perhaps if you\nmarried me I m half a poet, you see, and I can t pretend not to feel\nwhat I do feel. If I could write ah, that would be another matter. I\nshouldn t bother you to marry me then, Katharine.\"\n\nHe spoke these disconnected sentences rather abruptly, with his eyes\nalternately upon the moon and upon the stream.\n\n\"But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage?\" said Katharine,\nwith her eyes fixed on the moon.\n\n\"Certainly I should. Not for you only, but for all women. Why, you re\nnothing at all without it; you re only half alive; using only half your\nfaculties; you must feel that for yourself. That is why \" Here he\nstopped himself, and they began to walk slowly along the Embankment,\nthe moon fronting them.\n\n     \"With how sad steps she climbs the sky,\n     How silently and with how wan a face,\"\n\nRodney quoted.\n\n\"I ve been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to-night,\"\nKatharine stated, without attending to him. \"Mr. Denham seems to think\nit his mission to lecture me, though I hardly know him. By the way,\nWilliam, you know him; tell me, what is he like?\"\n\nWilliam drew a deep sigh.\n\n\"We may lecture you till we re blue in the face \"\n\n\"Yes but what s he like?\"\n\n\"And we write sonnets to your eyebrows, you cruel practical creature.\nDenham?\" he added, as Katharine remained silent. \"A good fellow, I\nshould think. He cares, naturally, for the right sort of things, I\nexpect. But you mustn t marry him, though. He scolded you, did he what\ndid he say?\"\n\n\"What happens with Mr. Denham is this: He comes to tea. I do all I can\nto put him at his ease. He merely sits and scowls at me. Then I show\nhim our manuscripts. At this he becomes really angry, and tells me I ve\nno business to call myself a middle-class woman. So we part in a huff;\nand next time we meet, which was to-night, he walks straight up to me,\nand says,  Go to the Devil!  That s the sort of behavior my mother\ncomplains of. I want to know, what does it mean?\"\n\nShe paused and, slackening her steps, looked at the lighted train\ndrawing itself smoothly over Hungerford Bridge.\n\n\"It means, I should say, that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic.\"\n\nKatharine laughed with round, separate notes of genuine amusement.\n\n\"It s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house,\" she\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Would your mother object to my being seen with you? No one could\npossibly recognize us, could they?\" Rodney inquired, with some\nsolicitude.\n\nKatharine looked at him, and perceiving that his solicitude was\ngenuine, she laughed again, but with an ironical note in her laughter.\n\n\"You may laugh, Katharine, but I can tell you that if any of your\nfriends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it,\nand I should find that very disagreeable. But why do you laugh?\"\n\n\"I don t know. Because you re such a queer mixture, I think. You re\nhalf poet and half old maid.\"\n\n\"I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous. But I can t help having\ninherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, William. You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire,\nbut that s no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on\nthe Embankment.\"\n\n\"I m ten years older than you are, Katharine, and I know more of the\nworld than you do.\"\n\n\"Very well. Leave me and go home.\"\n\nRodney looked back over his shoulder and perceived that they were being\nfollowed at a short distance by a taxicab, which evidently awaited his\nsummons. Katharine saw it, too, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Don t call that cab for me, William. I shall walk.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Katharine; you ll do nothing of the kind. It s nearly twelve\no clock, and we ve walked too far as it is.\"\n\nKatharine laughed and walked on so quickly that both Rodney and the\ntaxicab had to increase their pace to keep up with her.\n\n\"Now, William,\" she said, \"if people see me racing along the Embankment\nlike this they _will_ talk. You had far better say good-night, if you\ndon t want people to talk.\"\n\nAt this William beckoned, with a despotic gesture, to the cab with one\nhand, and with the other he brought Katharine to a standstill.\n\n\"Don t let the man see us struggling, for God s sake!\" he murmured.\nKatharine stood for a moment quite still.\n\n\"There s more of the old maid in you than the poet,\" she observed\nbriefly.\n\nWilliam shut the door sharply, gave the address to the driver, and\nturned away, lifting his hat punctiliously high in farewell to the\ninvisible lady.\n\nHe looked back after the cab twice, suspiciously, half expecting that\nshe would stop it and dismount; but it bore her swiftly on, and was\nsoon out of sight. William felt in the mood for a short soliloquy of\nindignation, for Katharine had contrived to exasperate him in more ways\nthan one.\n\n\"Of all the unreasonable, inconsiderate creatures I ve ever known,\nshe s the worst!\" he exclaimed to himself, striding back along the\nEmbankment. \"Heaven forbid that I should ever make a fool of myself\nwith her again. Why, I d sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than\nKatharine Hilbery! She d leave me not a moment s peace and she d never\nunderstand me never, never, never!\"\n\nUttered aloud and with vehemence so that the stars of Heaven might\nhear, for there was no human being at hand, these sentiments sounded\nsatisfactorily irrefutable. Rodney quieted down, and walked on in\nsilence, until he perceived some one approaching him, who had\nsomething, either in his walk or his dress, which proclaimed that he\nwas one of William s acquaintances before it was possible to tell which\nof them he was. It was Denham who, having parted from Sandys at the\nbottom of his staircase, was now walking to the Tube at Charing Cross,\ndeep in the thoughts which his talk with Sandys had suggested. He had\nforgotten the meeting at Mary Datchet s rooms, he had forgotten Rodney,\nand metaphors and Elizabethan drama, and could have sworn that he had\nforgotten Katharine Hilbery, too, although that was more disputable.\nHis mind was scaling the highest pinnacles of its alps, where there was\nonly starlight and the untrodden snow. He cast strange eyes upon\nRodney, as they encountered each other beneath a lamp-post.\n\n\"Ha!\" Rodney exclaimed.\n\nIf he had been in full possession of his mind, Denham would probably\nhave passed on with a salutation. But the shock of the interruption\nmade him stand still, and before he knew what he was doing, he had\nturned and was walking with Rodney in obedience to Rodney s invitation\nto come to his rooms and have something to drink. Denham had no wish to\ndrink with Rodney, but he followed him passively enough. Rodney was\ngratified by this obedience. He felt inclined to be communicative with\nthis silent man, who possessed so obviously all the good masculine\nqualities in which Katharine now seemed lamentably deficient.\n\n\"You do well, Denham,\" he began impulsively, \"to have nothing to do\nwith young women. I offer you my experience if one trusts them one\ninvariably has cause to repent. Not that I have any reason at this\nmoment,\" he added hastily, \"to complain of them. It s a subject that\ncrops up now and again for no particular reason. Miss Datchet, I dare\nsay, is one of the exceptions. Do you like Miss Datchet?\"\n\nThese remarks indicated clearly enough that Rodney s nerves were in a\nstate of irritation, and Denham speedily woke to the situation of the\nworld as it had been one hour ago. He had last seen Rodney walking with\nKatharine. He could not help regretting the eagerness with which his\nmind returned to these interests, and fretted him with the old trivial\nanxieties. He sank in his own esteem. Reason bade him break from\nRodney, who clearly tended to become confidential, before he had\nutterly lost touch with the problems of high philosophy. He looked\nalong the road, and marked a lamp-post at a distance of some hundred\nyards, and decided that he would part from Rodney when they reached\nthis point.\n\n\"Yes, I like Mary; I don t see how one could help liking her,\" he\nremarked cautiously, with his eye on the lamp-post.\n\n\"Ah, Denham, you re so different from me. You never give yourself away.\nI watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery. My instinct is to\ntrust the person I m talking to. That s why I m always being taken in,\nI suppose.\"\n\nDenham seemed to be pondering this statement of Rodney s, but, as a\nmatter of fact, he was hardly conscious of Rodney and his revelations,\nand was only concerned to make him mention Katharine again before they\nreached the lamp-post.\n\n\"Who s taken you in now?\" he asked. \"Katharine Hilbery?\"\n\nRodney stopped and once more began beating a kind of rhythm, as if he\nwere marking a phrase in a symphony, upon the smooth stone balustrade\nof the Embankment.\n\n\"Katharine Hilbery,\" he repeated, with a curious little chuckle. \"No,\nDenham, I have no illusions about that young woman. I think I made that\nplain to her to-night. But don t run away with a false impression,\" he\ncontinued eagerly, turning and linking his arm through Denham s, as\nthough to prevent him from escaping; and, thus compelled, Denham passed\nthe monitory lamp-post, to which, in passing, he breathed an excuse,\nfor how could he break away when Rodney s arm was actually linked in\nhis? \"You must not think that I have any bitterness against her far\nfrom it. It s not altogether her fault, poor girl. She lives, you know,\none of those odious, self-centered lives at least, I think them odious\nfor a woman feeding her wits upon everything, having control of\neverything, getting far too much her own way at home spoilt, in a\nsense, feeling that every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how\nshe hurts that is, how rudely she behaves to people who haven t all her\nadvantages. Still, to do her justice, she s no fool,\" he added, as if\nto warn Denham not to take any liberties. \"She has taste. She has\nsense. She can understand you when you talk to her. But she s a woman,\nand there s an end of it,\" he added, with another little chuckle, and\ndropped Denham s arm.\n\n\"And did you tell her all this to-night?\" Denham asked.\n\n\"Oh dear me, no. I should never think of telling Katharine the truth\nabout herself. That wouldn t do at all. One has to be in an attitude of\nadoration in order to get on with Katharine.\"\n\n\"Now I ve learnt that she s refused to marry him why don t I go home?\"\nDenham thought to himself. But he went on walking beside Rodney, and\nfor a time they did not speak, though Rodney hummed snatches of a tune\nout of an opera by Mozart. A feeling of contempt and liking combine\nvery naturally in the mind of one to whom another has just spoken\nunpremeditatedly, revealing rather more of his private feelings than he\nintended to reveal. Denham began to wonder what sort of person Rodney\nwas, and at the same time Rodney began to think about Denham.\n\n\"You re a slave like me, I suppose?\" he asked.\n\n\"A solicitor, yes.\"\n\n\"I sometimes wonder why we don t chuck it. Why don t you emigrate,\nDenham? I should have thought that would suit you.\"\n\n\"I ve a family.\"\n\n\"I m often on the point of going myself. And then I know I couldn t\nlive without this\" and he waved his hand towards the City of London,\nwhich wore, at this moment, the appearance of a town cut out of\ngray-blue cardboard, and pasted flat against the sky, which was of a\ndeeper blue.\n\n\"There are one or two people I m fond of, and there s a little good\nmusic, and a few pictures, now and then just enough to keep one\ndangling about here. Ah, but I couldn t live with savages! Are you fond\nof books? Music? Pictures? D you care at all for first editions? I ve\ngot a few nice things up here, things I pick up cheap, for I can t\nafford to give what they ask.\"\n\nThey had reached a small court of high eighteenth-century houses, in\none of which Rodney had his rooms. They climbed a very steep staircase,\nthrough whose uncurtained windows the moonlight fell, illuminating the\nbanisters with their twisted pillars, and the piles of plates set on\nthe window-sills, and jars half-full of milk. Rodney s rooms were\nsmall, but the sitting-room window looked out into a courtyard, with\nits flagged pavement, and its single tree, and across to the flat\nred-brick fronts of the opposite houses, which would not have surprised\nDr. Johnson, if he had come out of his grave for a turn in the\nmoonlight. Rodney lit his lamp, pulled his curtains, offered Denham a\nchair, and, flinging the manuscript of his paper on the Elizabethan use\nof Metaphor on to the table, exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh dear me, what a waste of time! But it s over now, and so we may\nthink no more about it.\"\n\nHe then busied himself very dexterously in lighting a fire, producing\nglasses, whisky, a cake, and cups and saucers. He put on a faded\ncrimson dressing-gown, and a pair of red slippers, and advanced to\nDenham with a tumbler in one hand and a well-burnished book in the\nother.\n\n\"The Baskerville Congreve,\" said Rodney, offering it to his guest. \"I\ncouldn t read him in a cheap edition.\"\n\nWhen he was seen thus among his books and his valuables, amiably\nanxious to make his visitor comfortable, and moving about with\nsomething of the dexterity and grace of a Persian cat, Denham relaxed\nhis critical attitude, and felt more at home with Rodney than he would\nhave done with many men better known to him. Rodney s room was the room\nof a person who cherishes a great many personal tastes, guarding them\nfrom the rough blasts of the public with scrupulous attention. His\npapers and his books rose in jagged mounds on table and floor, round\nwhich he skirted with nervous care lest his dressing-gown might\ndisarrange them ever so slightly. On a chair stood a stack of\nphotographs of statues and pictures, which it was his habit to exhibit,\none by one, for the space of a day or two. The books on his shelves\nwere as orderly as regiments of soldiers, and the backs of them shone\nlike so many bronze beetle-wings; though, if you took one from its\nplace you saw a shabbier volume behind it, since space was limited. An\noval Venetian mirror stood above the fireplace, and reflected duskily\nin its spotted depths the faint yellow and crimson of a jarful of\ntulips which stood among the letters and pipes and cigarettes upon the\nmantelpiece. A small piano occupied a corner of the room, with the\nscore of \"Don Giovanni\" open upon the bracket.\n\n\"Well, Rodney,\" said Denham, as he filled his pipe and looked about\nhim, \"this is all very nice and comfortable.\"\n\nRodney turned his head half round and smiled, with the pride of a\nproprietor, and then prevented himself from smiling.\n\n\"Tolerable,\" he muttered.\n\n\"But I dare say it s just as well that you have to earn your own\nliving.\"\n\n\"If you mean that I shouldn t do anything good with leisure if I had\nit, I dare say you re right. But I should be ten times as happy with my\nwhole day to spend as I liked.\"\n\n\"I doubt that,\" Denham replied.\n\nThey sat silent, and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably in a\nblue vapor above their heads.\n\n\"I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare,\" Rodney\nremarked. \"And there s music and pictures, let alone the society of the\npeople one likes.\"\n\n\"You d be bored to death in a year s time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I grant you I should be bored if I did nothing. But I should write\nplays.\"\n\n\"H m!\"\n\n\"I should write plays,\" he repeated. \"I ve written three-quarters of\none already, and I m only waiting for a holiday to finish it. And it s\nnot bad no, some of it s really rather nice.\"\n\nThe question arose in Denham s mind whether he should ask to see this\nplay, as, no doubt, he was expected to do. He looked rather stealthily\nat Rodney, who was tapping the coal nervously with a poker, and\nquivering almost physically, so Denham thought, with desire to talk\nabout this play of his, and vanity unrequited and urgent. He seemed\nvery much at Denham s mercy, and Denham could not help liking him,\npartly on that account.\n\n\"Well,... will you let me see the play?\" Denham asked, and Rodney\nlooked immediately appeased, but, nevertheless, he sat silent for a\nmoment, holding the poker perfectly upright in the air, regarding it\nwith his rather prominent eyes, and opening his lips and shutting them\nagain.\n\n\"Do you really care for this kind of thing?\" he asked at length, in a\ndifferent tone of voice from that in which he had been speaking. And,\nwithout waiting for an answer, he went on, rather querulously: \"Very\nfew people care for poetry. I dare say it bores you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Denham remarked.\n\n\"Well, I ll lend it you,\" Rodney announced, putting down the poker.\n\nAs he moved to fetch the play, Denham stretched a hand to the bookcase\nbeside him, and took down the first volume which his fingers touched.\nIt happened to be a small and very lovely edition of Sir Thomas Browne,\ncontaining the \"Urn Burial,\" the \"Hydriotaphia,\" and the \"Garden of\nCyrus,\" and, opening it at a passage which he knew very nearly by\nheart, Denham began to read and, for some time, continued to read.\n\nRodney resumed his seat, with his manuscript on his knee, and from time\nto time he glanced at Denham, and then joined his finger-tips and\ncrossed his thin legs over the fender, as if he experienced a good deal\nof pleasure. At length Denham shut the book, and stood, with his back\nto the fireplace, occasionally making an inarticulate humming sound\nwhich seemed to refer to Sir Thomas Browne. He put his hat on his head,\nand stood over Rodney, who still lay stretched back in his chair, with\nhis toes within the fender.\n\n\"I shall look in again some time,\" Denham remarked, upon which Rodney\nheld up his hand, containing his manuscript, without saying anything\nexcept \"If you like.\"\n\nDenham took the manuscript and went. Two days later he was much\nsurprised to find a thin parcel on his breakfast-plate, which, on being\nopened, revealed the very copy of Sir Thomas Browne which he had\nstudied so intently in Rodney s rooms. From sheer laziness he returned\nno thanks, but he thought of Rodney from time to time with interest,\ndisconnecting him from Katharine, and meant to go round one evening and\nsmoke a pipe with him. It pleased Rodney thus to give away whatever his\nfriends genuinely admired. His library was constantly being diminished.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VI\n\n\nOf all the hours of an ordinary working week-day, which are the\npleasantest to look forward to and to look back upon? If a single\ninstance is of use in framing a theory, it may be said that the minutes\nbetween nine-twenty-five and nine-thirty in the morning had a singular\ncharm for Mary Datchet. She spent them in a very enviable frame of\nmind; her contentment was almost unalloyed. High in the air as her flat\nwas, some beams from the morning sun reached her even in November,\nstriking straight at curtain, chair, and carpet, and painting there\nthree bright, true spaces of green, blue, and purple, upon which the\neye rested with a pleasure which gave physical warmth to the body.\n\nThere were few mornings when Mary did not look up, as she bent to lace\nher boots, and as she followed the yellow rod from curtain to\nbreakfast-table she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness that her\nlife provided her with such moments of pure enjoyment. She was robbing\nno one of anything, and yet, to get so much pleasure from simple\nthings, such as eating one s breakfast alone in a room which had nice\ncolors in it, clean from the skirting of the boards to the corners of\nthe ceiling, seemed to suit her so thoroughly that she used at first to\nhunt about for some one to apologize to, or for some flaw in the\nsituation. She had now been six months in London, and she could find no\nflaw, but that, as she invariably concluded by the time her boots were\nlaced, was solely and entirely due to the fact that she had her work.\nEvery day, as she stood with her dispatch-box in her hand at the door\nof her flat, and gave one look back into the room to see that\neverything was straight before she left, she said to herself that she\nwas very glad that she was going to leave it all, that to have sat\nthere all day long, in the enjoyment of leisure, would have been\nintolerable.\n\nOut in the street she liked to think herself one of the workers who, at\nthis hour, take their way in rapid single file along all the broad\npavements of the city, with their heads slightly lowered, as if all\ntheir effort were to follow each other as closely as might be; so that\nMary used to figure to herself a straight rabbit-run worn by their\nunswerving feet upon the pavement. But she liked to pretend that she\nwas indistinguishable from the rest, and that when a wet day drove her\nto the Underground or omnibus, she gave and took her share of crowd and\nwet with clerks and typists and commercial men, and shared with them\nthe serious business of winding-up the world to tick for another\nfour-and-twenty hours.\n\nThus thinking, on the particular morning in question, she made her away\nacross Lincoln s Inn Fields and up Kingsway, and so through Southampton\nRow until she reached her office in Russell Square. Now and then she\nwould pause and look into the window of some bookseller or flower shop,\nwhere, at this early hour, the goods were being arranged, and empty\ngaps behind the plate glass revealed a state of undress. Mary felt\nkindly disposed towards the shopkeepers, and hoped that they would\ntrick the midday public into purchasing, for at this hour of the\nmorning she ranged herself entirely on the side of the shopkeepers and\nbank clerks, and regarded all who slept late and had money to spend as\nher enemy and natural prey. And directly she had crossed the road at\nHolborn, her thoughts all came naturally and regularly to roost upon\nher work, and she forgot that she was, properly speaking, an amateur\nworker, whose services were unpaid, and could hardly be said to wind\nthe world up for its daily task, since the world, so far, had shown\nvery little desire to take the boons which Mary s society for woman s\nsuffrage had offered it.\n\nShe was thinking all the way up Southampton Row of notepaper and\nfoolscap, and how an economy in the use of paper might be effected\n(without, of course, hurting Mrs. Seal s feelings), for she was certain\nthat the great organizers always pounce, to begin with, upon trifles\nlike these, and build up their triumphant reforms upon a basis of\nabsolute solidity; and, without acknowledging it for a moment, Mary\nDatchet was determined to be a great organizer, and had already doomed\nher society to reconstruction of the most radical kind. Once or twice\nlately, it is true, she had started, broad awake, before turning into\nRussell Square, and denounced herself rather sharply for being already\nin a groove, capable, that is, of thinking the same thoughts every\nmorning at the same hour, so that the chestnut-colored brick of the\nRussell Square houses had some curious connection with her thoughts\nabout office economy, and served also as a sign that she should get\ninto trim for meeting Mr. Clacton, or Mrs. Seal, or whoever might be\nbeforehand with her at the office. Having no religious belief, she was\nthe more conscientious about her life, examining her position from time\nto time very seriously, and nothing annoyed her more than to find one\nof these bad habits nibbling away unheeded at the precious substance.\nWhat was the good, after all, of being a woman if one didn t keep\nfresh, and cram one s life with all sorts of views and experiments?\nThus she always gave herself a little shake, as she turned the corner,\nand, as often as not, reached her own door whistling a snatch of a\nSomersetshire ballad.\n\nThe suffrage office was at the top of one of the large Russell Square\nhouses, which had once been lived in by a great city merchant and his\nfamily, and was now let out in slices to a number of societies which\ndisplayed assorted initials upon doors of ground glass, and kept, each\nof them, a typewriter which clicked busily all day long. The old house,\nwith its great stone staircase, echoed hollowly to the sound of\ntypewriters and of errand-boys from ten to six. The noise of different\ntypewriters already at work, disseminating their views upon the\nprotection of native races, or the value of cereals as foodstuffs,\nquickened Mary s steps, and she always ran up the last flight of steps\nwhich led to her own landing, at whatever hour she came, so as to get\nher typewriter to take its place in competition with the rest.\n\nShe sat herself down to her letters, and very soon all these\nspeculations were forgotten, and the two lines drew themselves between\nher eyebrows, as the contents of the letters, the office furniture, and\nthe sounds of activity in the next room gradually asserted their sway\nupon her. By eleven o clock the atmosphere of concentration was running\nso strongly in one direction that any thought of a different order\ncould hardly have survived its birth more than a moment or so. The task\nwhich lay before her was to organize a series of entertainments, the\nprofits of which were to benefit the society, which drooped for want of\nfunds. It was her first attempt at organization on a large scale, and\nshe meant to achieve something remarkable. She meant to use the\ncumbrous machine to pick out this, that, and the other interesting\nperson from the muddle of the world, and to set them for a week in a\npattern which must catch the eyes of Cabinet Ministers, and the eyes\nonce caught, the old arguments were to be delivered with unexampled\noriginality. Such was the scheme as a whole; and in contemplation of it\nshe would become quite flushed and excited, and have to remind herself\nof all the details that intervened between her and success.\n\nThe door would open, and Mr. Clacton would come in to search for a\ncertain leaflet buried beneath a pyramid of leaflets. He was a thin,\nsandy-haired man of about thirty-five, spoke with a Cockney accent, and\nhad about him a frugal look, as if nature had not dealt generously with\nhim in any way, which, naturally, prevented him from dealing generously\nwith other people. When he had found his leaflet, and offered a few\njocular hints upon keeping papers in order, the typewriting would stop\nabruptly, and Mrs. Seal would burst into the room with a letter which\nneeded explanation in her hand. This was a more serious interruption\nthan the other, because she never knew exactly what she wanted, and\nhalf a dozen requests would bolt from her, no one of which was clearly\nstated. Dressed in plum-colored velveteen, with short, gray hair, and a\nface that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic enthusiasm, she\nwas always in a hurry, and always in some disorder. She wore two\ncrucifixes, which got themselves entangled in a heavy gold chain upon\nher breast, and seemed to Mary expressive of her mental ambiguity. Only\nher vast enthusiasm and her worship of Miss Markham, one of the\npioneers of the society, kept her in her place, for which she had no\nsound qualification.\n\nSo the morning wore on, and the pile of letters grew, and Mary felt, at\nlast, that she was the center ganglion of a very fine network of nerves\nwhich fell over England, and one of these days, when she touched the\nheart of the system, would begin feeling and rushing together and\nemitting their splendid blaze of revolutionary fireworks for some such\nmetaphor represents what she felt about her work, when her brain had\nbeen heated by three hours of application.\n\nShortly before one o clock Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal desisted from\ntheir labors, and the old joke about luncheon, which came out regularly\nat this hour, was repeated with scarcely any variation of words. Mr.\nClacton patronized a vegetarian restaurant; Mrs. Seal brought\nsandwiches, which she ate beneath the plane-trees in Russell Square;\nwhile Mary generally went to a gaudy establishment, upholstered in red\nplush, near by, where, much to the vegetarian s disapproval, you could\nbuy steak, two inches thick, or a roast section of fowl, swimming in a\npewter dish.\n\n\"The bare branches against the sky do one so much _good_,\" Mrs. Seal\nasserted, looking out into the Square.\n\n\"But one can t lunch off trees, Sally,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I confess I don t know how you manage it, Miss Datchet,\" Mr. Clacton\nremarked. \"I should sleep all the afternoon, I know, if I took a heavy\nmeal in the middle of the day.\"\n\n\"What s the very latest thing in literature?\" Mary asked,\ngood-humoredly pointing to the yellow-covered volume beneath Mr.\nClacton s arm, for he invariably read some new French author at\nlunch-time, or squeezed in a visit to a picture gallery, balancing his\nsocial work with an ardent culture of which he was secretly proud, as\nMary had very soon divined.\n\nSo they parted and Mary walked away, wondering if they guessed that she\nreally wanted to get away from them, and supposing that they had not\nquite reached that degree of subtlety. She bought herself an evening\npaper, which she read as she ate, looking over the top of it again and\nagain at the queer people who were buying cakes or imparting their\nsecrets, until some young woman whom she knew came in, and she called\nout, \"Eleanor, come and sit by me,\" and they finished their lunch\ntogether, parting on the strip of pavement among the different lines of\ntraffic with a pleasant feeling that they were stepping once more into\ntheir separate places in the great and eternally moving pattern of\nhuman life.\n\nBut, instead of going straight back to the office to-day, Mary turned\ninto the British Museum, and strolled down the gallery with the shapes\nof stone until she found an empty seat directly beneath the gaze of the\nElgin marbles. She looked at them, and seemed, as usual, borne up on\nsome wave of exaltation and emotion, by which her life at once became\nsolemn and beautiful an impression which was due as much, perhaps, to\nthe solitude and chill and silence of the gallery as to the actual\nbeauty of the statues. One must suppose, at least, that her emotions\nwere not purely esthetic, because, after she had gazed at the Ulysses\nfor a minute or two, she began to think about Ralph Denham. So secure\ndid she feel with these silent shapes that she almost yielded to an\nimpulse to say \"I am in love with you\" aloud. The presence of this\nimmense and enduring beauty made her almost alarmingly conscious of her\ndesire, and at the same time proud of a feeling which did not display\nanything like the same proportions when she was going about her daily\nwork.\n\nShe repressed her impulse to speak aloud, and rose and wandered about\nrather aimlessly among the statues until she found herself in another\ngallery devoted to engraved obelisks and winged Assyrian bulls, and her\nemotion took another turn. She began to picture herself traveling with\nRalph in a land where these monsters were couchant in the sand. \"For,\"\nshe thought to herself, as she gazed fixedly at some information\nprinted behind a piece of glass, \"the wonderful thing about you is that\nyou re ready for anything; you re not in the least conventional, like\nmost clever men.\"\n\nAnd she conjured up a scene of herself on a camel s back, in the\ndesert, while Ralph commanded a whole tribe of natives.\n\n\"That is what you can do,\" she went on, moving on to the next statue.\n\"You always make people do what you want.\"\n\nA glow spread over her spirit, and filled her eyes with brightness.\nNevertheless, before she left the Museum she was very far from saying,\neven in the privacy of her own mind, \"I am in love with you,\" and that\nsentence might very well never have framed itself. She was, indeed,\nrather annoyed with herself for having allowed such an ill-considered\nbreach of her reserve, weakening her powers of resistance, she felt,\nshould this impulse return again. For, as she walked along the street\nto her office, the force of all her customary objections to being in\nlove with any one overcame her. She did not want to marry at all. It\nseemed to her that there was something amateurish in bringing love into\ntouch with a perfectly straightforward friendship, such as hers was\nwith Ralph, which, for two years now, had based itself upon common\ninterests in impersonal topics, such as the housing of the poor, or the\ntaxation of land values.\n\nBut the afternoon spirit differed intrinsically from the morning\nspirit. Mary found herself watching the flight of a bird, or making\ndrawings of the branches of the plane-trees upon her blotting-paper.\nPeople came in to see Mr. Clacton on business, and a seductive smell of\ncigarette smoke issued from his room. Mrs. Seal wandered about with\nnewspaper cuttings, which seemed to her either \"quite splendid\" or\n\"really too bad for words.\" She used to paste these into books, or send\nthem to her friends, having first drawn a broad bar in blue pencil down\nthe margin, a proceeding which signified equally and indistinguishably\nthe depths of her reprobation or the heights of her approval.\n\nAbout four o clock on that same afternoon Katharine Hilbery was walking\nup Kingsway. The question of tea presented itself. The street lamps\nwere being lit already, and as she stood still for a moment beneath one\nof them, she tried to think of some neighboring drawing-room where\nthere would be firelight and talk congenial to her mood. That mood,\nowing to the spinning traffic and the evening veil of unreality, was\nill-adapted to her home surroundings. Perhaps, on the whole, a shop was\nthe best place in which to preserve this queer sense of heightened\nexistence. At the same time she wished to talk. Remembering Mary\nDatchet and her repeated invitations, she crossed the road, turned into\nRussell Square, and peered about, seeking for numbers with a sense of\nadventure that was out of all proportion to the deed itself. She found\nherself in a dimly lighted hall, unguarded by a porter, and pushed open\nthe first swing door. But the office-boy had never heard of Miss\nDatchet. Did she belong to the S.R.F.R.? Katharine shook her head with\na smile of dismay. A voice from within shouted, \"No. The S.G.S. top\nfloor.\"\n\nKatharine mounted past innumerable glass doors, with initials on them,\nand became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom of her\nventure. At the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect\nherself. She heard the typewriter and formal professional voices\ninside, not belonging, she thought, to any one she had ever spoken to.\nShe touched the bell, and the door was opened almost immediately by\nMary herself. Her face had to change its expression entirely when she\nsaw Katharine.\n\n\"You!\" she exclaimed. \"We thought you were the printer.\" Still holding\nthe door open, she called back, \"No, Mr. Clacton, it s not Penningtons.\nI should ring them up again double three double eight, Central. Well,\nthis is a surprise. Come in,\" she added. \"You re just in time for tea.\"\n\nThe light of relief shone in Mary s eyes. The boredom of the afternoon\nwas dissipated at once, and she was glad that Katharine had found them\nin a momentary press of activity, owing to the failure of the printer\nto send back certain proofs.\n\nThe unshaded electric light shining upon the table covered with papers\ndazed Katharine for a moment. After the confusion of her twilight walk,\nand her random thoughts, life in this small room appeared extremely\nconcentrated and bright. She turned instinctively to look out of the\nwindow, which was uncurtained, but Mary immediately recalled her.\n\n\"It was very clever of you to find your way,\" she said, and Katharine\nwondered, as she stood there, feeling, for the moment, entirely\ndetached and unabsorbed, why she had come. She looked, indeed, to\nMary s eyes strangely out of place in the office. Her figure in the\nlong cloak, which took deep folds, and her face, which was composed\ninto a mask of sensitive apprehension, disturbed Mary for a moment with\na sense of the presence of some one who was of another world, and,\ntherefore, subversive of her world. She became immediately anxious that\nKatharine should be impressed by the importance of her world, and hoped\nthat neither Mrs. Seal nor Mr. Clacton would appear until the\nimpression of importance had been received. But in this she was\ndisappointed. Mrs. Seal burst into the room holding a kettle in her\nhand, which she set upon the stove, and then, with inefficient haste,\nshe set light to the gas, which flared up, exploded, and went out.\n\n\"Always the way, always the way,\" she muttered. \"Kit Markham is the\nonly person who knows how to deal with the thing.\"\n\nMary had to go to her help, and together they spread the table, and\napologized for the disparity between the cups and the plainness of the\nfood.\n\n\"If we had known Miss Hilbery was coming, we should have bought a\ncake,\" said Mary, upon which Mrs. Seal looked at Katharine for the\nfirst time, suspiciously, because she was a person who needed cake.\n\nHere Mr. Clacton opened the door, and came in, holding a typewritten\nletter in his hand, which he was reading aloud.\n\n\"Salford s affiliated,\" he said.\n\n\"Well done, Salford!\" Mrs. Seal exclaimed enthusiastically, thumping\nthe teapot which she held upon the table, in token of applause.\n\n\"Yes, these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at last,\"\nsaid Mr. Clacton, and then Mary introduced him to Miss Hilbery, and he\nasked her, in a very formal manner, if she were interested \"in our\nwork.\"\n\n\"And the proofs still not come?\" said Mrs. Seal, putting both her\nelbows on the table, and propping her chin on her hands, as Mary began\nto pour out tea. \"It s too bad too bad. At this rate we shall miss the\ncountry post. Which reminds me, Mr. Clacton, don t you think we should\ncircularize the provinces with Partridge s last speech? What? You ve\nnot read it? Oh, it s the best thing they ve had in the House this\nSession. Even the Prime Minister \"\n\nBut Mary cut her short.\n\n\"We don t allow shop at tea, Sally,\" she said firmly. \"We fine her a\npenny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying a plum cake,\"\nshe explained, seeking to draw Katharine into the community. She had\ngiven up all hope of impressing her.\n\n\"I m sorry, I m sorry,\" Mrs. Seal apologized. \"It s my misfortune to be\nan enthusiast,\" she said, turning to Katharine. \"My father s daughter\ncould hardly be anything else. I think I ve been on as many committees\nas most people. Waifs and Strays, Rescue Work, Church Work, C. O.\nS. local branch besides the usual civic duties which fall to one as a\nhouseholder. But I ve given them all up for our work here, and I don t\nregret it for a second,\" she added. \"This is the root question, I feel;\nuntil women have votes \"\n\n\"It ll be sixpence, at least, Sally,\" said Mary, bringing her fist down\non the table. \"And we re all sick to death of women and their votes.\"\n\nMrs. Seal looked for a moment as though she could hardly believe her\nears, and made a deprecating \"tut-tut-tut\" in her throat, looking\nalternately at Katharine and Mary, and shaking her head as she did so.\nThen she remarked, rather confidentially to Katharine, with a little\nnod in Mary s direction:\n\n\"She s doing more for the cause than any of us. She s giving her\nyouth for, alas! when I was young there were domestic circumstances \"\nshe sighed, and stopped short.\n\nMr. Clacton hastily reverted to the joke about luncheon, and explained\nhow Mrs. Seal fed on a bag of biscuits under the trees, whatever the\nweather might be, rather, Katharine thought, as though Mrs. Seal were a\npet dog who had convenient tricks.\n\n\"Yes, I took my little bag into the square,\" said Mrs. Seal, with the\nself-conscious guilt of a child owning some fault to its elders. \"It\nwas really very sustaining, and the bare boughs against the sky do one\nso much _good_. But I shall have to give up going into the square,\" she\nproceeded, wrinkling her forehead. \"The injustice of it! Why should I\nhave a beautiful square all to myself, when poor women who need rest\nhave nowhere at all to sit?\" She looked fiercely at Katharine, giving\nher short locks a little shake. \"It s dreadful what a tyrant one still\nis, in spite of all one s efforts. One tries to lead a decent life, but\none can t. Of course, directly one thinks of it, one sees that _all_\nsquares should be open to _every one_. Is there any society with that\nobject, Mr. Clacton? If not, there should be, surely.\"\n\n\"A most excellent object,\" said Mr. Clacton in his professional manner.\n\"At the same time, one must deplore the ramification of organizations,\nMrs. Seal. So much excellent effort thrown away, not to speak of\npounds, shillings, and pence. Now how many organizations of a\nphilanthropic nature do you suppose there are in the City of London\nitself, Miss Hilbery?\" he added, screwing his mouth into a queer little\nsmile, as if to show that the question had its frivolous side.\n\nKatharine smiled, too. Her unlikeness to the rest of them had, by this\ntime, penetrated to Mr. Clacton, who was not naturally observant, and\nhe was wondering who she was; this same unlikeness had subtly\nstimulated Mrs. Seal to try and make a convert of her. Mary, too,\nlooked at her almost as if she begged her to make things easy. For\nKatharine had shown no disposition to make things easy. She had\nscarcely spoken, and her silence, though grave and even thoughtful,\nseemed to Mary the silence of one who criticizes.\n\n\"Well, there are more in this house than I d any notion of,\" she said.\n\"On the ground floor you protect natives, on the next you emigrate\nwomen and tell people to eat nuts \"\n\n\"Why do you say that  we  do these things?\" Mary interposed, rather\nsharply. \"We re not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge\nin the same house with us.\"\n\nMr. Clacton cleared his throat and looked at each of the young ladies\nin turn. He was a good deal struck by the appearance and manner of Miss\nHilbery, which seemed to him to place her among those cultivated and\nluxurious people of whom he used to dream. Mary, on the other hand, was\nmore of his own sort, and a little too much inclined to order him\nabout. He picked up crumbs of dry biscuit and put them into his mouth\nwith incredible rapidity.\n\n\"You don t belong to our society, then?\" said Mrs. Seal.\n\n\"No, I m afraid I don t,\" said Katharine, with such ready candor that\nMrs. Seal was nonplussed, and stared at her with a puzzled expression,\nas if she could not classify her among the varieties of human beings\nknown to her.\n\n\"But surely,\" she began.\n\n\"Mrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters,\" said Mr. Clacton, almost\napologetically. \"We have to remind her sometimes that others have a\nright to their views even if they differ from our own.... \"Punch\" has a\nvery funny picture this week, about a Suffragist and an agricultural\nlaborer. Have you seen this week s \"Punch,\" Miss Datchet?\"\n\nMary laughed, and said \"No.\"\n\nMr. Clacton then told them the substance of the joke, which, however,\ndepended a good deal for its success upon the expression which the\nartist had put into the people s faces. Mrs. Seal sat all the time\nperfectly grave. Directly he had done speaking she burst out:\n\n\"But surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all, you must\nwish them to have the vote?\"\n\n\"I never said I didn t wish them to have the vote,\" Katharine\nprotested.\n\n\"Then why aren t you a member of our society?\" Mrs. Seal demanded.\n\nKatharine stirred her spoon round and round, stared into the swirl of\nthe tea, and remained silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile, framed a question\nwhich, after a moment s hesitation, he put to Katharine.\n\n\"Are you in any way related, I wonder, to the poet Alardyce? His\ndaughter, I believe, married a Mr. Hilbery.\"\n\n\"Yes; I m the poet s granddaughter,\" said Katharine, with a little\nsigh, after a pause; and for a moment they were all silent.\n\n\"The poet s granddaughter!\" Mrs. Seal repeated, half to herself, with a\nshake of her head, as if that explained what was otherwise\ninexplicable.\n\nThe light kindled in Mr. Clacton s eye.\n\n\"Ah, indeed. That interests me very much,\" he said. \"I owe a great debt\nto your grandfather, Miss Hilbery. At one time I could have repeated\nthe greater part of him by heart. But one gets out of the way of\nreading poetry, unfortunately. You don t remember him, I suppose?\"\n\nA sharp rap at the door made Katharine s answer inaudible. Mrs. Seal\nlooked up with renewed hope in her eyes, and exclaiming:\n\n\"The proofs at last!\" ran to open the door. \"Oh, it s only Mr. Denham!\"\nshe cried, without any attempt to conceal her disappointment. Ralph,\nKatharine supposed, was a frequent visitor, for the only person he\nthought it necessary to greet was herself, and Mary at once explained\nthe strange fact of her being there by saying:\n\n\"Katharine has come to see how one runs an office.\"\n\nRalph felt himself stiffen uncomfortably, as he said:\n\n\"I hope Mary hasn t persuaded you that she knows how to run an office?\"\n\n\"What, doesn t she?\" said Katharine, looking from one to the other.\n\nAt these remarks Mrs. Seal began to exhibit signs of discomposure,\nwhich displayed themselves by a tossing movement of her head, and, as\nRalph took a letter from his pocket, and placed his finger upon a\ncertain sentence, she forestalled him by exclaiming in confusion:\n\n\"Now, I know what you re going to say, Mr. Denham! But it was the day\nKit Markham was here, and she upsets one so with her wonderful\nvitality, always thinking of something new that we ought to be doing\nand aren t and I was conscious at the time that my dates were mixed. It\nhad nothing to do with Mary at all, I assure you.\"\n\n\"My dear Sally, don t apologize,\" said Mary, laughing. \"Men are such\npedants they don t know what things matter, and what things don t.\"\n\n\"Now, Denham, speak up for our sex,\" said Mr. Clacton in a jocular\nmanner, indeed, but like most insignificant men he was very quick to\nresent being found fault with by a woman, in argument with whom he was\nfond of calling himself \"a mere man.\" He wished, however, to enter into\na literary conservation with Miss Hilbery, and thus let the matter\ndrop.\n\n\"Doesn t it seem strange to you, Miss Hilbery,\" he said, \"that the\nFrench, with all their wealth of illustrious names, have no poet who\ncan compare with your grandfather? Let me see. There s Chenier and Hugo\nand Alfred de Musset wonderful men, but, at the same time, there s a\nrichness, a freshness about Alardyce \"\n\nHere the telephone bell rang, and he had to absent himself with a smile\nand a bow which signified that, although literature is delightful, it\nis not work. Mrs. Seal rose at the same time, but remained hovering\nover the table, delivering herself of a tirade against party\ngovernment. \"For if I were to tell you what I know of back-stairs\nintrigue, and what can be done by the power of the purse, you wouldn t\ncredit me, Mr. Denham, you wouldn t, indeed. Which is why I feel that\nthe only work for my father s daughter for he was one of the pioneers,\nMr. Denham, and on his tombstone I had that verse from the Psalms put,\nabout the sowers and the seed.... And what wouldn t I give that he\nshould be alive now, seeing what we re going to see \" but reflecting\nthat the glories of the future depended in part upon the activity of\nher typewriter, she bobbed her head, and hurried back to the seclusion\nof her little room, from which immediately issued sounds of\nenthusiastic, but obviously erratic, composition.\n\nMary made it clear at once, by starting a fresh topic of general\ninterest, that though she saw the humor of her colleague, she did not\nintend to have her laughed at.\n\n\"The standard of morality seems to me frightfully low,\" she observed\nreflectively, pouring out a second cup of tea, \"especially among women\nwho aren t well educated. They don t see that small things matter, and\nthat s where the leakage begins, and then we find ourselves in\ndifficulties I very nearly lost my temper yesterday,\" she went on,\nlooking at Ralph with a little smile, as though he knew what happened\nwhen she lost her temper. \"It makes me very angry when people tell me\nlies doesn t it make you angry?\" she asked Katharine.\n\n\"But considering that every one tells lies,\" Katharine remarked,\nlooking about the room to see where she had put down her umbrella and\nher parcel, for there was an intimacy in the way in which Mary and\nRalph addressed each other which made her wish to leave them. Mary, on\nthe other hand, was anxious, superficially at least, that Katharine\nshould stay and so fortify her in her determination not to be in love\nwith Ralph.\n\nRalph, while lifting his cup from his lips to the table, had made up\nhis mind that if Miss Hilbery left, he would go with her.\n\n\"I don t think that I tell lies, and I don t think that Ralph tells\nlies, do you, Ralph?\" Mary continued.\n\nKatharine laughed, with more gayety, as it seemed to Mary, than she\ncould properly account for. What was she laughing at? At them,\npresumably. Katharine had risen, and was glancing hither and thither,\nat the presses and the cupboards, and all the machinery of the office,\nas if she included them all in her rather malicious amusement, which\ncaused Mary to keep her eyes on her straightly and rather fiercely, as\nif she were a gay-plumed, mischievous bird, who might light on the\ntopmost bough and pick off the ruddiest cherry, without any warning.\nTwo women less like each other could scarcely be imagined, Ralph\nthought, looking from one to the other. Next moment, he too, rose, and\nnodding to Mary, as Katharine said good-bye, opened the door for her,\nand followed her out.\n\nMary sat still and made no attempt to prevent them from going. For a\nsecond or two after the door had shut on them her eyes rested on the\ndoor with a straightforward fierceness in which, for a moment, a\ncertain degree of bewilderment seemed to enter; but, after a brief\nhesitation, she put down her cup and proceeded to clear away the\ntea-things.\n\nThe impulse which had driven Ralph to take this action was the result\nof a very swift little piece of reasoning, and thus, perhaps, was not\nquite so much of an impulse as it seemed. It passed through his mind\nthat if he missed this chance of talking to Katharine, he would have to\nface an enraged ghost, when he was alone in his room again, demanding\nan explanation of his cowardly indecision. It was better, on the whole,\nto risk present discomfiture than to waste an evening bandying excuses\nand constructing impossible scenes with this uncompromising section of\nhimself. For ever since he had visited the Hilberys he had been much at\nthe mercy of a phantom Katharine, who came to him when he sat alone,\nand answered him as he would have her answer, and was always beside him\nto crown those varying triumphs which were transacted almost every\nnight, in imaginary scenes, as he walked through the lamplit streets\nhome from the office. To walk with Katharine in the flesh would either\nfeed that phantom with fresh food, which, as all who nourish dreams are\naware, is a process that becomes necessary from time to time, or refine\nit to such a degree of thinness that it was scarcely serviceable any\nlonger; and that, too, is sometimes a welcome change to a dreamer. And\nall the time Ralph was well aware that the bulk of Katharine was not\nrepresented in his dreams at all, so that when he met her he was\nbewildered by the fact that she had nothing to do with his dream of\nher.\n\nWhen, on reaching the street, Katharine found that Mr. Denham proceeded\nto keep pace by her side, she was surprised and, perhaps, a little\nannoyed. She, too, had her margin of imagination, and to-night her\nactivity in this obscure region of the mind required solitude. If she\nhad had her way, she would have walked very fast down the Tottenham\nCourt Road, and then sprung into a cab and raced swiftly home. The view\nshe had had of the inside of an office was of the nature of a dream to\nher. Shut off up there, she compared Mrs. Seal, and Mary Datchet, and\nMr. Clacton to enchanted people in a bewitched tower, with the spiders \nwebs looping across the corners of the room, and all the tools of the\nnecromancer s craft at hand; for so aloof and unreal and apart from the\nnormal world did they seem to her, in the house of innumerable\ntypewriters, murmuring their incantations and concocting their drugs,\nand flinging their frail spiders  webs over the torrent of life which\nrushed down the streets outside.\n\nShe may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration in this\nfancy of hers, for she certainly did not wish to share it with Ralph.\nTo him, she supposed, Mary Datchet, composing leaflets for Cabinet\nMinisters among her typewriters, represented all that was interesting\nand genuine; and, accordingly, she shut them both out from all share in\nthe crowded street, with its pendant necklace of lamps, its lighted\nwindows, and its throng of men and women, which exhilarated her to such\nan extent that she very nearly forgot her companion. She walked very\nfast, and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was to\nproduce a queer dizziness both in her head and in Ralph s, which set\ntheir bodies far apart. But she did her duty by her companion almost\nunconsciously.\n\n\"Mary Datchet does that sort of work very well.... She s responsible\nfor it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes. The others don t help at all.... Has she made a convert of you?\"\n\n\"Oh no. That is, I m a convert already.\"\n\n\"But she hasn t persuaded you to work for them?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no that wouldn t do at all.\"\n\nSo they walked on down the Tottenham Court Road, parting and coming\ntogether again, and Ralph felt much as though he were addressing the\nsummit of a poplar in a high gale of wind.\n\n\"Suppose we get on to that omnibus?\" he suggested.\n\nKatharine acquiesced, and they climbed up, and found themselves alone\non top of it.\n\n\"But which way are you going?\" Katharine asked, waking a little from\nthe trance into which movement among moving things had thrown her.\n\n\"I m going to the Temple,\" Ralph replied, inventing a destination on\nthe spur of the moment. He felt the change come over her as they sat\ndown and the omnibus began to move forward. He imagined her\ncontemplating the avenue in front of them with those honest sad eyes\nwhich seemed to set him at such a distance from them. But the breeze\nwas blowing in their faces; it lifted her hat for a second, and she\ndrew out a pin and stuck it in again, a little action which seemed, for\nsome reason, to make her rather more fallible. Ah, if only her hat\nwould blow off, and leave her altogether disheveled, accepting it from\nhis hands!\n\n\"This is like Venice,\" she observed, raising her hand. \"The motor-cars,\nI mean, shooting about so quickly, with their lights.\"\n\n\"I ve never seen Venice,\" he replied. \"I keep that and some other\nthings for my old age.\"\n\n\"What are the other things?\" she asked.\n\n\"There s Venice and India and, I think, Dante, too.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Think of providing for one s old age! And would you refuse to see\nVenice if you had the chance?\"\n\nInstead of answering her, he wondered whether he should tell her\nsomething that was quite true about himself; and as he wondered, he\ntold her.\n\n\"I ve planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child, to make\nit last longer. You see, I m always afraid that I m missing something \"\n\n\"And so am I!\" Katharine exclaimed. \"But, after all,\" she added, \"why\nshould you miss anything?\"\n\n\"Why? Because I m poor, for one thing,\" Ralph rejoined. \"You, I\nsuppose, can have Venice and India and Dante every day of your life.\"\n\nShe said nothing for a moment, but rested one hand, which was bare of\nglove, upon the rail in front of her, meditating upon a variety of\nthings, of which one was that this strange young man pronounced Dante\nas she was used to hearing it pronounced, and another, that he had,\nmost unexpectedly, a feeling about life that was familiar to her.\nPerhaps, then, he was the sort of person she might take an interest in,\nif she came to know him better, and as she had placed him among those\nwhom she would never want to know better, this was enough to make her\nsilent. She hastily recalled her first view of him, in the little room\nwhere the relics were kept, and ran a bar through half her impressions,\nas one cancels a badly written sentence, having found the right one.\n\n\"But to know that one might have things doesn t alter the fact that one\nhasn t got them,\" she said, in some confusion. \"How could I go to\nIndia, for example? Besides,\" she began impulsively, and stopped\nherself. Here the conductor came round, and interrupted them. Ralph\nwaited for her to resume her sentence, but she said no more.\n\n\"I have a message to give your father,\" he remarked. \"Perhaps you would\ngive it him, or I could come \"\n\n\"Yes, do come,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"Still, I don t see why you shouldn t go to India,\" Ralph began, in\norder to keep her from rising, as she threatened to do.\n\nBut she got up in spite of him, and said good-bye with her usual air of\ndecision, and left him with a quickness which Ralph connected now with\nall her movements. He looked down and saw her standing on the pavement\nedge, an alert, commanding figure, which waited its season to cross,\nand then walked boldly and swiftly to the other side. That gesture and\naction would be added to the picture he had of her, but at present the\nreal woman completely routed the phantom one.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII\n\n\n\"And little Augustus Pelham said to me,  It s the younger generation\nknocking at the door,  and I said to him,  Oh, but the younger\ngeneration comes in without knocking, Mr. Pelham.  Such a feeble little\njoke, wasn t it, but down it went into his notebook all the same.\"\n\n\"Let us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave before\nthat work is published,\" said Mr. Hilbery.\n\nThe elderly couple were waiting for the dinner-bell to ring and for\ntheir daughter to come into the room. Their arm-chairs were drawn up on\neither side of the fire, and each sat in the same slightly crouched\nposition, looking into the coals, with the expressions of people who\nhave had their share of experiences and wait, rather passively, for\nsomething to happen. Mr. Hilbery now gave all his attention to a piece\nof coal which had fallen out of the grate, and to selecting a favorable\nposition for it among the lumps that were burning already. Mrs. Hilbery\nwatched him in silence, and the smile changed on her lips as if her\nmind still played with the events of the afternoon.\n\nWhen Mr. Hilbery had accomplished his task, he resumed his crouching\nposition again, and began to toy with the little green stone attached\nto his watch-chain. His deep, oval-shaped eyes were fixed upon the\nflames, but behind the superficial glaze seemed to brood an observant\nand whimsical spirit, which kept the brown of the eye still unusually\nvivid. But a look of indolence, the result of skepticism or of a taste\ntoo fastidious to be satisfied by the prizes and conclusions so easily\nwithin his grasp, lent him an expression almost of melancholy. After\nsitting thus for a time, he seemed to reach some point in his thinking\nwhich demonstrated its futility, upon which he sighed and stretched his\nhand for a book lying on the table by his side.\n\nDirectly the door opened he closed the book, and the eyes of father and\nmother both rested on Katharine as she came towards them. The sight\nseemed at once to give them a motive which they had not had before. To\nthem she appeared, as she walked towards them in her light evening\ndress, extremely young, and the sight of her refreshed them, were it\nonly because her youth and ignorance made their knowledge of the world\nof some value.\n\n\"The only excuse for you, Katharine, is that dinner is still later than\nyou are,\" said Mr. Hilbery, putting down his spectacles.\n\n\"I don t mind her being late when the result is so charming,\" said Mrs.\nHilbery, looking with pride at her daughter. \"Still, I don t know that\nI _like_ your being out so late, Katharine,\" she continued. \"You took a\ncab, I hope?\"\n\nHere dinner was announced, and Mr. Hilbery formally led his wife\ndownstairs on his arm. They were all dressed for dinner, and, indeed,\nthe prettiness of the dinner-table merited that compliment. There was\nno cloth upon the table, and the china made regular circles of deep\nblue upon the shining brown wood. In the middle there was a bowl of\ntawny red and yellow chrysanthemums, and one of pure white, so fresh\nthat the narrow petals were curved backwards into a firm white ball.\nFrom the surrounding walls the heads of three famous Victorian writers\nsurveyed this entertainment, and slips of paper pasted beneath them\ntestified in the great man s own handwriting that he was yours\nsincerely or affectionately or for ever. The father and daughter would\nhave been quite content, apparently, to eat their dinner in silence, or\nwith a few cryptic remarks expressed in a shorthand which could not be\nunderstood by the servants. But silence depressed Mrs. Hilbery, and far\nfrom minding the presence of maids, she would often address herself to\nthem, and was never altogether unconscious of their approval or\ndisapproval of her remarks. In the first place she called them to\nwitness that the room was darker than usual, and had all the lights\nturned on.\n\n\"That s more cheerful,\" she exclaimed. \"D you know, Katharine, that\nridiculous goose came to tea with me? Oh, how I wanted you! He tried to\nmake epigrams all the time, and I got so nervous, expecting them, you\nknow, that I spilt the tea and he made an epigram about that!\"\n\n\"Which ridiculous goose?\" Katharine asked her father.\n\n\"Only one of my geese, happily, makes epigrams Augustus Pelham, of\ncourse,\" said Mrs. Hilbery.\n\n\"I m not sorry that I was out,\" said Katharine.\n\n\"Poor Augustus!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. \"But we re all too hard on\nhim. Remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother.\"\n\n\"That s only because she is his mother. Any one connected with\nhimself \"\n\n\"No, no, Katharine that s too bad. That s what s the word I mean,\nTrevor, something long and Latin the sort of word you and Katharine\nknow \"\n\nMr. Hilbery suggested \"cynical.\"\n\n\"Well, that ll do. I don t believe in sending girls to college, but I\nshould teach them that sort of thing. It makes one feel so dignified,\nbringing out these little allusions, and passing on gracefully to the\nnext topic. But I don t know what s come over me I actually had to ask\nAugustus the name of the lady Hamlet was in love with, as you were out,\nKatharine, and Heaven knows what he mayn t put down about me in his\ndiary.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Katharine started, with great impetuosity, and checked\nherself. Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly, and\nthen she remembered that her father was there, listening with\nattention.\n\n\"What is it you wish?\" he asked, as she paused.\n\nHe often surprised her, thus, into telling him what she had not meant\nto tell him; and then they argued, while Mrs. Hilbery went on with her\nown thoughts.\n\n\"I wish mother wasn t famous. I was out at tea, and they would talk to\nme about poetry.\"\n\n\"Thinking you must be poetical, I see and aren t you?\"\n\n\"Who s been talking to you about poetry, Katharine?\" Mrs. Hilbery\ndemanded, and Katharine was committed to giving her parents an account\nof her visit to the Suffrage office.\n\n\"They have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell\nSquare. I never saw such queer-looking people. And the man discovered I\nwas related to the poet, and talked to me about poetry. Even Mary\nDatchet seems different in that atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Yes, the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul,\" said Mr.\nHilbery.\n\n\"I don t remember any offices in Russell Square in the old days, when\nMamma lived there,\" Mrs. Hilbery mused, \"and I can t fancy turning one\nof those noble great rooms into a stuffy little Suffrage office. Still,\nif the clerks read poetry there must be something nice about them.\"\n\n\"No, because they don t read it as we read it,\" Katharine insisted.\n\n\"But it s nice to think of them reading your grandfather, and not\nfilling up those dreadful little forms all day long,\" Mrs. Hilbery\npersisted, her notion of office life being derived from some chance\nview of a scene behind the counter at her bank, as she slipped the\nsovereigns into her purse.\n\n\"At any rate, they haven t made a convert of Katharine, which was what\nI was afraid of,\" Mr. Hilbery remarked.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Katharine very decidedly, \"I wouldn t work with them for\nanything.\"\n\n\"It s curious,\" Mr. Hilbery continued, agreeing with his daughter, \"how\nthe sight of one s fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off. They show\nup the faults of one s cause so much more plainly than one s\nantagonists. One can be enthusiastic in one s study, but directly one\ncomes into touch with the people who agree with one, all the glamor\ngoes. So I ve always found,\" and he proceeded to tell them, as he\npeeled his apple, how he committed himself once, in his youthful days,\nto make a speech at a political meeting, and went there ablaze with\nenthusiasm for the ideals of his own side; but while his leaders spoke,\nhe became gradually converted to the other way of thinking, if thinking\nit could be called, and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a\nfool of himself an experience which had sickened him of public\nmeetings.\n\nKatharine listened and felt as she generally did when her father, and\nto some extent her mother, described their feelings, that she quite\nunderstood and agreed with them, but, at the same time, saw something\nwhich they did not see, and always felt some disappointment when they\nfell short of her vision, as they always did. The plates succeeded each\nother swiftly and noiselessly in front of her, and the table was decked\nfor dessert, and as the talk murmured on in familiar grooves, she sat\nthere, rather like a judge, listening to her parents, who did, indeed,\nfeel it very pleasant when they made her laugh.\n\nDaily life in a house where there are young and old is full of curious\nlittle ceremonies and pieties, which are discharged quite punctually,\nthough the meaning of them is obscure, and a mystery has come to brood\nover them which lends even a superstitious charm to their performance.\nSuch was the nightly ceremony of the cigar and the glass of port, which\nwere placed on the right hand and on the left hand of Mr. Hilbery, and\nsimultaneously Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine left the room. All the years\nthey had lived together they had never seen Mr. Hilbery smoke his cigar\nor drink his port, and they would have felt it unseemly if, by chance,\nthey had surprised him as he sat there. These short, but clearly\nmarked, periods of separation between the sexes were always used for an\nintimate postscript to what had been said at dinner, the sense of being\nwomen together coming out most strongly when the male sex was, as if by\nsome religious rite, secluded from the female. Katharine knew by heart\nthe sort of mood that possessed her as she walked upstairs to the\ndrawing-room, her mother s arm in hers; and she could anticipate the\npleasure with which, when she had turned on the lights, they both\nregarded the drawing-room, fresh swept and set in order for the last\nsection of the day, with the red parrots swinging on the chintz\ncurtains, and the arm-chairs warming in the blaze. Mrs. Hilbery stood\nover the fire, with one foot on the fender, and her skirts slightly\nraised.\n\n\"Oh, Katharine,\" she exclaimed, \"how you ve made me think of Mamma and\nthe old days in Russell Square! I can see the chandeliers, and the\ngreen silk of the piano, and Mamma sitting in her cashmere shawl by the\nwindow, singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to\nlisten. Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round\nthe corner. It must have been a summer evening. That was before things\nwere hopeless....\"\n\nAs she spoke an expression of regret, which must have come frequently\nto cause the lines which now grew deep round the lips and eyes, settled\non her face. The poet s marriage had not been a happy one. He had left\nhis wife, and after some years of a rather reckless existence, she had\ndied, before her time. This disaster had led to great irregularities of\neducation, and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery might be said to have escaped\neducation altogether. But she had been her father s companion at the\nseason when he wrote the finest of his poems. She had sat on his knee\nin taverns and other haunts of drunken poets, and it was for her sake,\nso people said, that he had cured himself of his dissipation, and\nbecome the irreproachable literary character that the world knows,\nwhose inspiration had deserted him. As Mrs. Hilbery grew old she\nthought more and more of the past, and this ancient disaster seemed at\ntimes almost to prey upon her mind, as if she could not pass out of\nlife herself without laying the ghost of her parent s sorrow to rest.\n\nKatharine wished to comfort her mother, but it was difficult to do this\nsatisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much of a legend. The\nhouse in Russell Square, for example, with its noble rooms, and the\nmagnolia-tree in the garden, and the sweet-voiced piano, and the sound\nof feet coming down the corridors, and other properties of size and\nromance had they any existence? Yet why should Mrs. Alardyce live all\nalone in this gigantic mansion, and, if she did not live alone, with\nwhom did she live? For its own sake, Katharine rather liked this tragic\nstory, and would have been glad to hear the details of it, and to have\nbeen able to discuss them frankly. But this it became less and less\npossible to do, for though Mrs. Hilbery was constantly reverting to the\nstory, it was always in this tentative and restless fashion, as though\nby a touch here and there she could set things straight which had been\ncrooked these sixty years. Perhaps, indeed, she no longer knew what the\ntruth was.\n\n\"If they d lived now,\" she concluded, \"I feel it wouldn t have\nhappened. People aren t so set upon tragedy as they were then. If my\nfather had been able to go round the world, or if she d had a rest\ncure, everything would have come right. But what could I do? And then\nthey had bad friends, both of them, who made mischief. Ah, Katharine,\nwhen you marry, be quite, quite sure that you love your husband!\"\n\nThe tears stood in Mrs. Hilbery s eyes.\n\nWhile comforting her, Katharine thought to herself, \"Now this is what\nMary Datchet and Mr. Denham don t understand. This is the sort of\nposition I m always getting into. How simple it must be to live as they\ndo!\" for all the evening she had been comparing her home and her father\nand mother with the Suffrage office and the people there.\n\n\"But, Katharine,\" Mrs. Hilbery continued, with one of her sudden\nchanges of mood, \"though, Heaven knows, I don t want to see you\nmarried, surely if ever a man loved a woman, William loves you. And\nit s a nice, rich-sounding name too Katharine Rodney, which,\nunfortunately, doesn t mean that he s got any money, because he\nhasn t.\"\n\nThe alteration of her name annoyed Katharine, and she observed, rather\nsharply, that she didn t want to marry any one.\n\n\"It s very dull that you can only marry one husband, certainly,\" Mrs.\nHilbery reflected. \"I always wish that you could marry everybody who\nwants to marry you. Perhaps they ll come to that in time, but meanwhile\nI confess that dear William \" But here Mr. Hilbery came in, and the\nmore solid part of the evening began. This consisted in the reading\naloud by Katharine from some prose work or other, while her mother\nknitted scarves intermittently on a little circular frame, and her\nfather read the newspaper, not so attentively but that he could comment\nhumorously now and again upon the fortunes of the hero and the heroine.\nThe Hilberys subscribed to a library, which delivered books on Tuesdays\nand Fridays, and Katharine did her best to interest her parents in the\nworks of living and highly respectable authors; but Mrs. Hilbery was\nperturbed by the very look of the light, gold-wreathed volumes, and\nwould make little faces as if she tasted something bitter as the\nreading went on; while Mr. Hilbery would treat the moderns with a\ncurious elaborate banter such as one might apply to the antics of a\npromising child. So this evening, after five pages or so of one of\nthese masters, Mrs. Hilbery protested that it was all too clever and\ncheap and nasty for words.\n\n\"Please, Katharine, read us something _real_.\"\n\nKatharine had to go to the bookcase and choose a portly volume in\nsleek, yellow calf, which had directly a sedative effect upon both her\nparents. But the delivery of the evening post broke in upon the periods\nof Henry Fielding, and Katharine found that her letters needed all her\nattention.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VIII\n\n\nShe took her letters up to her room with her, having persuaded her\nmother to go to bed directly Mr. Hilbery left them, for so long as she\nsat in the same room as her mother, Mrs. Hilbery might, at any moment,\nask for a sight of the post. A very hasty glance through many sheets\nhad shown Katharine that, by some coincidence, her attention had to be\ndirected to many different anxieties simultaneously. In the first\nplace, Rodney had written a very full account of his state of mind,\nwhich was illustrated by a sonnet, and he demanded a reconsideration of\ntheir position, which agitated Katharine more than she liked. Then\nthere were two letters which had to be laid side by side and compared\nbefore she could make out the truth of their story, and even when she\nknew the facts she could not decide what to make of them; and finally\nshe had to reflect upon a great many pages from a cousin who found\nhimself in financial difficulties, which forced him to the uncongenial\noccupation of teaching the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the\nviolin.\n\nBut the two letters which each told the same story differently were the\nchief source of her perplexity. She was really rather shocked to find\nit definitely established that her own second cousin, Cyril Alardyce,\nhad lived for the last four years with a woman who was not his wife,\nwho had borne him two children, and was now about to bear him another.\nThis state of things had been discovered by Mrs. Milvain, her aunt\nCelia, a zealous inquirer into such matters, whose letter was also\nunder consideration. Cyril, she said, must be made to marry the woman\nat once; and Cyril, rightly or wrongly, was indignant with such\ninterference with his affairs, and would not own that he had any cause\nto be ashamed of himself. Had he any cause to be ashamed of himself,\nKatharine wondered; and she turned to her aunt again.\n\n\"Remember,\" she wrote, in her profuse, emphatic statement, \"that he\nbears your grandfather s name, and so will the child that is to be\nborn. The poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman who deluded\nhim, thinking him a gentleman, which he IS, and having money, which he\nhas _not_.\"\n\n\"What would Ralph Denham say to this?\" thought Katharine, beginning to\npace up and down her bedroom. She twitched aside the curtains, so that,\non turning, she was faced by darkness, and looking out, could just\ndistinguish the branches of a plane-tree and the yellow lights of some\none else s windows.\n\n\"What would Mary Datchet and Ralph Denham say?\" she reflected, pausing\nby the window, which, as the night was warm, she raised, in order to\nfeel the air upon her face, and to lose herself in the nothingness of\nnight. But with the air the distant humming sound of far-off crowded\nthoroughfares was admitted to the room. The incessant and tumultuous\nhum of the distant traffic seemed, as she stood there, to represent the\nthick texture of her life, for her life was so hemmed in with the\nprogress of other lives that the sound of its own advance was\ninaudible. People like Ralph and Mary, she thought, had it all their\nown way, and an empty space before them, and, as she envied them, she\ncast her mind out to imagine an empty land where all this petty\nintercourse of men and women, this life made up of the dense crossings\nand entanglements of men and women, had no existence whatever. Even\nnow, alone, at night, looking out into the shapeless mass of London,\nshe was forced to remember that there was one point and here another\nwith which she had some connection. William Rodney, at this very\nmoment, was seated in a minute speck of light somewhere to the east of\nher, and his mind was occupied, not with his book, but with her. She\nwished that no one in the whole world would think of her. However,\nthere was no way of escaping from one s fellow-beings, she concluded,\nand shut the window with a sigh, and returned once more to her letters.\n\nShe could not doubt but that William s letter was the most genuine she\nhad yet received from him. He had come to the conclusion that he could\nnot live without her, he wrote. He believed that he knew her, and could\ngive her happiness, and that their marriage would be unlike other\nmarriages. Nor was the sonnet, in spite of its accomplishment, lacking\nin passion, and Katharine, as she read the pages through again, could\nsee in what direction her feelings ought to flow, supposing they\nrevealed themselves. She would come to feel a humorous sort of\ntenderness for him, a zealous care for his susceptibilities, and, after\nall, she considered, thinking of her father and mother, what is love?\n\nNaturally, with her face, position, and background, she had experience\nof young men who wished to marry her, and made protestations of love,\nbut, perhaps because she did not return the feeling, it remained\nsomething of a pageant to her. Not having experience of it herself, her\nmind had unconsciously occupied itself for some years in dressing up an\nimage of love, and the marriage that was the outcome of love, and the\nman who inspired love, which naturally dwarfed any examples that came\nher way. Easily, and without correction by reason, her imagination made\npictures, superb backgrounds casting a rich though phantom light upon\nthe facts in the foreground. Splendid as the waters that drop with\nresounding thunder from high ledges of rock, and plunge downwards into\nthe blue depths of night, was the presence of love she dreamt, drawing\ninto it every drop of the force of life, and dashing them all asunder\nin the superb catastrophe in which everything was surrendered, and\nnothing might be reclaimed. The man, too, was some magnanimous hero,\nriding a great horse by the shore of the sea. They rode through forests\ntogether, they galloped by the rim of the sea. But waking, she was able\nto contemplate a perfectly loveless marriage, as the thing one did\nactually in real life, for possibly the people who dream thus are those\nwho do the most prosaic things.\n\nAt this moment she was much inclined to sit on into the night, spinning\nher light fabric of thoughts until she tired of their futility, and\nwent to her mathematics; but, as she knew very well, it was necessary\nthat she should see her father before he went to bed. The case of Cyril\nAlardyce must be discussed, her mother s illusions and the rights of\nthe family attended to. Being vague herself as to what all this\namounted to, she had to take counsel with her father. She took her\nletters in her hand and went downstairs. It was past eleven, and the\nclocks had come into their reign, the grandfather s clock in the hall\nticking in competition with the small clock on the landing. Mr.\nHilbery s study ran out behind the rest of the house, on the ground\nfloor, and was a very silent, subterranean place, the sun in daytime\ncasting a mere abstract of light through a skylight upon his books and\nthe large table, with its spread of white papers, now illumined by a\ngreen reading-lamp. Here Mr. Hilbery sat editing his review, or placing\ntogether documents by means of which it could be proved that Shelley\nhad written \"of\" instead of \"and,\" or that the inn in which Byron had\nslept was called the \"Nag s Head\" and not the \"Turkish Knight,\" or that\nthe Christian name of Keats s uncle had been John rather than Richard,\nfor he knew more minute details about these poets than any man in\nEngland, probably, and was preparing an edition of Shelley which\nscrupulously observed the poet s system of punctuation. He saw the\nhumor of these researches, but that did not prevent him from carrying\nthem out with the utmost scrupulosity.\n\nHe was lying back comfortably in a deep arm-chair smoking a cigar, and\nruminating the fruitful question as to whether Coleridge had wished to\nmarry Dorothy Wordsworth, and what, if he had done so, would have been\nthe consequences to him in particular, and to literature in general.\nWhen Katharine came in he reflected that he knew what she had come for,\nand he made a pencil note before he spoke to her. Having done this, he\nsaw that she was reading, and he watched her for a moment without\nsaying anything. She was reading \"Isabella and the Pot of Basil,\" and\nher mind was full of the Italian hills and the blue daylight, and the\nhedges set with little rosettes of red and white roses. Feeling that\nher father waited for her, she sighed and said, shutting her book:\n\n\"I ve had a letter from Aunt Celia about Cyril, father.... It seems to\nbe true about his marriage. What are we to do?\"\n\n\"Cyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner,\" said Mr.\nHilbery, in his pleasant and deliberate tones.\n\nKatharine found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation, while\nher father balanced his finger-tips so judiciously, and seemed to\nreserve so many of his thoughts for himself.\n\n\"He s about done for himself, I should say,\" he continued. Without\nsaying anything, he took Katharine s letters out of her hand, adjusted\nhis eyeglasses, and read them through.\n\nAt length he said \"Humph!\" and gave the letters back to her.\n\n\"Mother knows nothing about it,\" Katharine remarked. \"Will you tell\nher?\"\n\n\"I shall tell your mother. But I shall tell her that there is nothing\nwhatever for us to do.\"\n\n\"But the marriage?\" Katharine asked, with some diffidence.\n\nMr. Hilbery said nothing, and stared into the fire.\n\n\"What in the name of conscience did he do it for?\" he speculated at\nlast, rather to himself than to her.\n\nKatharine had begun to read her aunt s letter over again, and she now\nquoted a sentence. \"Ibsen and Butler.... He has sent me a letter full\nof quotations nonsense, though clever nonsense.\"\n\n\"Well, if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those\nlines, it s none of our affair,\" he remarked.\n\n\"But isn t it our affair, perhaps, to make them get married?\" Katharine\nasked rather wearily.\n\n\"Why the dickens should they apply to me?\" her father demanded with\nsudden irritation.\n\n\"Only as the head of the family \"\n\n\"But I m not the head of the family. Alfred s the head of the family.\nLet them apply to Alfred,\" said Mr. Hilbery, relapsing again into his\narm-chair. Katharine was aware that she had touched a sensitive spot,\nhowever, in mentioning the family.\n\n\"I think, perhaps, the best thing would be for me to go and see them,\"\nshe observed.\n\n\"I won t have you going anywhere near them,\" Mr. Hilbery replied with\nunwonted decision and authority. \"Indeed, I don t understand why\nthey ve dragged you into the business at all I don t see that it s got\nanything to do with you.\"\n\n\"I ve always been friends with Cyril,\" Katharine observed.\n\n\"But did he ever tell you anything about this?\" Mr. Hilbery asked\nrather sharply.\n\nKatharine shook her head. She was, indeed, a good deal hurt that Cyril\nhad not confided in her did he think, as Ralph Denham or Mary Datchet\nmight think, that she was, for some reason, unsympathetic hostile even?\n\n\"As to your mother,\" said Mr. Hilbery, after a pause, in which he\nseemed to be considering the color of the flames, \"you had better tell\nher the facts. She d better know the facts before every one begins to\ntalk about it, though why Aunt Celia thinks it necessary to come, I m\nsure I don t know. And the less talk there is the better.\"\n\nGranting the assumption that gentlemen of sixty who are highly\ncultivated, and have had much experience of life, probably think of\nmany things which they do not say, Katharine could not help feeling\nrather puzzled by her father s attitude, as she went back to her room.\nWhat a distance he was from it all! How superficially he smoothed these\nevents into a semblance of decency which harmonized with his own view\nof life! He never wondered what Cyril had felt, nor did the hidden\naspects of the case tempt him to examine into them. He merely seemed to\nrealize, rather languidly, that Cyril had behaved in a way which was\nfoolish, because other people did not behave in that way. He seemed to\nbe looking through a telescope at little figures hundreds of miles in\nthe distance.\n\nHer selfish anxiety not to have to tell Mrs. Hilbery what had happened\nmade her follow her father into the hall after breakfast the next\nmorning in order to question him.\n\n\"Have you told mother?\" she asked. Her manner to her father was almost\nstern, and she seemed to hold endless depths of reflection in the dark\nof her eyes.\n\nMr. Hilbery sighed.\n\n\"My dear child, it went out of my head.\" He smoothed his silk hat\nenergetically, and at once affected an air of hurry. \"I ll send a note\nround from the office.... I m late this morning, and I ve any amount of\nproofs to get through.\"\n\n\"That wouldn t do at all,\" Katharine said decidedly. \"She must be\ntold you or I must tell her. We ought to have told her at first.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery had now placed his hat on his head, and his hand was on the\ndoor-knob. An expression which Katharine knew well from her childhood,\nwhen he asked her to shield him in some neglect of duty, came into his\neyes; malice, humor, and irresponsibility were blended in it. He nodded\nhis head to and fro significantly, opened the door with an adroit\nmovement, and stepped out with a lightness unexpected at his age. He\nwaved his hand once to his daughter, and was gone. Left alone,\nKatharine could not help laughing to find herself cheated as usual in\ndomestic bargainings with her father, and left to do the disagreeable\nwork which belonged, by rights, to him.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IX\n\n\nKatharine disliked telling her mother about Cyril s misbehavior quite\nas much as her father did, and for much the same reasons. They both\nshrank, nervously, as people fear the report of a gun on the stage,\nfrom all that would have to be said on this occasion. Katharine,\nmoreover, was unable to decide what she thought of Cyril s misbehavior.\nAs usual, she saw something which her father and mother did not see,\nand the effect of that something was to suspend Cyril s behavior in her\nmind without any qualification at all. They would think whether it was\ngood or bad; to her it was merely a thing that had happened.\n\nWhen Katharine reached the study, Mrs. Hilbery had already dipped her\npen in the ink.\n\n\"Katharine,\" she said, lifting it in the air, \"I ve just made out such\na queer, strange thing about your grandfather. I m three years and six\nmonths older than he was when he died. I couldn t very well have been\nhis mother, but I might have been his elder sister, and that seems to\nme such a pleasant fancy. I m going to start quite fresh this morning,\nand get a lot done.\"\n\nShe began her sentence, at any rate, and Katharine sat down at her own\ntable, untied the bundle of old letters upon which she was working,\nsmoothed them out absent-mindedly, and began to decipher the faded\nscript. In a minute she looked across at her mother, to judge her mood.\nPeace and happiness had relaxed every muscle in her face; her lips were\nparted very slightly, and her breath came in smooth, controlled\ninspirations like those of a child who is surrounding itself with a\nbuilding of bricks, and increasing in ecstasy as each brick is placed\nin position. So Mrs. Hilbery was raising round her the skies and trees\nof the past with every stroke of her pen, and recalling the voices of\nthe dead. Quiet as the room was, and undisturbed by the sounds of the\npresent moment, Katharine could fancy that here was a deep pool of past\ntime, and that she and her mother were bathed in the light of sixty\nyears ago. What could the present give, she wondered, to compare with\nthe rich crowd of gifts bestowed by the past? Here was a Thursday\nmorning in process of manufacture; each second was minted fresh by the\nclock upon the mantelpiece. She strained her ears and could just hear,\nfar off, the hoot of a motor-car and the rush of wheels coming nearer\nand dying away again, and the voices of men crying old iron and\nvegetables in one of the poorer streets at the back of the house.\nRooms, of course, accumulate their suggestions, and any room in which\none has been used to carry on any particular occupation gives off\nmemories of moods, of ideas, of postures that have been seen in it; so\nthat to attempt any different kind of work there is almost impossible.\n\nKatharine was unconsciously affected, each time she entered her\nmother s room, by all these influences, which had had their birth years\nago, when she was a child, and had something sweet and solemn about\nthem, and connected themselves with early memories of the cavernous\nglooms and sonorous echoes of the Abbey where her grandfather lay\nburied. All the books and pictures, even the chairs and tables, had\nbelonged to him, or had reference to him; even the china dogs on the\nmantelpiece and the little shepherdesses with their sheep had been\nbought by him for a penny a piece from a man who used to stand with a\ntray of toys in Kensington High Street, as Katharine had often heard\nher mother tell. Often she had sat in this room, with her mind fixed so\nfirmly on those vanished figures that she could almost see the muscles\nround their eyes and lips, and had given to each his own voice, with\nits tricks of accent, and his coat and his cravat. Often she had seemed\nto herself to be moving among them, an invisible ghost among the\nliving, better acquainted with them than with her own friends, because\nshe knew their secrets and possessed a divine foreknowledge of their\ndestiny. They had been so unhappy, such muddlers, so wrong-headed, it\nseemed to her. She could have told them what to do, and what not to do.\nIt was a melancholy fact that they would pay no heed to her, and were\nbound to come to grief in their own antiquated way. Their behavior was\noften grotesquely irrational; their conventions monstrously absurd; and\nyet, as she brooded upon them, she felt so closely attached to them\nthat it was useless to try to pass judgment upon them. She very nearly\nlost consciousness that she was a separate being, with a future of her\nown. On a morning of slight depression, such as this, she would try to\nfind some sort of clue to the muddle which their old letters presented;\nsome reason which seemed to make it worth while to them; some aim which\nthey kept steadily in view but she was interrupted.\n\nMrs. Hilbery had risen from her table, and was standing looking out of\nthe window at a string of barges swimming up the river.\n\nKatharine watched her. Suddenly Mrs. Hilbery turned abruptly, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"I really believe I m bewitched! I only want three sentences, you see,\nsomething quite straightforward and commonplace, and I can t find  em.\"\n\nShe began to pace up and down the room, snatching up her duster; but\nshe was too much annoyed to find any relief, as yet, in polishing the\nbacks of books.\n\n\"Besides,\" she said, giving the sheet she had written to Katharine, \"I\ndon t believe this ll do. Did your grandfather ever visit the Hebrides,\nKatharine?\" She looked in a strangely beseeching way at her daughter.\n\"My mind got running on the Hebrides, and I couldn t help writing a\nlittle description of them. Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a\nchapter. Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go\non, you know.\" Katharine read what her mother had written. She might\nhave been a schoolmaster criticizing a child s essay. Her face gave\nMrs. Hilbery, who watched it anxiously, no ground for hope.\n\n\"It s very beautiful,\" she stated, \"but, you see, mother, we ought to\ngo from point to point \"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. \"And that s just what I can t do.\nThings keep coming into my head. It isn t that I don t know everything\nand feel everything (who did know him, if I didn t?), but I can t put\nit down, you see. There s a kind of blind spot,\" she said, touching her\nforehead, \"there. And when I can t sleep o  nights, I fancy I shall die\nwithout having done it.\"\n\nFrom exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the\nimagination of her death aroused. The depression communicated itself to\nKatharine. How impotent they were, fiddling about all day long with\npapers! And the clock was striking eleven and nothing done! She watched\nher mother, now rummaging in a great brass-bound box which stood by her\ntable, but she did not go to her help. Of course, Katharine reflected,\nher mother had now lost some paper, and they would waste the rest of\nthe morning looking for it. She cast her eyes down in irritation, and\nread again her mother s musical sentences about the silver gulls, and\nthe roots of little pink flowers washed by pellucid streams, and the\nblue mists of hyacinths, until she was struck by her mother s silence.\nShe raised her eyes. Mrs. Hilbery had emptied a portfolio containing\nold photographs over her table, and was looking from one to another.\n\n\"Surely, Katharine,\" she said, \"the men were far handsomer in those\ndays than they are now, in spite of their odious whiskers? Look at old\nJohn Graham, in his white waistcoat look at Uncle Harley. That s Peter\nthe manservant, I suppose. Uncle John brought him back from India.\"\n\nKatharine looked at her mother, but did not stir or answer. She had\nsuddenly become very angry, with a rage which their relationship made\nsilent, and therefore doubly powerful and critical. She felt all the\nunfairness of the claim which her mother tacitly made to her time and\nsympathy, and what Mrs. Hilbery took, Katharine thought bitterly, she\nwasted. Then, in a flash, she remembered that she had still to tell her\nabout Cyril s misbehavior. Her anger immediately dissipated itself; it\nbroke like some wave that has gathered itself high above the rest; the\nwaters were resumed into the sea again, and Katharine felt once more\nfull of peace and solicitude, and anxious only that her mother should\nbe protected from pain. She crossed the room instinctively, and sat on\nthe arm of her mother s chair. Mrs. Hilbery leant her head against her\ndaughter s body.\n\n\"What is nobler,\" she mused, turning over the photographs, \"than to be\na woman to whom every one turns, in sorrow or difficulty? How have the\nyoung women of your generation improved upon that, Katharine? I can see\nthem now, sweeping over the lawns at Melbury House, in their flounces\nand furbelows, so calm and stately and imperial (and the monkey and the\nlittle black dwarf following behind), as if nothing mattered in the\nworld but to be beautiful and kind. But they did more than we do, I\nsometimes think. They WERE, and that s better than doing. They seem to\nme like ships, like majestic ships, holding on their way, not shoving\nor pushing, not fretted by little things, as we are, but taking their\nway, like ships with white sails.\"\n\nKatharine tried to interrupt this discourse, but the opportunity did\nnot come, and she could not forbear to turn over the pages of the album\nin which the old photographs were stored. The faces of these men and\nwomen shone forth wonderfully after the hubbub of living faces, and\nseemed, as her mother had said, to wear a marvelous dignity and calm,\nas if they had ruled their kingdoms justly and deserved great love.\nSome were of almost incredible beauty, others were ugly enough in a\nforcible way, but none were dull or bored or insignificant. The superb\nstiff folds of the crinolines suited the women; the cloaks and hats of\nthe gentlemen seemed full of character. Once more Katharine felt the\nserene air all round her, and seemed far off to hear the solemn beating\nof the sea upon the shore. But she knew that she must join the present\non to this past.\n\nMrs. Hilbery was rambling on, from story to story.\n\n\"That s Janie Mannering,\" she said, pointing to a superb, white-haired\ndame, whose satin robes seemed strung with pearls. \"I must have told\nyou how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the\nEmpress was coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she\nalways dressed like an Empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and\nappeared in the drawing-room as if she d been sleeping on a bank of\nroses all day. She could do anything with her hands they all could make\na cottage or embroider a petticoat.\"\n\n\"And that s Queenie Colquhoun,\" she went on, turning the pages, \"who\ntook her coffin out with her to Jamaica, packed with lovely shawls and\nbonnets, because you couldn t get coffins in Jamaica, and she had a\nhorror of dying there (as she did), and being devoured by the white\nants. And there s Sabine, the loveliest of them all; ah! it was like a\nstar rising when she came into the room. And that s Miriam, in her\ncoachman s cloak, with all the little capes on, and she wore great\ntop-boots underneath. You young people may say you re unconventional,\nbut you re nothing compared with her.\"\n\nTurning the page, she came upon the picture of a very masculine,\nhandsome lady, whose head the photographer had adorned with an imperial\ncrown.\n\n\"Ah, you wretch!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed, \"what a wicked old despot you\nwere, in your day! How we all bowed down before you!  Maggie,  she used\nto say,  if it hadn t been for me, where would you be now?  And it was\ntrue; she brought them together, you know. She said to my father,\n Marry her,  and he did; and she said to poor little Clara,  Fall down\nand worship him,  and she did; but she got up again, of course. What\nelse could one expect? She was a mere child eighteen and half dead with\nfright, too. But that old tyrant never repented. She used to say that\nshe had given them three perfect months, and no one had a right to\nmore; and I sometimes think, Katharine, that s true, you know. It s\nmore than most of us have, only we have to pretend, which was a thing\nneither of them could ever do. I fancy,\" Mrs. Hilbery mused, \"that\nthere was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women\nwhich, with all your outspokenness, you haven t got.\"\n\nKatharine again tried to interrupt. But Mrs. Hilbery had been gathering\nimpetus from her recollections, and was now in high spirits.\n\n\"They must have been good friends at heart,\" she resumed, \"because she\nused to sing his songs. Ah, how did it go?\" and Mrs. Hilbery, who had a\nvery sweet voice, trolled out a famous lyric of her father s which had\nbeen set to an absurdly and charmingly sentimental air by some early\nVictorian composer.\n\n\"It s the vitality of them!\" she concluded, striking her fist against\nthe table. \"That s what we haven t got! We re virtuous, we re earnest,\nwe go to meetings, we pay the poor their wages, but we don t live as\nthey lived. As often as not, my father wasn t in bed three nights out\nof the seven, but always fresh as paint in the morning. I hear him now,\ncome singing up the stairs to the nursery, and tossing the loaf for\nbreakfast on his sword-stick, and then off we went for a day s\npleasuring Richmond, Hampton Court, the Surrey Hills. Why shouldn t we\ngo, Katharine? It s going to be a fine day.\"\n\nAt this moment, just as Mrs. Hilbery was examining the weather from the\nwindow, there was a knock at the door. A slight, elderly lady came in,\nand was saluted by Katharine, with very evident dismay, as \"Aunt\nCelia!\" She was dismayed because she guessed why Aunt Celia had come.\nIt was certainly in order to discuss the case of Cyril and the woman\nwho was not his wife, and owing to her procrastination Mrs. Hilbery was\nquite unprepared. Who could be more unprepared? Here she was,\nsuggesting that all three of them should go on a jaunt to Blackfriars\nto inspect the site of Shakespeare s theater, for the weather was\nhardly settled enough for the country.\n\nTo this proposal Mrs. Milvain listened with a patient smile, which\nindicated that for many years she had accepted such eccentricities in\nher sister-in-law with bland philosophy. Katharine took up her position\nat some distance, standing with her foot on the fender, as though by so\ndoing she could get a better view of the matter. But, in spite of her\naunt s presence, how unreal the whole question of Cyril and his\nmorality appeared! The difficulty, it now seemed, was not to break the\nnews gently to Mrs. Hilbery, but to make her understand it. How was one\nto lasso her mind, and tether it to this minute, unimportant spot? A\nmatter-of-fact statement seemed best.\n\n\"I think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril, mother,\" she said\nrather brutally. \"Aunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married. He\nhas a wife and children.\"\n\n\"No, he is _not_ married,\" Mrs. Milvain interposed, in low tones,\naddressing herself to Mrs. Hilbery. \"He has two children, and another\non the way.\"\n\nMrs. Hilbery looked from one to the other in bewilderment.\n\n\"We thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you,\"\nKatharine added.\n\n\"But I met Cyril only a fortnight ago at the National Gallery!\" Mrs.\nHilbery exclaimed. \"I don t believe a word of it,\" and she tossed her\nhead with a smile on her lips at Mrs. Milvain, as though she could\nquite understand her mistake, which was a very natural mistake, in the\ncase of a childless woman, whose husband was something very dull in the\nBoard of Trade.\n\n\"I didn t _wish_ to believe it, Maggie,\" said Mrs. Milvain. \"For a long\ntime I _couldn t_ believe it. But now I ve seen, and I _have_ to\nbelieve it.\"\n\n\"Katharine,\" Mrs. Hilbery demanded, \"does your father know of this?\"\n\nKatharine nodded.\n\n\"Cyril married!\" Mrs. Hilbery repeated. \"And never telling us a word,\nthough we ve had him in our house since he was a child noble William s\nson! I can t believe my ears!\"\n\nFeeling that the burden of proof was laid upon her, Mrs. Milvain now\nproceeded with her story. She was elderly and fragile, but her\nchildlessness seemed always to impose these painful duties on her, and\nto revere the family, and to keep it in repair, had now become the\nchief object of her life. She told her story in a low, spasmodic, and\nsomewhat broken voice.\n\n\"I have suspected for some time that he was not happy. There were new\nlines on his face. So I went to his rooms, when I knew he was engaged\nat the poor men s college. He lectures there Roman law, you know, or it\nmay be Greek. The landlady said Mr. Alardyce only slept there about\nonce a fortnight now. He looked so ill, she said. She had seen him with\na young person. I suspected something directly. I went to his room, and\nthere was an envelope on the mantelpiece, and a letter with an address\nin Seton Street, off the Kennington Road.\"\n\nMrs. Hilbery fidgeted rather restlessly, and hummed fragments of her\ntune, as if to interrupt.\n\n\"I went to Seton Street,\" Aunt Celia continued firmly. \"A very low\nplace lodging-houses, you know, with canaries in the window. Number\nseven just like all the others. I rang, I knocked; no one came. I went\ndown the area. I am certain I saw some one inside children a cradle.\nBut no reply no reply.\" She sighed, and looked straight in front of her\nwith a glazed expression in her half-veiled blue eyes.\n\n\"I stood in the street,\" she resumed, \"in case I could catch a sight of\none of them. It seemed a very long time. There were rough men singing\nin the public-house round the corner. At last the door opened, and some\none it must have been the woman herself came right past me. There was\nonly the pillar-box between us.\"\n\n\"And what did she look like?\" Mrs. Hilbery demanded.\n\n\"One could see how the poor boy had been deluded,\" was all that Mrs.\nMilvain vouchsafed by way of description.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed.\n\n\"Poor Cyril!\" Mrs. Milvain said, laying a slight emphasis upon Cyril.\n\n\"But they ve got nothing to live upon,\" Mrs. Hilbery continued. \"If\nhe d come to us like a man,\" she went on, \"and said,  I ve been a\nfool,  one would have pitied him; one would have tried to help him.\nThere s nothing so disgraceful after all But he s been going about all\nthese years, pretending, letting one take it for granted, that he was\nsingle. And the poor deserted little wife \"\n\n\"She is _not_ his wife,\" Aunt Celia interrupted.\n\n\"I ve never heard anything so detestable!\" Mrs. Hilbery wound up,\nstriking her fist on the arm of her chair. As she realized the facts\nshe became thoroughly disgusted, although, perhaps, she was more hurt\nby the concealment of the sin than by the sin itself. She looked\nsplendidly roused and indignant; and Katharine felt an immense relief\nand pride in her mother. It was plain that her indignation was very\ngenuine, and that her mind was as perfectly focused upon the facts as\nany one could wish more so, by a long way, than Aunt Celia s mind,\nwhich seemed to be timidly circling, with a morbid pleasure, in these\nunpleasant shades. She and her mother together would take the situation\nin hand, visit Cyril, and see the whole thing through.\n\n\"We must realize Cyril s point of view first,\" she said, speaking\ndirectly to her mother, as if to a contemporary, but before the words\nwere out of her mouth, there was more confusion outside, and Cousin\nCaroline, Mrs. Hilbery s maiden cousin, entered the room. Although she\nwas by birth an Alardyce, and Aunt Celia a Hilbery, the complexities of\nthe family relationship were such that each was at once first and\nsecond cousin to the other, and thus aunt and cousin to the culprit\nCyril, so that his misbehavior was almost as much Cousin Caroline s\naffair as Aunt Celia s. Cousin Caroline was a lady of very imposing\nheight and circumference, but in spite of her size and her handsome\ntrappings, there was something exposed and unsheltered in her\nexpression, as if for many summers her thin red skin and hooked nose\nand reduplication of chins, so much resembling the profile of a\ncockatoo, had been bared to the weather; she was, indeed, a single\nlady; but she had, it was the habit to say, \"made a life for herself,\"\nand was thus entitled to be heard with respect.\n\n\"This unhappy business,\" she began, out of breath as she was. \"If the\ntrain had not gone out of the station just as I arrived, I should have\nbeen with you before. Celia has doubtless told you. You will agree with\nme, Maggie. He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the\nchildren \"\n\n\"But does he refuse to marry her?\" Mrs. Hilbery inquired, with a return\nof her bewilderment.\n\n\"He has written an absurd perverted letter, all quotations,\" Cousin\nCaroline puffed. \"He thinks he s doing a very fine thing, where we only\nsee the folly of it.... The girl s every bit as infatuated as he is for\nwhich I blame him.\"\n\n\"She entangled him,\" Aunt Celia intervened, with a very curious\nsmoothness of intonation, which seemed to convey a vision of threads\nweaving and interweaving a close, white mesh round their victim.\n\n\"It s no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now,\nCelia,\" said Cousin Caroline with some acerbity, for she believed\nherself the only practical one of the family, and regretted that, owing\nto the slowness of the kitchen clock, Mrs. Milvain had already confused\npoor dear Maggie with her own incomplete version of the facts. \"The\nmischief s done, and very ugly mischief too. Are we to allow the third\nchild to be born out of wedlock? (I am sorry to have to say these\nthings before you, Katharine.) He will bear your name, Maggie your\nfather s name, remember.\"\n\n\"But let us hope it will be a girl,\" said Mrs. Hilbery.\n\nKatharine, who had been looking at her mother constantly, while the\nchatter of tongues held sway, perceived that the look of\nstraightforward indignation had already vanished; her mother was\nevidently casting about in her mind for some method of escape, or\nbright spot, or sudden illumination which should show to the\nsatisfaction of everybody that all had happened, miraculously but\nincontestably, for the best.\n\n\"It s detestable quite detestable!\" she repeated, but in tones of no\ngreat assurance; and then her face lit up with a smile which, tentative\nat first, soon became almost assured. \"Nowadays, people don t think so\nbadly of these things as they used to do,\" she began. \"It will be\nhorribly uncomfortable for them sometimes, but if they are brave,\nclever children, as they will be, I dare say it ll make remarkable\npeople of them in the end. Robert Browning used to say that every great\nman has Jewish blood in him, and we must try to look at it in that\nlight. And, after all, Cyril has acted on principle. One may disagree\nwith his principle, but, at least, one can respect it like the French\nRevolution, or Cromwell cutting the King s head off. Some of the most\nterrible things in history have been done on principle,\" she concluded.\n\n\"I m afraid I take a very different view of principle,\" Cousin Caroline\nremarked tartly.\n\n\"Principle!\" Aunt Celia repeated, with an air of deprecating such a\nword in such a connection. \"I will go to-morrow and see him,\" she\nadded.\n\n\"But why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself,\nCelia?\" Mrs. Hilbery interposed, and Cousin Caroline thereupon\nprotested with some further plan involving sacrifice of herself.\n\nGrowing weary of it all, Katharine turned to the window, and stood\namong the folds of the curtain, pressing close to the window-pane, and\ngazing disconsolately at the river much in the attitude of a child\ndepressed by the meaningless talk of its elders. She was much\ndisappointed in her mother and in herself too. The little tug which she\ngave to the blind, letting it fly up to the top with a snap, signified\nher annoyance. She was very angry, and yet impotent to give expression\nto her anger, or know with whom she was angry. How they talked and\nmoralized and made up stories to suit their own version of the\nbecoming, and secretly praised their own devotion and tact! No; they\nhad their dwelling in a mist, she decided; hundreds of miles away away\nfrom what? \"Perhaps it would be better if I married William,\" she\nthought suddenly, and the thought appeared to loom through the mist\nlike solid ground. She stood there, thinking of her own destiny, and\nthe elder ladies talked on, until they had talked themselves into a\ndecision to ask the young woman to luncheon, and tell her, very\nfriendlily, how such behavior appeared to women like themselves, who\nknew the world. And then Mrs. Hilbery was struck by a better idea.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " X\n\n\nMessrs. Grateley and Hooper, the solicitors in whose firm Ralph Denham\nwas clerk, had their office in Lincoln s Inn Fields, and there Ralph\nDenham appeared every morning very punctually at ten o clock. His\npunctuality, together with other qualities, marked him out among the\nclerks for success, and indeed it would have been safe to wager that in\nten years  time or so one would find him at the head of his profession,\nhad it not been for a peculiarity which sometimes seemed to make\neverything about him uncertain and perilous. His sister Joan had\nalready been disturbed by his love of gambling with his savings.\nScrutinizing him constantly with the eye of affection, she had become\naware of a curious perversity in his temperament which caused her much\nanxiety, and would have caused her still more if she had not recognized\nthe germs of it in her own nature. She could fancy Ralph suddenly\nsacrificing his entire career for some fantastic imagination; some\ncause or idea or even (so her fancy ran) for some woman seen from a\nrailway train, hanging up clothes in a back yard. When he had found\nthis beauty or this cause, no force, she knew, would avail to restrain\nhim from pursuit of it. She suspected the East also, and always\nfidgeted herself when she saw him with a book of Indian travels in his\nhand, as though he were sucking contagion from the page. On the other\nhand, no common love affair, had there been such a thing, would have\ncaused her a moment s uneasiness where Ralph was concerned. He was\ndestined in her fancy for something splendid in the way of success or\nfailure, she knew not which.\n\nAnd yet nobody could have worked harder or done better in all the\nrecognized stages of a young man s life than Ralph had done, and Joan\nhad to gather materials for her fears from trifles in her brother s\nbehavior which would have escaped any other eye. It was natural that\nshe should be anxious. Life had been so arduous for all of them from\nthe start that she could not help dreading any sudden relaxation of his\ngrasp upon what he held, though, as she knew from inspection of her own\nlife, such sudden impulse to let go and make away from the discipline\nand the drudgery was sometimes almost irresistible. But with Ralph, if\nhe broke away, she knew that it would be only to put himself under\nharsher constraint; she figured him toiling through sandy deserts under\na tropical sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some\nfly; she figured him living by the labor of his hands in some city\nslum, the victim of one of those terrible theories of right and wrong\nwhich were current at the time; she figured him prisoner for life in\nthe house of a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes. Half\nproudly, and wholly anxiously, she framed such thoughts, as they sat,\nlate at night, talking together over the gas-stove in Ralph s bedroom.\n\nIt is likely that Ralph would not have recognized his own dream of a\nfuture in the forecasts which disturbed his sister s peace of mind.\nCertainly, if any one of them had been put before him he would have\nrejected it with a laugh, as the sort of life that held no attractions\nfor him. He could not have said how it was that he had put these absurd\nnotions into his sister s head. Indeed, he prided himself upon being\nwell broken into a life of hard work, about which he had no sort of\nillusions. His vision of his own future, unlike many such forecasts,\ncould have been made public at any moment without a blush; he\nattributed to himself a strong brain, and conferred on himself a seat\nin the House of Commons at the age of fifty, a moderate fortune, and,\nwith luck, an unimportant office in a Liberal Government. There was\nnothing extravagant in a forecast of that kind, and certainly nothing\ndishonorable. Nevertheless, as his sister guessed, it needed all\nRalph s strength of will, together with the pressure of circumstances,\nto keep his feet moving in the path which led that way. It needed, in\nparticular, a constant repetition of a phrase to the effect that he\nshared the common fate, found it best of all, and wished for no other;\nand by repeating such phrases he acquired punctuality and habits of\nwork, and could very plausibly demonstrate that to be a clerk in a\nsolicitor s office was the best of all possible lives, and that other\nambitions were vain.\n\nBut, like all beliefs not genuinely held, this one depended very much\nupon the amount of acceptance it received from other people, and in\nprivate, when the pressure of public opinion was removed, Ralph let\nhimself swing very rapidly away from his actual circumstances upon\nstrange voyages which, indeed, he would have been ashamed to describe.\nIn these dreams, of course, he figured in noble and romantic parts, but\nself-glorification was not the only motive of them. They gave outlet to\nsome spirit which found no work to do in real life, for, with the\npessimism which his lot forced upon him, Ralph had made up his mind\nthat there was no use for what, contemptuously enough, he called\ndreams, in the world which we inhabit. It sometimes seemed to him that\nthis spirit was the most valuable possession he had; he thought that by\nmeans of it he could set flowering waste tracts of the earth, cure many\nills, or raise up beauty where none now existed; it was, too, a fierce\nand potent spirit which would devour the dusty books and parchments on\nthe office wall with one lick of its tongue, and leave him in a minute\nstanding in nakedness, if he gave way to it. His endeavor, for many\nyears, had been to control the spirit, and at the age of twenty-nine he\nthought he could pride himself upon a life rigidly divided into the\nhours of work and those of dreams; the two lived side by side without\nharming each other. As a matter of fact, this effort at discipline had\nbeen helped by the interests of a difficult profession, but the old\nconclusion to which Ralph had come when he left college still held sway\nin his mind, and tinged his views with the melancholy belief that life\nfor most people compels the exercise of the lower gifts and wastes the\nprecious ones, until it forces us to agree that there is little virtue,\nas well as little profit, in what once seemed to us the noblest part of\nour inheritance.\n\nDenham was not altogether popular either in his office or among his\nfamily. He was too positive, at this stage of his career, as to what\nwas right and what wrong, too proud of his self-control, and, as is\nnatural in the case of persons not altogether happy or well suited in\ntheir conditions, too apt to prove the folly of contentment, if he\nfound any one who confessed to that weakness. In the office his rather\nostentatious efficiency annoyed those who took their own work more\nlightly, and, if they foretold his advancement, it was not altogether\nsympathetically. Indeed, he appeared to be rather a hard and\nself-sufficient young man, with a queer temper, and manners that were\nuncompromisingly abrupt, who was consumed with a desire to get on in\nthe world, which was natural, these critics thought, in a man of no\nmeans, but not engaging.\n\nThe young men in the office had a perfect right to these opinions,\nbecause Denham showed no particular desire for their friendship. He\nliked them well enough, but shut them up in that compartment of life\nwhich was devoted to work. Hitherto, indeed, he had found little\ndifficulty in arranging his life as methodically as he arranged his\nexpenditure, but about this time he began to encounter experiences\nwhich were not so easy to classify. Mary Datchet had begun this\nconfusion two years ago by bursting into laughter at some remark of\nhis, almost the first time they met. She could not explain why it was.\nShe thought him quite astonishingly odd. When he knew her well enough\nto tell her how he spent Monday and Wednesday and Saturday, she was\nstill more amused; she laughed till he laughed, too, without knowing\nwhy. It seemed to her very odd that he should know as much about\nbreeding bulldogs as any man in England; that he had a collection of\nwild flowers found near London; and his weekly visit to old Miss\nTrotter at Ealing, who was an authority upon the science of Heraldry,\nnever failed to excite her laughter. She wanted to know everything,\neven the kind of cake which the old lady supplied on these occasions;\nand their summer excursions to churches in the neighborhood of London\nfor the purpose of taking rubbings of the brasses became most important\nfestivals, from the interest she took in them. In six months she knew\nmore about his odd friends and hobbies than his own brothers and\nsisters knew, after living with him all his life; and Ralph found this\nvery pleasant, though disordering, for his own view of himself had\nalways been profoundly serious.\n\nCertainly it was very pleasant to be with Mary Datchet and to become,\ndirectly the door was shut, quite a different sort of person, eccentric\nand lovable, with scarcely any likeness to the self most people knew.\nHe became less serious, and rather less dictatorial at home, for he was\napt to hear Mary laughing at him, and telling him, as she was fond of\ndoing, that he knew nothing at all about anything. She made him, also,\ntake an interest in public questions, for which she had a natural\nliking; and was in process of turning him from Tory to Radical, after a\ncourse of public meetings, which began by boring him acutely, and ended\nby exciting him even more than they excited her.\n\nBut he was reserved; when ideas started up in his mind, he divided them\nautomatically into those he could discuss with Mary, and those he must\nkeep for himself. She knew this and it interested her, for she was\naccustomed to find young men very ready to talk about themselves, and\nhad come to listen to them as one listens to children, without any\nthought of herself. But with Ralph, she had very little of this\nmaternal feeling, and, in consequence, a much keener sense of her own\nindividuality.\n\nLate one afternoon Ralph stepped along the Strand to an interview with\na lawyer upon business. The afternoon light was almost over, and\nalready streams of greenish and yellowish artificial light were being\npoured into an atmosphere which, in country lanes, would now have been\nsoft with the smoke of wood fires; and on both sides of the road the\nshop windows were full of sparkling chains and highly polished leather\ncases, which stood upon shelves made of thick plate-glass. None of\nthese different objects was seen separately by Denham, but from all of\nthem he drew an impression of stir and cheerfulness. Thus it came about\nthat he saw Katharine Hilbery coming towards him, and looked straight\nat her, as if she were only an illustration of the argument that was\ngoing forward in his mind. In this spirit he noticed the rather set\nexpression in her eyes, and the slight, half-conscious movement of her\nlips, which, together with her height and the distinction of her dress,\nmade her look as if the scurrying crowd impeded her, and her direction\nwere different from theirs. He noticed this calmly; but suddenly, as he\npassed her, his hands and knees began to tremble, and his heart beat\npainfully. She did not see him, and went on repeating to herself some\nlines which had stuck to her memory: \"It s life that matters, nothing\nbut life the process of discovering the everlasting and perpetual\nprocess, not the discovery itself at all.\" Thus occupied, she did not\nsee Denham, and he had not the courage to stop her. But immediately the\nwhole scene in the Strand wore that curious look of order and purpose\nwhich is imparted to the most heterogeneous things when music sounds;\nand so pleasant was this impression that he was very glad that he had\nnot stopped her, after all. It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he\nstood outside the barrister s chambers.\n\nWhen his interview with the barrister was over, it was too late to go\nback to the office. His sight of Katharine had put him queerly out of\ntune for a domestic evening. Where should he go? To walk through the\nstreets of London until he came to Katharine s house, to look up at the\nwindows and fancy her within, seemed to him possible for a moment; and\nthen he rejected the plan almost with a blush as, with a curious\ndivision of consciousness, one plucks a flower sentimentally and throws\nit away, with a blush, when it is actually picked. No, he would go and\nsee Mary Datchet. By this time she would be back from her work.\n\nTo see Ralph appear unexpectedly in her room threw Mary for a second\noff her balance. She had been cleaning knives in her little scullery,\nand when she had let him in she went back again, and turned on the\ncold-water tap to its fullest volume, and then turned it off again.\n\"Now,\" she thought to herself, as she screwed it tight, \"I m not going\nto let these silly ideas come into my head.... Don t you think Mr.\nAsquith deserves to be hanged?\" she called back into the sitting-room,\nand when she joined him, drying her hands, she began to tell him about\nthe latest evasion on the part of the Government with respect to the\nWomen s Suffrage Bill. Ralph did not want to talk about politics, but\nhe could not help respecting Mary for taking such an interest in public\nquestions. He looked at her as she leant forward, poking the fire, and\nexpressing herself very clearly in phrases which bore distantly the\ntaint of the platform, and he thought, \"How absurd Mary would think me\nif she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to\nChelsea in order to look at Katharine s windows. She wouldn t\nunderstand it, but I like her very much as she is.\"\n\nFor some time they discussed what the women had better do; and as Ralph\nbecame genuinely interested in the question, Mary unconsciously let her\nattention wander, and a great desire came over her to talk to Ralph\nabout her own feelings; or, at any rate, about something personal, so\nthat she might see what he felt for her; but she resisted this wish.\nBut she could not prevent him from feeling her lack of interest in what\nhe was saying, and gradually they both became silent. One thought after\nanother came up in Ralph s mind, but they were all, in some way,\nconnected with Katharine, or with vague feelings of romance and\nadventure such as she inspired. But he could not talk to Mary about\nsuch thoughts; and he pitied her for knowing nothing of what he was\nfeeling. \"Here,\" he thought, \"is where we differ from women; they have\nno sense of romance.\"\n\n\"Well, Mary,\" he said at length, \"why don t you say something amusing?\"\n\nHis tone was certainly provoking, but, as a general rule, Mary was not\neasily provoked. This evening, however, she replied rather sharply:\n\n\"Because I ve got nothing amusing to say, I suppose.\"\n\nRalph thought for a moment, and then remarked:\n\n\"You work too hard. I don t mean your health,\" he added, as she laughed\nscornfully, \"I mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in\nyour work.\"\n\n\"And is that a bad thing?\" she asked, shading her eyes with her hand.\n\n\"I think it is,\" he returned abruptly.\n\n\"But only a week ago you were saying the opposite.\" Her tone was\ndefiant, but she became curiously depressed. Ralph did not perceive it,\nand took this opportunity of lecturing her, and expressing his latest\nviews upon the proper conduct of life. She listened, but her main\nimpression was that he had been meeting some one who had influenced\nhim. He was telling her that she ought to read more, and to see that\nthere were other points of view as deserving of attention as her own.\nNaturally, having last seen him as he left the office in company with\nKatharine, she attributed the change to her; it was likely that\nKatharine, on leaving the scene which she had so clearly despised, had\npronounced some such criticism, or suggested it by her own attitude.\nBut she knew that Ralph would never admit that he had been influenced\nby anybody.\n\n\"You don t read enough, Mary,\" he was saying. \"You ought to read more\npoetry.\"\n\nIt was true that Mary s reading had been rather limited to such works\nas she needed to know for the sake of examinations; and her time for\nreading in London was very little. For some reason, no one likes to be\ntold that they do not read enough poetry, but her resentment was only\nvisible in the way she changed the position of her hands, and in the\nfixed look in her eyes. And then she thought to herself, \"I m behaving\nexactly as I said I wouldn t behave,\" whereupon she relaxed all her\nmuscles and said, in her reasonable way:\n\n\"Tell me what I ought to read, then.\"\n\nRalph had unconsciously been irritated by Mary, and he now delivered\nhimself of a few names of great poets which were the text for a\ndiscourse upon the imperfection of Mary s character and way of life.\n\n\"You live with your inferiors,\" he said, warming unreasonably, as he\nknew, to his text. \"And you get into a groove because, on the whole,\nit s rather a pleasant groove. And you tend to forget what you re there\nfor. You ve the feminine habit of making much of details. You don t see\nwhen things matter and when they don t. And that s what s the ruin of\nall these organizations. That s why the Suffragists have never done\nanything all these years. What s the point of drawing-room meetings and\nbazaars? You want to have ideas, Mary; get hold of something big; never\nmind making mistakes, but don t niggle. Why don t you throw it all up\nfor a year, and travel? see something of the world. Don t be content to\nlive with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life. But you\nwon t,\" he concluded.\n\n\"I ve rather come to that way of thinking myself about myself, I mean,\"\nsaid Mary, surprising him by her acquiescence. \"I should like to go\nsomewhere far away.\"\n\nFor a moment they were both silent. Ralph then said:\n\n\"But look here, Mary, you haven t been taking this seriously, have\nyou?\" His irritation was spent, and the depression, which she could not\nkeep out of her voice, made him feel suddenly with remorse that he had\nbeen hurting her.\n\n\"You won t go away, will you?\" he asked. And as she said nothing, he\nadded, \"Oh no, don t go away.\"\n\n\"I don t know exactly what I mean to do,\" she replied. She hovered on\nthe verge of some discussion of her plans, but she received no\nencouragement. He fell into one of his queer silences, which seemed to\nMary, in spite of all her precautions, to have reference to what she\nalso could not prevent herself from thinking about their feeling for\neach other and their relationship. She felt that the two lines of\nthought bored their way in long, parallel tunnels which came very close\nindeed, but never ran into each other.\n\nWhen he had gone, and he left her without breaking his silence more\nthan was needed to wish her good night, she sat on for a time,\nreviewing what he had said. If love is a devastating fire which melts\nthe whole being into one mountain torrent, Mary was no more in love\nwith Denham than she was in love with her poker or her tongs. But\nprobably these extreme passions are very rare, and the state of mind\nthus depicted belongs to the very last stages of love, when the power\nto resist has been eaten away, week by week or day by day. Like most\nintelligent people, Mary was something of an egoist, to the extent,\nthat is, of attaching great importance to what she felt, and she was by\nnature enough of a moralist to like to make certain, from time to time,\nthat her feelings were creditable to her. When Ralph left her she\nthought over her state of mind, and came to the conclusion that it\nwould be a good thing to learn a language say Italian or German. She\nthen went to a drawer, which she had to unlock, and took from it\ncertain deeply scored manuscript pages. She read them through, looking\nup from her reading every now and then and thinking very intently for a\nfew seconds about Ralph. She did her best to verify all the qualities\nin him which gave rise to emotions in her; and persuaded herself that\nshe accounted reasonably for them all. Then she looked back again at\nher manuscript, and decided that to write grammatical English prose is\nthe hardest thing in the world. But she thought about herself a great\ndeal more than she thought about grammatical English prose or about\nRalph Denham, and it may therefore be disputed whether she was in love,\nor, if so, to which branch of the family her passion belonged.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XI\n\n\n\"It s life that matters, nothing but life the process of discovering,\nthe everlasting and perpetual process,\" said Katharine, as she passed\nunder the archway, and so into the wide space of King s Bench Walk,\n\"not the discovery itself at all.\" She spoke the last words looking up\nat Rodney s windows, which were a semilucent red color, in her honor,\nas she knew. He had asked her to tea with him. But she was in a mood\nwhen it is almost physically disagreeable to interrupt the stride of\none s thought, and she walked up and down two or three times under the\ntrees before approaching his staircase. She liked getting hold of some\nbook which neither her father or mother had read, and keeping it to\nherself, and gnawing its contents in privacy, and pondering the meaning\nwithout sharing her thoughts with any one, or having to decide whether\nthe book was a good one or a bad one. This evening she had twisted the\nwords of Dostoevsky to suit her mood a fatalistic mood to proclaim that\nthe process of discovery was life, and that, presumably, the nature of\none s goal mattered not at all. She sat down for a moment upon one of\nthe seats; felt herself carried along in the swirl of many things;\ndecided, in her sudden way, that it was time to heave all this thinking\noverboard, and rose, leaving a fishmonger s basket on the seat behind\nher. Two minutes later her rap sounded with authority upon Rodney s\ndoor.\n\n\"Well, William,\" she said, \"I m afraid I m late.\"\n\nIt was true, but he was so glad to see her that he forgot his\nannoyance. He had been occupied for over an hour in making things ready\nfor her, and he now had his reward in seeing her look right and left,\nas she slipped her cloak from her shoulders, with evident satisfaction,\nalthough she said nothing. He had seen that the fire burnt well;\njam-pots were on the table, tin covers shone in the fender, and the\nshabby comfort of the room was extreme. He was dressed in his old\ncrimson dressing-gown, which was faded irregularly, and had bright new\npatches on it, like the paler grass which one finds on lifting a stone.\nHe made the tea, and Katharine drew off her gloves, and crossed her\nlegs with a gesture that was rather masculine in its ease. Nor did they\ntalk much until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having\nplaced their teacups upon the floor between them.\n\nThey had not met since they had exchanged letters about their\nrelationship. Katharine s answer to his protestation had been short and\nsensible. Half a sheet of notepaper contained the whole of it, for she\nmerely had to say that she was not in love with him, and so could not\nmarry him, but their friendship would continue, she hoped, unchanged.\nShe had added a postscript in which she stated, \"I like your sonnet\nvery much.\"\n\nSo far as William was concerned, this appearance of ease was assumed.\nThree times that afternoon he had dressed himself in a tail-coat, and\nthree times he had discarded it for an old dressing-gown; three times\nhe had placed his pearl tie-pin in position, and three times he had\nremoved it again, the little looking-glass in his room being the\nwitness of these changes of mind. The question was, which would\nKatharine prefer on this particular afternoon in December? He read her\nnote once more, and the postscript about the sonnet settled the matter.\nEvidently she admired most the poet in him; and as this, on the whole,\nagreed with his own opinion, he decided to err, if anything, on the\nside of shabbiness. His demeanor was also regulated with premeditation;\nhe spoke little, and only on impersonal matters; he wished her to\nrealize that in visiting him for the first time alone she was doing\nnothing remarkable, although, in fact, that was a point about which he\nwas not at all sure.\n\nCertainly Katharine seemed quite unmoved by any disturbing thoughts;\nand if he had been completely master of himself, he might, indeed, have\ncomplained that she was a trifle absent-minded. The ease, the\nfamiliarity of the situation alone with Rodney, among teacups and\ncandles, had more effect upon her than was apparent. She asked to look\nat his books, and then at his pictures. It was while she held\nphotograph from the Greek in her hands that she exclaimed, impulsively,\nif incongruously:\n\n\"My oysters! I had a basket,\" she explained, \"and I ve left it\nsomewhere. Uncle Dudley dines with us to-night. What in the world have\nI done with them?\"\n\nShe rose and began to wander about the room. William rose also, and\nstood in front of the fire, muttering, \"Oysters, oysters your basket of\noysters!\" but though he looked vaguely here and there, as if the\noysters might be on the top of the bookshelf, his eyes returned always\nto Katharine. She drew the curtain and looked out among the scanty\nleaves of the plane-trees.\n\n\"I had them,\" she calculated, \"in the Strand; I sat on a seat. Well,\nnever mind,\" she concluded, turning back into the room abruptly, \"I\ndare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time.\"\n\n\"I should have thought that you never forgot anything,\" William\nremarked, as they settled down again.\n\n\"That s part of the myth about me, I know,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"And I wonder,\" William proceeded, with some caution, \"what the truth\nabout you is? But I know this sort of thing doesn t interest you,\" he\nadded hastily, with a touch of peevishness.\n\n\"No; it doesn t interest me very much,\" she replied candidly.\n\n\"What shall we talk about then?\" he asked.\n\nShe looked rather whimsically round the walls of the room.\n\n\"However we start, we end by talking about the same thing about poetry,\nI mean. I wonder if you realize, William, that I ve never read even\nShakespeare? It s rather wonderful how I ve kept it up all these\nyears.\"\n\n\"You ve kept it up for ten years very beautifully, as far as I m\nconcerned,\" he said.\n\n\"Ten years? So long as that?\"\n\n\"And I don t think it s always bored you,\" he added.\n\nShe looked into the fire silently. She could not deny that the surface\nof her feeling was absolutely unruffled by anything in William s\ncharacter; on the contrary, she felt certain that she could deal with\nwhatever turned up. He gave her peace, in which she could think of\nthings that were far removed from what they talked about. Even now,\nwhen he sat within a yard of her, how easily her mind ranged hither and\nthither! Suddenly a picture presented itself before her, without any\neffort on her part as pictures will, of herself in these very rooms;\nshe had come in from a lecture, and she held a pile of books in her\nhand, scientific books, and books about mathematics and astronomy which\nshe had mastered. She put them down on the table over there. It was a\npicture plucked from her life two or three years hence, when she was\nmarried to William; but here she checked herself abruptly.\n\nShe could not entirely forget William s presence, because, in spite of\nhis efforts to control himself, his nervousness was apparent. On such\noccasions his eyes protruded more than ever, and his face had more than\never the appearance of being covered with a thin crackling skin,\nthrough which every flush of his volatile blood showed itself\ninstantly. By this time he had shaped so many sentences and rejected\nthem, felt so many impulses and subdued them, that he was a uniform\nscarlet.\n\n\"You may say you don t read books,\" he remarked, \"but, all the same,\nyou know about them. Besides, who wants you to be learned? Leave that\nto the poor devils who ve got nothing better to do. You you ahem! \"\n\n\"Well, then, why don t you read me something before I go?\" said\nKatharine, looking at her watch.\n\n\"Katharine, you ve only just come! Let me see now, what have I got to\nshow you?\" He rose, and stirred about the papers on his table, as if in\ndoubt; he then picked up a manuscript, and after spreading it smoothly\nupon his knee, he looked up at Katharine suspiciously. He caught her\nsmiling.\n\n\"I believe you only ask me to read out of kindness,\" he burst out.\n\"Let s find something else to talk about. Who have you been seeing?\"\n\n\"I don t generally ask things out of kindness,\" Katharine observed;\n\"however, if you don t want to read, you needn t.\"\n\nWilliam gave a queer snort of exasperation, and opened his manuscript\nonce more, though he kept his eyes upon her face as he did so. No face\ncould have been graver or more judicial.\n\n\"One can trust you, certainly, to say unpleasant things,\" he said,\nsmoothing out the page, clearing his throat, and reading half a stanza\nto himself. \"Ahem! The Princess is lost in the wood, and she hears the\nsound of a horn. (This would all be very pretty on the stage, but I\ncan t get the effect here.) Anyhow, Sylvano enters, accompanied by the\nrest of the gentlemen of Gratian s court. I begin where he\nsoliloquizes.\" He jerked his head and began to read.\n\nAlthough Katharine had just disclaimed any knowledge of literature, she\nlistened attentively. At least, she listened to the first twenty-five\nlines attentively, and then she frowned. Her attention was only aroused\nagain when Rodney raised his finger a sign, she knew, that the meter\nwas about to change.\n\nHis theory was that every mood has its meter. His mastery of meters was\nvery great; and, if the beauty of a drama depended upon the variety of\nmeasures in which the personages speak, Rodney s plays must have\nchallenged the works of Shakespeare. Katharine s ignorance of\nShakespeare did not prevent her from feeling fairly certain that plays\nshould not produce a sense of chill stupor in the audience, such as\novercame her as the lines flowed on, sometimes long and sometimes\nshort, but always delivered with the same lilt of voice, which seemed\nto nail each line firmly on to the same spot in the hearer s brain.\nStill, she reflected, these sorts of skill are almost exclusively\nmasculine; women neither practice them nor know how to value them; and\none s husband s proficiency in this direction might legitimately\nincrease one s respect for him, since mystification is no bad basis for\nrespect. No one could doubt that William was a scholar. The reading\nended with the finish of the Act; Katharine had prepared a little\nspeech.\n\n\"That seems to me extremely well written, William; although, of course,\nI don t know enough to criticize in detail.\"\n\n\"But it s the skill that strikes you not the emotion?\"\n\n\"In a fragment like that, of course, the skill strikes one most.\"\n\n\"But perhaps have you time to listen to one more short piece? the scene\nbetween the lovers? There s some real feeling in that, I think. Denham\nagrees that it s the best thing I ve done.\"\n\n\"You ve read it to Ralph Denham?\" Katharine inquired, with surprise.\n\"He s a better judge than I am. What did he say?\"\n\n\"My dear Katharine,\" Rodney exclaimed, \"I don t ask you for criticism,\nas I should ask a scholar. I dare say there are only five men in\nEngland whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me. But I trust you\nwhere feeling is concerned. I had you in my mind often when I was\nwriting those scenes. I kept asking myself,  Now is this the sort of\nthing Katharine would like?  I always think of you when I m writing,\nKatharine, even when it s the sort of thing you wouldn t know about.\nAnd I d rather yes, I really believe I d rather you thought well of my\nwriting than any one in the world.\"\n\nThis was so genuine a tribute to his trust in her that Katharine was\ntouched.\n\n\"You think too much of me altogether, William,\" she said, forgetting\nthat she had not meant to speak in this way.\n\n\"No, Katharine, I don t,\" he replied, replacing his manuscript in the\ndrawer. \"It does me good to think of you.\"\n\nSo quiet an answer, followed as it was by no expression of love, but\nmerely by the statement that if she must go he would take her to the\nStrand, and would, if she could wait a moment, change his dressing-gown\nfor a coat, moved her to the warmest feeling of affection for him that\nshe had yet experienced. While he changed in the next room, she stood\nby the bookcase, taking down books and opening them, but reading\nnothing on their pages.\n\nShe felt certain that she would marry Rodney. How could one avoid it?\nHow could one find fault with it? Here she sighed, and, putting the\nthought of marriage away, fell into a dream state, in which she became\nanother person, and the whole world seemed changed. Being a frequent\nvisitor to that world, she could find her way there unhesitatingly. If\nshe had tried to analyze her impressions, she would have said that\nthere dwelt the realities of the appearances which figure in our world;\nso direct, powerful, and unimpeded were her sensations there, compared\nwith those called forth in actual life. There dwelt the things one\nmight have felt, had there been cause; the perfect happiness of which\nhere we taste the fragment; the beauty seen here in flying glimpses\nonly. No doubt much of the furniture of this world was drawn directly\nfrom the past, and even from the England of the Elizabethan age.\nHowever the embellishment of this imaginary world might change, two\nqualities were constant in it. It was a place where feelings were\nliberated from the constraint which the real world puts upon them; and\nthe process of awakenment was always marked by resignation and a kind\nof stoical acceptance of facts. She met no acquaintance there, as\nDenham did, miraculously transfigured; she played no heroic part. But\nthere certainly she loved some magnanimous hero, and as they swept\ntogether among the leaf-hung trees of an unknown world, they shared the\nfeelings which came fresh and fast as the waves on the shore. But the\nsands of her liberation were running fast; even through the forest\nbranches came sounds of Rodney moving things on his dressing-table; and\nKatharine woke herself from this excursion by shutting the cover of the\nbook she was holding, and replacing it in the bookshelf.\n\n\"William,\" she said, speaking rather faintly at first, like one sending\na voice from sleep to reach the living. \"William,\" she repeated firmly,\n\"if you still want me to marry you, I will.\"\n\nPerhaps it was that no man could expect to have the most momentous\nquestion of his life settled in a voice so level, so toneless, so\ndevoid of joy or energy. At any rate William made no answer. She waited\nstoically. A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room,\nand observed that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew\nwhere they could find a fishmonger s shop still open. She breathed\ndeeply a sigh of relief.\n\nExtract from a letter sent a few days later by Mrs. Hilbery to her\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Milvain:\n\n\"... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram. Such a nice,\nrich, English name, too, and, in addition, he has all the graces of\nintellect; he has read literally _everything_. I tell Katharine, I\nshall always put him on my right side at dinner, so as to have him by\nme when people begin talking about characters in Shakespeare. They\nwon t be rich, but they ll be very, very happy. I was sitting in my\nroom late one night, feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me\nagain, when I heard Katharine outside in the passage, and I thought to\nmyself,  Shall I call her in?  and then I thought (in that hopeless,\ndreary way one does think, with the fire going out and one s birthday\njust over),  Why should I lay my troubles on _her?_  But my little\nself-control had its reward, for next moment she tapped at the door and\ncame in, and sat on the rug, and though we neither of us said anything,\nI felt so happy all of a second that I couldn t help crying,  Oh,\nKatharine, when you come to my age, how I hope you ll have a daughter,\ntoo!  You know how silent Katharine is. She was so silent, for such a\nlong time, that in my foolish, nervous state I dreaded something, I\ndon t quite know what. And then she told me how, after all, she had\nmade up her mind. She had written. She expected him to-morrow. At first\nI wasn t glad at all. I didn t want her to marry any one; but when she\nsaid,  It will make no difference. I shall always care for you and\nfather most,  then I saw how selfish I was, and I told her she must\ngive him everything, everything, everything! I told her I should be\nthankful to come second. But why, when everything s turned out just as\none always hoped it would turn out, why then can one do nothing but\ncry, nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life s been a failure,\nand now is nearly over, and age is so cruel? But Katharine said to me,\n I am happy. I m very happy.  And then I thought, though it all seemed\nso desperately dismal at the time, Katharine had said she was happy,\nand I should have a son, and it would all turn out so much more\nwonderfully than I could possibly imagine, for though the sermons don t\nsay so, I do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in. She told\nme that they would live quite near us, and see us every day; and she\nwould go on with the Life, and we should finish it as we had meant to.\nAnd, after all, it would be far more horrid if she didn t marry or\nsuppose she married some one we couldn t endure? Suppose she had fallen\nin love with some one who was married already?\"\n\n\"And though one never thinks any one good enough for the people one s\nfond of, he has the kindest, truest instincts, I m sure, and though he\nseems nervous and his manner is not commanding, I only think these\nthings because it s Katharine. And now I ve written this, it comes over\nme that, of course, all the time, Katharine has what he hasn t. She\ndoes command, she isn t nervous; it comes naturally to her to rule and\ncontrol. It s time that she should give all this to some one who will\nneed her when we aren t there, save in our spirits, for whatever people\nsay, I m sure I shall come back to this wonderful world where one s\nbeen so happy and so miserable, where, even now, I seem to see myself\nstretching out my hands for another present from the great Fairy Tree\nwhose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys, though they are rarer\nnow, perhaps, and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky,\nbut the stars and the tops of the mountains.\"\n\n\"One doesn t know any more, does one? One hasn t any advice to give\none s children. One can only hope that they will have the same vision\nand the same power to believe, without which life would be so\nmeaningless. That is what I ask for Katharine and her husband.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XII\n\n\n\"Is Mr. Hilbery at home, or Mrs. Hilbery?\" Denham asked, of the\nparlor-maid in Chelsea, a week later.\n\n\"No, sir. But Miss Hilbery is at home,\" the girl answered.\n\nRalph had anticipated many answers, but not this one, and now it was\nunexpectedly made plain to him that it was the chance of seeing\nKatharine that had brought him all the way to Chelsea on pretence of\nseeing her father.\n\nHe made some show of considering the matter, and was taken upstairs to\nthe drawing-room. As upon that first occasion, some weeks ago, the door\nclosed as if it were a thousand doors softly excluding the world; and\nonce more Ralph received an impression of a room full of deep shadows,\nfirelight, unwavering silver candle flames, and empty spaces to be\ncrossed before reaching the round table in the middle of the room, with\nits frail burden of silver trays and china teacups. But this time\nKatharine was there by herself; the volume in her hand showed that she\nexpected no visitors.\n\nRalph said something about hoping to find her father.\n\n\"My father is out,\" she replied. \"But if you can wait, I expect him\nsoon.\"\n\nIt might have been due merely to politeness, but Ralph felt that she\nreceived him almost with cordiality. Perhaps she was bored by drinking\ntea and reading a book all alone; at any rate, she tossed the book on\nto a sofa with a gesture of relief.\n\n\"Is that one of the moderns whom you despise?\" he asked, smiling at the\ncarelessness of her gesture.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I think even you would despise him.\"\n\n\"Even I?\" he repeated. \"Why even I?\"\n\n\"You said you liked modern things; I said I hated them.\"\n\nThis was not a very accurate report of their conversation among the\nrelics, perhaps, but Ralph was flattered to think that she remembered\nanything about it.\n\n\"Or did I confess that I hated all books?\" she went on, seeing him look\nup with an air of inquiry. \"I forget \"\n\n\"Do you hate all books?\" he asked.\n\n\"It would be absurd to say that I hate all books when I ve only read\nten, perhaps; but   Here she pulled herself up short.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do hate books,\" she continued. \"Why do you want to be for ever\ntalking about your feelings? That s what I can t make out. And poetry s\nall about feelings novels are all about feelings.\"\n\nShe cut a cake vigorously into slices, and providing a tray with bread\nand butter for Mrs. Hilbery, who was in her room with a cold, she rose\nto go upstairs.\n\nRalph held the door open for her, and then stood with clasped hands in\nthe middle of the room. His eyes were bright, and, indeed, he scarcely\nknew whether they beheld dreams or realities. All down the street and\non the doorstep, and while he mounted the stairs, his dream of\nKatharine possessed him; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed\nit, in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt\nof her and what she was. And in five minutes she had filled the shell\nof the old dream with the flesh of life; looked with fire out of\nphantom eyes. He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself\namong her chairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back\nof the chair in which Katharine had sat; and yet they were unreal; the\natmosphere was that of a dream. He summoned all the faculties of his\nspirit to seize what the minutes had to give him; and from the depths\nof his mind there rose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that\nhuman nature surpasses, in its beauty, all that our wildest dreams\nbring us hints of.\n\nKatharine came into the room a moment later. He stood watching her come\ntowards him, and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream\nof her; for the real Katharine could speak the words which seemed to\ncrowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes, and the\ncommonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light. And she\noverflowed the edges of the dream; he remarked that her softness was\nlike that of some vast snowy owl; she wore a ruby on her finger.\n\n\"My mother wants me to tell you,\" she said, \"that she hopes you have\nbegun your poem. She says every one ought to write poetry.... All my\nrelations write poetry,\" she went on. \"I can t bear to think of it\nsometimes because, of course, it s none of it any good. But then one\nneedn t read it \"\n\n\"You don t encourage me to write a poem,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"But you re not a poet, too, are you?\" she inquired, turning upon him\nwith a laugh.\n\n\"Should I tell you if I were?\"\n\n\"Yes. Because I think you speak the truth,\" she said, searching him for\nproof of this apparently, with eyes now almost impersonally direct. It\nwould be easy, Ralph thought, to worship one so far removed, and yet of\nso straight a nature; easy to submit recklessly to her, without thought\nof future pain.\n\n\"Are you a poet?\" she demanded. He felt that her question had an\nunexplained weight of meaning behind it, as if she sought an answer to\na question that she did not ask.\n\n\"No. I haven t written any poetry for years,\" he replied. \"But all the\nsame, I don t agree with you. I think it s the only thing worth doing.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" she asked, almost with impatience, tapping her\nspoon two or three times against the side of her cup.\n\n\"Why?\" Ralph laid hands on the first words that came to mind. \"Because,\nI suppose, it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise.\"\n\nA curious change came over her face, as if the flame of her mind were\nsubdued; and she looked at him ironically and with the expression which\nhe had called sad before, for want of a better name for it.\n\n\"I don t know that there s much sense in having ideals,\" she said.\n\n\"But you have them,\" he replied energetically. \"Why do we call them\nideals? It s a stupid word. Dreams, I mean \"\n\nShe followed his words with parted lips, as though to answer eagerly\nwhen he had done; but as he said, \"Dreams, I mean,\" the door of the\ndrawing-room swung open, and so remained for a perceptible instant.\nThey both held themselves silent, her lips still parted.\n\nFar off, they heard the rustle of skirts. Then the owner of the skirts\nappeared in the doorway, which she almost filled, nearly concealing the\nfigure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her.\n\n\"My aunts!\" Katharine murmured, under her breath. Her tone had a hint\nof tragedy in it, but no less, Ralph thought, than the situation\nrequired. She addressed the larger lady as Aunt Millicent; the smaller\nwas Aunt Celia, Mrs. Milvain, who had lately undertaken the task of\nmarrying Cyril to his wife. Both ladies, but Mrs. Cosham (Aunt\nMillicent) in particular, had that look of heightened, smoothed,\nincarnadined existence which is proper to elderly ladies paying calls\nin London about five o clock in the afternoon. Portraits by Romney,\nseen through glass, have something of their pink, mellow look, their\nblooming softness, as of apricots hanging upon a red wall in the\nafternoon sun. Mrs. Cosham was so appareled with hanging muffs, chains,\nand swinging draperies that it was impossible to detect the shape of a\nhuman being in the mass of brown and black which filled the arm-chair.\nMrs. Milvain was a much slighter figure; but the same doubt as to the\nprecise lines of her contour filled Ralph, as he regarded them, with\ndismal foreboding. What remark of his would ever reach these fabulous\nand fantastic characters? for there was something fantastically unreal\nin the curious swayings and noddings of Mrs. Cosham, as if her\nequipment included a large wire spring. Her voice had a high-pitched,\ncooing note, which prolonged words and cut them short until the English\nlanguage seemed no longer fit for common purposes. In a moment of\nnervousness, so Ralph thought, Katharine had turned on innumerable\nelectric lights. But Mrs. Cosham had gained impetus (perhaps her\nswaying movements had that end in view) for sustained speech; and she\nnow addressed Ralph deliberately and elaborately.\n\n\"I come from Woking, Mr. Popham. You may well ask me, why Woking? and\nto that I answer, for perhaps the hundredth time, because of the\nsunsets. We went there for the sunsets, but that was five-and-twenty\nyears ago. Where are the sunsets now? Alas! There is no sunset now\nnearer than the South Coast.\" Her rich and romantic notes were\naccompanied by a wave of a long white hand, which, when waved, gave off\na flash of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Ralph wondered whether she\nmore resembled an elephant, with a jeweled head-dress, or a superb\ncockatoo, balanced insecurely upon its perch, and pecking capriciously\nat a lump of sugar.\n\n\"Where are the sunsets now?\" she repeated. \"Do you find sunsets now,\nMr. Popham?\"\n\n\"I live at Highgate,\" he replied.\n\n\"At Highgate? Yes, Highgate has its charms; your Uncle John lived at\nHighgate,\" she jerked in the direction of Katharine. She sank her head\nupon her breast, as if for a moment s meditation, which past, she\nlooked up and observed: \"I dare say there are very pretty lanes in\nHighgate. I can recollect walking with your mother, Katharine, through\nlanes blossoming with wild hawthorn. But where is the hawthorn now? You\nremember that exquisite description in De Quincey, Mr. Popham? but I\nforget, you, in your generation, with all your activity and\nenlightenment, at which I can only marvel\" here she displayed both her\nbeautiful white hands \"do not read De Quincey. You have your Belloc,\nyour Chesterton, your Bernard Shaw why should you read De Quincey?\"\n\n\"But I do read De Quincey,\" Ralph protested, \"more than Belloc and\nChesterton, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Cosham, with a gesture of surprise and relief\nmingled. \"You are, then, a  rara avis  in your generation. I am\ndelighted to meet anyone who reads De Quincey.\"\n\nHere she hollowed her hand into a screen, and, leaning towards\nKatharine, inquired, in a very audible whisper, \"Does your friend\n_write?_\"\n\n\"Mr. Denham,\" said Katharine, with more than her usual clearness and\nfirmness, \"writes for the Review. He is a lawyer.\"\n\n\"The clean-shaven lips, showing the expression of the mouth! I\nrecognize them at once. I always feel at home with lawyers, Mr.\nDenham \"\n\n\"They used to come about so much in the old days,\" Mrs. Milvain\ninterposed, the frail, silvery notes of her voice falling with the\nsweet tone of an old bell.\n\n\"You say you live at Highgate,\" she continued. \"I wonder whether you\nhappen to know if there is an old house called Tempest Lodge still in\nexistence an old white house in a garden?\"\n\nRalph shook his head, and she sighed.\n\n\"Ah, no; it must have been pulled down by this time, with all the other\nold houses. There were such pretty lanes in those days. That was how\nyour uncle met your Aunt Emily, you know,\" she addressed Katharine.\n\"They walked home through the lanes.\"\n\n\"A sprig of May in her bonnet,\" Mrs. Cosham ejaculated, reminiscently.\n\n\"And next Sunday he had violets in his buttonhole. And that was how we\nguessed.\"\n\nKatharine laughed. She looked at Ralph. His eyes were meditative, and\nshe wondered what he found in this old gossip to make him ponder so\ncontentedly. She felt, she hardly knew why, a curious pity for him.\n\n\"Uncle John yes,  poor John,  you always called him. Why was that?\" she\nasked, to make them go on talking, which, indeed, they needed little\ninvitation to do.\n\n\"That was what his father, old Sir Richard, always called him. Poor\nJohn, or the fool of the family,\" Mrs. Milvain hastened to inform them.\n\"The other boys were so brilliant, and he could never pass his\nexaminations, so they sent him to India a long voyage in those days,\npoor fellow. You had your own room, you know, and you did it up. But he\nwill get his knighthood and a pension, I believe,\" she said, turning to\nRalph, \"only it is not England.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mrs. Cosham confirmed her, \"it is not England. In those days we\nthought an Indian Judgeship about equal to a county-court judgeship at\nhome. His Honor a pretty title, but still, not at the top of the tree.\nHowever,\" she sighed, \"if you have a wife and seven children, and\npeople nowadays very quickly forget your father s name well, you have\nto take what you can get,\" she concluded.\n\n\"And I fancy,\" Mrs. Milvain resumed, lowering her voice rather\nconfidentially, \"that John would have done more if it hadn t been for\nhis wife, your Aunt Emily. She was a very good woman, devoted to him,\nof course, but she was not ambitious for him, and if a wife isn t\nambitious for her husband, especially in a profession like the law,\nclients soon get to know of it. In our young days, Mr. Denham, we used\nto say that we knew which of our friends would become judges, by\nlooking at the girls they married. And so it was, and so, I fancy, it\nalways will be. I don t think,\" she added, summing up these scattered\nremarks, \"that any man is really happy unless he succeeds in his\nprofession.\"\n\nMrs. Cosham approved of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity\nfrom her side of the tea-table, in the first place by swaying her head,\nand in the second by remarking:\n\n\"No, men are not the same as women. I fancy Alfred Tennyson spoke the\ntruth about that as about many other things. How I wish he d lived to\nwrite  The Prince  a sequel to  The Princess ! I confess I m almost\ntired of Princesses. We want some one to show us what a good man can\nbe. We have Laura and Beatrice, Antigone and Cordelia, but we have no\nheroic man. How do you, as a poet, account for that, Mr. Denham?\"\n\n\"I m not a poet,\" said Ralph good-humoredly. \"I m only a solicitor.\"\n\n\"But you write, too?\" Mrs. Cosham demanded, afraid lest she should be\nbalked of her priceless discovery, a young man truly devoted to\nliterature.\n\n\"In my spare time,\" Denham reassured her.\n\n\"In your spare time!\" Mrs. Cosham echoed. \"That is a proof of devotion,\nindeed.\" She half closed her eyes, and indulged herself in a\nfascinating picture of a briefless barrister lodged in a garret,\nwriting immortal novels by the light of a farthing dip. But the romance\nwhich fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages\nwas no false radiance in her case. She carried her pocket Shakespeare\nabout with her, and met life fortified by the words of the poets. How\nfar she saw Denham, and how far she confused him with some hero of\nfiction, it would be hard to say. Literature had taken possession even\nof her memories. She was matching him, presumably, with certain\ncharacters in the old novels, for she came out, after a pause, with:\n\n\"Um um Pendennis Warrington I could never forgive Laura,\" she\npronounced energetically, \"for not marrying George, in spite of\neverything. George Eliot did the very same thing; and Lewes was a\nlittle frog-faced man, with the manner of a dancing master. But\nWarrington, now, had everything in his favor; intellect, passion,\nromance, distinction, and the connection was a mere piece of\nundergraduate folly. Arthur, I confess, has always seemed to me a bit\nof a fop; I can t imagine how Laura married him. But you say you re a\nsolicitor, Mr. Denham. Now there are one or two things I should like to\nask you about Shakespeare \" She drew out her small, worn volume with\nsome difficulty, opened it, and shook it in the air. \"They say,\nnowadays, that Shakespeare was a lawyer. They say, that accounts for\nhis knowledge of human nature. There s a fine example for you, Mr.\nDenham. Study your clients, young man, and the world will be the richer\none of these days, I have no doubt. Tell me, how do we come out of it,\nnow; better or worse than you expected?\"\n\nThus called upon to sum up the worth of human nature in a few words,\nRalph answered unhesitatingly:\n\n\"Worse, Mrs. Cosham, a good deal worse. I m afraid the ordinary man is\na bit of a rascal \"\n\n\"And the ordinary woman?\"\n\n\"No, I don t like the ordinary woman either \"\n\n\"Ah, dear me, I ve no doubt that s very true, very true.\" Mrs. Cosham\nsighed. \"Swift would have agreed with you, anyhow \" She looked at him,\nand thought that there were signs of distinct power in his brow. He\nwould do well, she thought, to devote himself to satire.\n\n\"Charles Lavington, you remember, was a solicitor,\" Mrs. Milvain\ninterposed, rather resenting the waste of time involved in talking\nabout fictitious people when you might be talking about real people.\n\"But you wouldn t remember him, Katharine.\"\n\n\"Mr. Lavington? Oh, yes, I do,\" said Katharine, waking from other\nthoughts with her little start. \"The summer we had a house near Tenby.\nI remember the field and the pond with the tadpoles, and making\nhaystacks with Mr. Lavington.\"\n\n\"She is right. There _was_ a pond with tadpoles,\" Mrs. Cosham\ncorroborated. \"Millais made studies of it for  Ophelia.  Some say that\nis the best picture he ever painted \"\n\n\"And I remember the dog chained up in the yard, and the dead snakes\nhanging in the toolhouse.\"\n\n\"It was at Tenby that you were chased by the bull,\" Mrs. Milvain\ncontinued. \"But that you couldn t remember, though it s true you were a\nwonderful child. Such eyes she had, Mr. Denham! I used to say to her\nfather,  She s watching us, and summing us all up in her little mind. \nAnd they had a nurse in those days,\" she went on, telling her story\nwith charming solemnity to Ralph, \"who was a good woman, but engaged to\na sailor. When she ought to have been attending to the baby, her eyes\nwere on the sea. And Mrs. Hilbery allowed this girl Susan her name\nwas to have him to stay in the village. They abused her goodness, I m\nsorry to say, and while they walked in the lanes, they stood the\nperambulator alone in a field where there was a bull. The animal became\nenraged by the red blanket in the perambulator, and Heaven knows what\nmight have happened if a gentleman had not been walking by in the nick\nof time, and rescued Katharine in his arms!\"\n\n\"I think the bull was only a cow, Aunt Celia,\" said Katharine.\n\n\"My darling, it was a great red Devonshire bull, and not long after it\ngored a man to death and had to be destroyed. And your mother forgave\nSusan a thing I could never have done.\"\n\n\"Maggie s sympathies were entirely with Susan and the sailor, I am\nsure,\" said Mrs. Cosham, rather tartly. \"My sister-in-law,\" she\ncontinued, \"has laid her burdens upon Providence at every crisis in her\nlife, and Providence, I must confess, has responded nobly, so far \"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine, with a laugh, for she liked the rashness which\nirritated the rest of the family. \"My mother s bulls always turn into\ncows at the critical moment.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Milvain, \"I m glad you have some one to protect you\nfrom bulls now.\"\n\n\"I can t imagine William protecting any one from bulls,\" said\nKatharine.\n\nIt happened that Mrs. Cosham had once more produced her pocket volume\nof Shakespeare, and was consulting Ralph upon an obscure passage in\n\"Measure for Measure.\" He did not at once seize the meaning of what\nKatharine and her aunt were saying; William, he supposed, referred to\nsome small cousin, for he now saw Katharine as a child in a pinafore;\nbut, nevertheless, he was so much distracted that his eye could hardly\nfollow the words on the paper. A moment later he heard them speak\ndistinctly of an engagement ring.\n\n\"I like rubies,\" he heard Katharine say.\n\n     \"To be imprison d in the viewless winds,\n     And blown with restless violence round about\n     The pendant world....\"\n\nMrs. Cosham intoned; at the same instant \"Rodney\" fitted itself to\n\"William\" in Ralph s mind. He felt convinced that Katharine was engaged\nto Rodney. His first sensation was one of violent rage with her for\nhaving deceived him throughout the visit, fed him with pleasant old\nwives  tales, let him see her as a child playing in a meadow, shared\nher youth with him, while all the time she was a stranger entirely, and\nengaged to marry Rodney.\n\nBut was it possible? Surely it was not possible. For in his eyes she\nwas still a child. He paused so long over the book that Mrs. Cosham had\ntime to look over his shoulder and ask her niece:\n\n\"And have you settled upon a house yet, Katharine?\"\n\nThis convinced him of the truth of the monstrous idea. He looked up at\nonce and said:\n\n\"Yes, it s a difficult passage.\"\n\nHis voice had changed so much, he spoke with such curtness and even\nwith such contempt, that Mrs. Cosham looked at him fairly puzzled.\nHappily she belonged to a generation which expected uncouthness in its\nmen, and she merely felt convinced that this Mr. Denham was very, very\nclever. She took back her Shakespeare, as Denham seemed to have no more\nto say, and secreted it once more about her person with the infinitely\npathetic resignation of the old.\n\n\"Katharine s engaged to William Rodney,\" she said, by way of filling in\nthe pause; \"a very old friend of ours. He has a wonderful knowledge of\nliterature, too wonderful.\" She nodded her head rather vaguely. \"You\nshould meet each other.\"\n\nDenham s one wish was to leave the house as soon as he could; but the\nelderly ladies had risen, and were proposing to visit Mrs. Hilbery in\nher bedroom, so that any move on his part was impossible. At the same\ntime, he wished to say something, but he knew not what, to Katharine\nalone. She took her aunts upstairs, and returned, coming towards him\nonce more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him.\n\n\"My father will be back,\" she said. \"Won t you sit down?\" and she\nlaughed, as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the\ntea-party.\n\nBut Ralph made no attempt to seat himself.\n\n\"I must congratulate you,\" he said. \"It was news to me.\" He saw her\nface change, but only to become graver than before.\n\n\"My engagement?\" she asked. \"Yes, I am going to marry William Rodney.\"\n\nRalph remained standing with his hand on the back of a chair in\nabsolute silence. Abysses seemed to plunge into darkness between them.\nHe looked at her, but her face showed that she was not thinking of him.\nNo regret or consciousness of wrong disturbed her.\n\n\"Well, I must go,\" he said at length.\n\nShe seemed about to say something, then changed her mind and said\nmerely:\n\n\"You will come again, I hope. We always seem\" she hesitated \"to be\ninterrupted.\"\n\nHe bowed and left the room.\n\nRalph strode with extreme swiftness along the Embankment. Every muscle\nwas taut and braced as if to resist some sudden attack from outside.\nFor the moment it seemed as if the attack were about to be directed\nagainst his body, and his brain thus was on the alert, but without\nunderstanding. Finding himself, after a few minutes, no longer under\nobservation, and no attack delivered, he slackened his pace, the pain\nspread all through him, took possession of every governing seat, and\nmet with scarcely any resistance from powers exhausted by their first\neffort at defence. He took his way languidly along the river\nembankment, away from home rather than towards it. The world had him at\nits mercy. He made no pattern out of the sights he saw. He felt himself\nnow, as he had often fancied other people, adrift on the stream, and\nfar removed from control of it, a man with no grasp upon circumstances\nany longer. Old battered men loafing at the doors of public-houses now\nseemed to be his fellows, and he felt, as he supposed them to feel, a\nmingling of envy and hatred towards those who passed quickly and\ncertainly to a goal of their own. They, too, saw things very thin and\nshadowy, and were wafted about by the lightest breath of wind. For the\nsubstantial world, with its prospect of avenues leading on and on to\nthe invisible distance, had slipped from him, since Katharine was\nengaged. Now all his life was visible, and the straight, meager path\nhad its ending soon enough. Katharine was engaged, and she had deceived\nhim, too. He felt for corners of his being untouched by his disaster;\nbut there was no limit to the flood of damage; not one of his\npossessions was safe now. Katharine had deceived him; she had mixed\nherself with every thought of his, and reft of her they seemed false\nthoughts which he would blush to think again. His life seemed\nimmeasurably impoverished.\n\nHe sat himself down, in spite of the chilly fog which obscured the\nfarther bank and left its lights suspended upon a blank surface, upon\none of the riverside seats, and let the tide of disillusionment sweep\nthrough him. For the time being all bright points in his life were\nblotted out; all prominences leveled. At first he made himself believe\nthat Katharine had treated him badly, and drew comfort from the thought\nthat, left alone, she would recollect this, and think of him and tender\nhim, in silence, at any rate, an apology. But this grain of comfort\nfailed him after a second or two, for, upon reflection, he had to admit\nthat Katharine owed him nothing. Katharine had promised nothing, taken\nnothing; to her his dreams had meant nothing. This, indeed, was the\nlowest pitch of his despair. If the best of one s feelings means\nnothing to the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is\nleft us? The old romance which had warmed his days for him, the\nthoughts of Katharine which had painted every hour, were now made to\nappear foolish and enfeebled. He rose, and looked into the river, whose\nswift race of dun-colored waters seemed the very spirit of futility and\noblivion.\n\n\"In what can one trust, then?\" he thought, as he leant there. So feeble\nand insubstantial did he feel himself that he repeated the word aloud.\n\n\"In what can one trust? Not in men and women. Not in one s dreams about\nthem. There s nothing nothing, nothing left at all.\"\n\nNow Denham had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep\nalive a fine anger when he chose. Rodney provided a good target for\nthat emotion. And yet at the moment, Rodney and Katharine herself\nseemed disembodied ghosts. He could scarcely remember the look of them.\nHis mind plunged lower and lower. Their marriage seemed of no\nimportance to him. All things had turned to ghosts; the whole mass of\nthe world was insubstantial vapor, surrounding the solitary spark in\nhis mind, whose burning point he could remember, for it burnt no more.\nHe had once cherished a belief, and Katharine had embodied this belief,\nand she did so no longer. He did not blame her; he blamed nothing,\nnobody; he saw the truth. He saw the dun-colored race of waters and the\nblank shore. But life is vigorous; the body lives, and the body, no\ndoubt, dictated the reflection, which now urged him to movement, that\none may cast away the forms of human beings, and yet retain the passion\nwhich seemed inseparable from their existence in the flesh. Now this\npassion burnt on his horizon, as the winter sun makes a greenish pane\nin the west through thinning clouds. His eyes were set on something\ninfinitely far and remote; by that light he felt he could walk, and\nwould, in future, have to find his way. But that was all there was left\nto him of a populous and teeming world.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIII\n\n\nThe lunch hour in the office was only partly spent by Denham in the\nconsumption of food. Whether fine or wet, he passed most of it pacing\nthe gravel paths in Lincoln s Inn Fields. The children got to know his\nfigure, and the sparrows expected their daily scattering of\nbread-crumbs. No doubt, since he often gave a copper and almost always\na handful of bread, he was not as blind to his surroundings as he\nthought himself.\n\nHe thought that these winter days were spent in long hours before white\npapers radiant in electric light; and in short passages through\nfog-dimmed streets. When he came back to his work after lunch he\ncarried in his head a picture of the Strand, scattered with omnibuses,\nand of the purple shapes of leaves pressed flat upon the gravel, as if\nhis eyes had always been bent upon the ground. His brain worked\nincessantly, but his thought was attended with so little joy that he\ndid not willingly recall it; but drove ahead, now in this direction,\nnow in that; and came home laden with dark books borrowed from a\nlibrary.\n\nMary Datchet, coming from the Strand at lunch-time, saw him one day\ntaking his turn, closely buttoned in an overcoat, and so lost in\nthought that he might have been sitting in his own room.\n\nShe was overcome by something very like awe by the sight of him; then\nshe felt much inclined to laugh, although her pulse beat faster. She\npassed him, and he never saw her. She came back and touched him on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Gracious, Mary!\" he exclaimed. \"How you startled me!\"\n\n\"Yes. You looked as if you were walking in your sleep,\" she said. \"Are\nyou arranging some terrible love affair? Have you got to reconcile a\ndesperate couple?\"\n\n\"I wasn t thinking about my work,\" Ralph replied, rather hastily. \"And,\nbesides, that sort of thing s not in my line,\" he added, rather grimly.\n\nThe morning was fine, and they had still some minutes of leisure to\nspend. They had not met for two or three weeks, and Mary had much to\nsay to Ralph; but she was not certain how far he wished for her\ncompany. However, after a turn or two, in which a few facts were\ncommunicated, he suggested sitting down, and she took the seat beside\nhim. The sparrows came fluttering about them, and Ralph produced from\nhis pocket the half of a roll saved from his luncheon. He threw a few\ncrumbs among them.\n\n\"I ve never seen sparrows so tame,\" Mary observed, by way of saying\nsomething.\n\n\"No,\" said Ralph. \"The sparrows in Hyde Park aren t as tame as this. If\nwe keep perfectly still, I ll get one to settle on my arm.\"\n\nMary felt that she could have forgone this display of animal good\ntemper, but seeing that Ralph, for some curious reason, took a pride in\nthe sparrows, she bet him sixpence that he would not succeed.\n\n\"Done!\" he said; and his eye, which had been gloomy, showed a spark of\nlight. His conversation was now addressed entirely to a bald\ncock-sparrow, who seemed bolder than the rest; and Mary took the\nopportunity of looking at him. She was not satisfied; his face was\nworn, and his expression stern. A child came bowling its hoop through\nthe concourse of birds, and Ralph threw his last crumbs of bread into\nthe bushes with a snort of impatience.\n\n\"That s what always happens just as I ve almost got him,\" he said.\n\"Here s your sixpence, Mary. But you ve only got it thanks to that\nbrute of a boy. They oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops here \"\n\n\"Oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops! My dear Ralph, what nonsense!\"\n\n\"You always say that,\" he complained; \"and it isn t nonsense. What s\nthe point of having a garden if one can t watch birds in it? The street\ndoes all right for hoops. And if children can t be trusted in the\nstreets, their mothers should keep them at home.\"\n\nMary made no answer to this remark, but frowned.\n\nShe leant back on the seat and looked about her at the great houses\nbreaking the soft gray-blue sky with their chimneys.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" she said, \"London s a fine place to live in. I believe I\ncould sit and watch people all day long. I like my\nfellow-creatures....\"\n\nRalph sighed impatiently.\n\n\"Yes, I think so, when you come to know them,\" she added, as if his\ndisagreement had been spoken.\n\n\"That s just when I don t like them,\" he replied. \"Still, I don t see\nwhy you shouldn t cherish that illusion, if it pleases you.\" He spoke\nwithout much vehemence of agreement or disagreement. He seemed chilled.\n\n\"Wake up, Ralph! You re half asleep!\" Mary cried, turning and pinching\nhis sleeve. \"What have you been doing with yourself? Moping? Working?\nDespising the world, as usual?\"\n\nAs he merely shook his head, and filled his pipe, she went on:\n\n\"It s a bit of a pose, isn t it?\"\n\n\"Not more than most things,\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" Mary remarked, \"I ve a great deal to say to you, but I must go\non we have a committee.\" She rose, but hesitated, looking down upon him\nrather gravely. \"You don t look happy, Ralph,\" she said. \"Is it\nanything, or is it nothing?\"\n\nHe did not immediately answer her, but rose, too, and walked with her\ntowards the gate. As usual, he did not speak to her without considering\nwhether what he was about to say was the sort of thing that he could\nsay to her.\n\n\"I ve been bothered,\" he said at length. \"Partly by work, and partly by\nfamily troubles. Charles has been behaving like a fool. He wants to go\nout to Canada as a farmer \"\n\n\"Well, there s something to be said for that,\" said Mary; and they\npassed the gate, and walked slowly round the Fields again, discussing\ndifficulties which, as a matter of fact, were more or less chronic in\nthe Denham family, and only now brought forward to appease Mary s\nsympathy, which, however, soothed Ralph more than he was aware of. She\nmade him at least dwell upon problems which were real in the sense that\nthey were capable of solution; and the true cause of his melancholy,\nwhich was not susceptible to such treatment, sank rather more deeply\ninto the shades of his mind.\n\nMary was attentive; she was helpful. Ralph could not help feeling\ngrateful to her, the more so, perhaps, because he had not told her the\ntruth about his state; and when they reached the gate again he wished\nto make some affectionate objection to her leaving him. But his\naffection took the rather uncouth form of expostulating with her about\nher work.\n\n\"What d you want to sit on a committee for?\" he asked. \"It s waste of\nyour time, Mary.\"\n\n\"I agree with you that a country walk would benefit the world more,\"\nshe said. \"Look here,\" she added suddenly, \"why don t you come to us at\nChristmas? It s almost the best time of year.\"\n\n\"Come to you at Disham?\" Ralph repeated.\n\n\"Yes. We won t interfere with you. But you can tell me later,\" she\nsaid, rather hastily, and then started off in the direction of Russell\nSquare. She had invited him on the impulse of the moment, as a vision\nof the country came before her; and now she was annoyed with herself\nfor having done so, and then she was annoyed at being annoyed.\n\n\"If I can t face a walk in a field alone with Ralph,\" she reasoned,\n\"I d better buy a cat and live in a lodging at Ealing, like Sally\nSeal and he won t come. Or did he mean that he _would_ come?\"\n\nShe shook her head. She really did not know what he had meant. She\nnever felt quite certain; but now she was more than usually baffled.\nWas he concealing something from her? His manner had been odd; his deep\nabsorption had impressed her; there was something in him that she had\nnot fathomed, and the mystery of his nature laid more of a spell upon\nher than she liked. Moreover, she could not prevent herself from doing\nnow what she had often blamed others of her sex for doing from endowing\nher friend with a kind of heavenly fire, and passing her life before it\nfor his sanction.\n\nUnder this process, the committee rather dwindled in importance; the\nSuffrage shrank; she vowed she would work harder at the Italian\nlanguage; she thought she would take up the study of birds. But this\nprogram for a perfect life threatened to become so absurd that she very\nsoon caught herself out in the evil habit, and was rehearsing her\nspeech to the committee by the time the chestnut-colored bricks of\nRussell Square came in sight. Indeed, she never noticed them. She ran\nupstairs as usual, and was completely awakened to reality by the sight\nof Mrs. Seal, on the landing outside the office, inducing a very large\ndog to drink water out of a tumbler.\n\n\"Miss Markham has already arrived,\" Mrs. Seal remarked, with due\nsolemnity, \"and this is her dog.\"\n\n\"A very fine dog, too,\" said Mary, patting him on the head.\n\n\"Yes. A magnificent fellow,\" Mrs. Seal agreed. \"A kind of St. Bernard,\nshe tells me so like Kit to have a St. Bernard. And you guard your\nmistress well, don t you, Sailor? You see that wicked men don t break\ninto her larder when she s out at _her_ work helping poor souls who\nhave lost their way.... But we re late we must begin!\" and scattering\nthe rest of the water indiscriminately over the floor, she hurried Mary\ninto the committee-room.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIV\n\n\nMr. Clacton was in his glory. The machinery which he had perfected and\ncontrolled was now about to turn out its bi-monthly product, a\ncommittee meeting; and his pride in the perfect structure of these\nassemblies was great. He loved the jargon of committee-rooms; he loved\nthe way in which the door kept opening as the clock struck the hour, in\nobedience to a few strokes of his pen on a piece of paper; and when it\nhad opened sufficiently often, he loved to issue from his inner chamber\nwith documents in his hands, visibly important, with a preoccupied\nexpression on his face that might have suited a Prime Minister\nadvancing to meet his Cabinet. By his orders the table had been\ndecorated beforehand with six sheets of blotting-paper, with six pens,\nsix ink-pots, a tumbler and a jug of water, a bell, and, in deference\nto the taste of the lady members, a vase of hardy chrysanthemums. He\nhad already surreptitiously straightened the sheets of blotting-paper\nin relation to the ink-pots, and now stood in front of the fire engaged\nin conversation with Miss Markham. But his eye was on the door, and\nwhen Mary and Mrs. Seal entered, he gave a little laugh and observed to\nthe assembly which was scattered about the room:\n\n\"I fancy, ladies and gentlemen, that we are ready to commence.\"\n\nSo speaking, he took his seat at the head of the table, and arranging\none bundle of papers upon his right and another upon his left, called\nupon Miss Datchet to read the minutes of the previous meeting. Mary\nobeyed. A keen observer might have wondered why it was necessary for\nthe secretary to knit her brows so closely over the tolerably\nmatter-of-fact statement before her. Could there be any doubt in her\nmind that it had been resolved to circularize the provinces with\nLeaflet No. 3, or to issue a statistical diagram showing the proportion\nof married women to spinsters in New Zealand; or that the net profits\nof Mrs. Hipsley s Bazaar had reached a total of five pounds eight\nshillings and twopence half-penny?\n\nCould any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these\nstatements be disturbing her? No one could have guessed, from the look\nof her, that she was disturbed at all. A pleasanter and saner woman\nthan Mary Datchet was never seen within a committee-room. She seemed a\ncompound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine; less poetically\nspeaking, she showed both gentleness and strength, an indefinable\npromise of soft maternity blending with her evident fitness for honest\nlabor. Nevertheless, she had great difficulty in reducing her mind to\nobedience; and her reading lacked conviction, as if, as was indeed the\ncase, she had lost the power of visualizing what she read. And directly\nthe list was completed, her mind floated to Lincoln s Inn Fields and\nthe fluttering wings of innumerable sparrows. Was Ralph still enticing\nthe bald-headed cock-sparrow to sit upon his hand? Had he succeeded?\nWould he ever succeed? She had meant to ask him why it is that the\nsparrows in Lincoln s Inn Fields are tamer than the sparrows in Hyde\nPark perhaps it is that the passers-by are rarer, and they come to\nrecognize their benefactors. For the first half-hour of the committee\nmeeting, Mary had thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of\nRalph Denham, who threatened to have it all his own way. Mary tried\nhalf a dozen methods of ousting him. She raised her voice, she\narticulated distinctly, she looked firmly at Mr. Clacton s bald head,\nshe began to write a note. To her annoyance, her pencil drew a little\nround figure on the blotting-paper, which, she could not deny, was\nreally a bald-headed cock-sparrow. She looked again at Mr. Clacton;\nyes, he was bald, and so are cock-sparrows. Never was a secretary\ntormented by so many unsuitable suggestions, and they all came, alas!\nwith something ludicrously grotesque about them, which might, at any\nmoment, provoke her to such flippancy as would shock her colleagues for\never. The thought of what she might say made her bite her lips, as if\nher lips would protect her.\n\nBut all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to the\nsurface by a more profound disturbance, which, as she could not\nconsider it at present, manifested its existence by these grotesque\nnods and beckonings. Consider it, she must, when the committee was\nover. Meanwhile, she was behaving scandalously; she was looking out of\nthe window, and thinking of the color of the sky, and of the\ndecorations on the Imperial Hotel, when she ought to have been\nshepherding her colleagues, and pinning them down to the matter in\nhand. She could not bring herself to attach more weight to one project\nthan to another. Ralph had said she could not stop to consider what he\nhad said, but he had somehow divested the proceedings of all reality.\nAnd then, without conscious effort, by some trick of the brain, she\nfound herself becoming interested in some scheme for organizing a\nnewspaper campaign. Certain articles were to be written; certain\neditors approached. What line was it advisable to take? She found\nherself strongly disapproving of what Mr. Clacton was saying. She\ncommitted herself to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard.\nDirectly she had said this, she felt that she had turned upon Ralph s\nghost; and she became more and more in earnest, and anxious to bring\nthe others round to her point of view. Once more, she knew exactly and\nindisputably what is right and what is wrong. As if emerging from a\nmist, the old foes of the public good loomed ahead of her capitalists,\nnewspaper proprietors, anti-suffragists, and, in some ways most\npernicious of all, the masses who take no interest one way or\nanother among whom, for the time being, she certainly discerned the\nfeatures of Ralph Denham. Indeed, when Miss Markham asked her to\nsuggest the names of a few friends of hers, she expressed herself with\nunusual bitterness:\n\n\"My friends think all this kind of thing useless.\" She felt that she\nwas really saying that to Ralph himself.\n\n\"Oh, they re that sort, are they?\" said Miss Markham, with a little\nlaugh; and with renewed vigor their legions charged the foe.\n\nMary s spirits had been low when she entered the committee-room; but\nnow they were considerably improved. She knew the ways of this world;\nit was a shapely, orderly place; she felt convinced of its right and\nits wrong; and the feeling that she was fit to deal a heavy blow\nagainst her enemies warmed her heart and kindled her eye. In one of\nthose flights of fancy, not characteristic of her but tiresomely\nfrequent this afternoon, she envisaged herself battered with rotten\neggs upon a platform, from which Ralph vainly begged her to descend.\nBut \n\n\"What do I matter compared with the cause?\" she said, and so on. Much\nto her credit, however teased by foolish fancies, she kept the surface\nof her brain moderate and vigilant, and subdued Mrs. Seal very\ntactfully more than once when she demanded, \"Action! everywhere! at\nonce!\" as became her father s daughter.\n\nThe other members of the committee, who were all rather elderly people,\nwere a good deal impressed by Mary, and inclined to side with her and\nagainst each other, partly, perhaps, because of her youth. The feeling\nthat she controlled them all filled Mary with a sense of power; and she\nfelt that no work can equal in importance, or be so exciting as, the\nwork of making other people do what you want them to do. Indeed, when\nshe had won her point she felt a slight degree of contempt for the\npeople who had yielded to her.\n\nThe committee now rose, gathered together their papers, shook them\nstraight, placed them in their attache-cases, snapped the locks firmly\ntogether, and hurried away, having, for the most part, to catch trains,\nin order to keep other appointments with other committees, for they\nwere all busy people. Mary, Mrs. Seal, and Mr. Clacton were left alone;\nthe room was hot and untidy, the pieces of pink blotting-paper were\nlying at different angles upon the table, and the tumbler was half full\nof water, which some one had poured out and forgotten to drink.\n\nMrs. Seal began preparing the tea, while Mr. Clacton retired to his\nroom to file the fresh accumulation of documents. Mary was too much\nexcited even to help Mrs. Seal with the cups and saucers. She flung up\nthe window and stood by it, looking out. The street lamps were already\nlit; and through the mist in the square one could see little figures\nhurrying across the road and along the pavement, on the farther side.\nIn her absurd mood of lustful arrogance, Mary looked at the little\nfigures and thought, \"If I liked I could make you go in there or stop\nshort; I could make you walk in single file or in double file; I could\ndo what I liked with you.\" Then Mrs. Seal came and stood by her.\n\n\"Oughtn t you to put something round your shoulders, Sally?\" Mary\nasked, in rather a condescending tone of voice, feeling a sort of pity\nfor the enthusiastic ineffective little woman. But Mrs. Seal paid no\nattention to the suggestion.\n\n\"Well, did you enjoy yourself?\" Mary asked, with a little laugh.\n\nMrs. Seal drew a deep breath, restrained herself, and then burst out,\nlooking out, too, upon Russell Square and Southampton Row, and at the\npassers-by, \"Ah, if only one could get every one of those people into\nthis room, and make them understand for five minutes! But they _must_\nsee the truth some day.... If only one could _make_ them see it....\"\n\nMary knew herself to be very much wiser than Mrs. Seal, and when Mrs.\nSeal said anything, even if it was what Mary herself was feeling, she\nautomatically thought of all that there was to be said against it. On\nthis occasion her arrogant feeling that she could direct everybody\ndwindled away.\n\n\"Let s have our tea,\" she said, turning back from the window and\npulling down the blind. \"It was a good meeting didn t you think so,\nSally?\" she let fall, casually, as she sat down at the table. Surely\nMrs. Seal must realize that Mary had been extraordinarily efficient?\n\n\"But we go at such a snail s pace,\" said Sally, shaking her head\nimpatiently.\n\nAt this Mary burst out laughing, and all her arrogance was dissipated.\n\n\"You can afford to laugh,\" said Sally, with another shake of her head,\n\"but I can t. I m fifty-five, and I dare say I shall be in my grave by\nthe time we get it if we ever do.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you won t be in your grave,\" said Mary, kindly.\n\n\"It ll be such a great day,\" said Mrs. Seal, with a toss of her locks.\n\"A great day, not only for us, but for civilization. That s what I\nfeel, you know, about these meetings. Each one of them is a step\nonwards in the great march humanity, you know. We do want the people\nafter us to have a better time of it and so many don t see it. I wonder\nhow it is that they don t see it?\"\n\nShe was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke, so\nthat her sentences were more than usually broken apart. Mary could not\nhelp looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something\nlike admiration. While she had been thinking about herself, Mrs. Seal\nhad thought of nothing but her vision.\n\n\"You mustn t wear yourself out, Sally, if you want to see the great\nday,\" she said, rising and trying to take a plate of biscuits from Mrs.\nSeal s hands.\n\n\"My dear child, what else is my old body good for?\" she exclaimed,\nclinging more tightly than before to her plate of biscuits. \"Shouldn t\nI be proud to give everything I have to the cause? for I m not an\nintelligence like you. There were domestic circumstances I d like to\ntell you one of these days so I say foolish things. I lose my head, you\nknow. You don t. Mr. Clacton doesn t. It s a great mistake, to lose\none s head. But my heart s in the right place. And I m so glad Kit has\na big dog, for I didn t think her looking well.\"\n\nThey had their tea, and went over many of the points that had been\nraised in the committee rather more intimately than had been possible\nthen; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in some way behind\nthe scenes; of having their hands upon strings which, when pulled,\nwould completely change the pageant exhibited daily to those who read\nthe newspapers. Although their views were very different, this sense\nunited them and made them almost cordial in their manners to each\nother.\n\nMary, however, left the tea-party rather early, desiring both to be\nalone, and then to hear some music at the Queen s Hall. She fully\nintended to use her loneliness to think out her position with regard to\nRalph; but although she walked back to the Strand with this end in\nview, she found her mind uncomfortably full of different trains of\nthought. She started one and then another. They seemed even to take\ntheir color from the street she happened to be in. Thus the vision of\nhumanity appeared to be in some way connected with Bloomsbury, and\nfaded distinctly by the time she crossed the main road; then a belated\norgan-grinder in Holborn set her thoughts dancing incongruously; and by\nthe time she was crossing the great misty square of Lincoln s Inn\nFields, she was cold and depressed again, and horribly clear-sighted.\nThe dark removed the stimulus of human companionship, and a tear\nactually slid down her cheek, accompanying a sudden conviction within\nher that she loved Ralph, and that he didn t love her. All dark and\nempty now was the path where they had walked that morning, and the\nsparrows silent in the bare trees. But the lights in her own building\nsoon cheered her; all these different states of mind were submerged in\nthe deep flood of desires, thoughts, perceptions, antagonisms, which\nwashed perpetually at the base of her being, to rise into prominence in\nturn when the conditions of the upper world were favorable. She put off\nthe hour of clear thought until Christmas, saying to herself, as she\nlit her fire, that it is impossible to think anything out in London;\nand, no doubt, Ralph wouldn t come at Christmas, and she would take\nlong walks into the heart of the country, and decide this question and\nall the others that puzzled her. Meanwhile, she thought, drawing her\nfeet up on to the fender, life was full of complexity; life was a thing\none must love to the last fiber of it.\n\nShe had sat there for five minutes or so, and her thoughts had had time\nto grow dim, when there came a ring at her bell. Her eye brightened;\nshe felt immediately convinced that Ralph had come to visit her.\nAccordingly, she waited a moment before opening the door; she wanted to\nfeel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions\nwhich the sight of Ralph would certainly arouse. She composed herself\nunnecessarily, however, for she had to admit, not Ralph, but Katharine\nand William Rodney. Her first impression was that they were both\nextremely well dressed. She felt herself shabby and slovenly beside\nthem, and did not know how she should entertain them, nor could she\nguess why they had come. She had heard nothing of their engagement. But\nafter the first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly\nthat Katharine was a personality, and, moreover, she need not now\nexercise her self-control.\n\n\"We were passing and saw a light in your window, so we came up,\"\nKatharine explained, standing and looking very tall and distinguished\nand rather absent-minded.\n\n\"We have been to see some pictures,\" said William. \"Oh, dear,\" he\nexclaimed, looking about him, \"this room reminds me of one of the worst\nhours in my existence when I read a paper, and you all sat round and\njeered at me. Katharine was the worst. I could feel her gloating over\nevery mistake I made. Miss Datchet was kind. Miss Datchet just made it\npossible for me to get through, I remember.\"\n\nSitting down, he drew off his light yellow gloves, and began slapping\nhis knees with them. His vitality was pleasant, Mary thought, although\nhe made her laugh. The very look of him was inclined to make her laugh.\nHis rather prominent eyes passed from one young woman to the other, and\nhis lips perpetually formed words which remained unspoken.\n\n\"We have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery,\" said\nKatharine, apparently paying no attention to William, and accepting a\ncigarette which Mary offered her. She leant back in her chair, and the\nsmoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her still further\nfrom the others.\n\n\"Would you believe it, Miss Datchet,\" William continued, \"Katharine\ndoesn t like Titian. She doesn t like apricots, she doesn t like\npeaches, she doesn t like green peas. She likes the Elgin marbles, and\ngray days without any sun. She s a typical example of the cold northern\nnature. I come from Devonshire \"\n\nHad they been quarreling, Mary wondered, and had they, for that reason,\nsought refuge in her room, or were they engaged, or had Katharine just\nrefused him? She was completely baffled.\n\nKatharine now reappeared from her veil of smoke, knocked the ash from\nher cigarette into the fireplace, and looked, with an odd expression of\nsolicitude, at the irritable man.\n\n\"Perhaps, Mary,\" she said tentatively, \"you wouldn t mind giving us\nsome tea? We did try to get some, but the shop was so crowded, and in\nthe next one there was a band playing; and most of the pictures, at any\nrate, were very dull, whatever you may say, William.\" She spoke with a\nkind of guarded gentleness.\n\nMary, accordingly, retired to make preparations in the pantry.\n\n\"What in the world are they after?\" she asked of her own reflection in\nthe little looking-glass which hung there. She was not left to doubt\nmuch longer, for, on coming back into the sitting-room with the\ntea-things, Katharine informed her, apparently having been instructed\nso to do by William, of their engagement.\n\n\"William,\" she said, \"thinks that perhaps you don t know. We are going\nto be married.\"\n\nMary found herself shaking William s hand, and addressing her\ncongratulations to him, as if Katharine were inaccessible; she had,\nindeed, taken hold of the tea-kettle.\n\n\"Let me see,\" Katharine said, \"one puts hot water into the cups first,\ndoesn t one? You have some dodge of your own, haven t you, William,\nabout making tea?\"\n\nMary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order to\nconceal nervousness, but if so, the concealment was unusually perfect.\nTalk of marriage was dismissed. Katharine might have been seated in her\nown drawing-room, controlling a situation which presented no sort of\ndifficulty to her trained mind. Rather to her surprise, Mary found\nherself making conversation with William about old Italian pictures,\nwhile Katharine poured out tea, cut cake, kept William s plate\nsupplied, without joining more than was necessary in the conversation.\nShe seemed to have taken possession of Mary s room, and to handle the\ncups as if they belonged to her. But it was done so naturally that it\nbred no resentment in Mary; on the contrary, she found herself putting\nher hand on Katharine s knee, affectionately, for an instant. Was there\nsomething maternal in this assumption of control? And thinking of\nKatharine as one who would soon be married, these maternal airs filled\nMary s mind with a new tenderness, and even with awe. Katharine seemed\nvery much older and more experienced than she was.\n\nMeanwhile Rodney talked. If his appearance was superficially against\nhim, it had the advantage of making his solid merits something of a\nsurprise. He had kept notebooks; he knew a great deal about pictures.\nHe could compare different examples in different galleries, and his\nauthoritative answers to intelligent questions gained not a little,\nMary felt, from the smart taps which he dealt, as he delivered them,\nupon the lumps of coal. She was impressed.\n\n\"Your tea, William,\" said Katharine gently.\n\nHe paused, gulped it down, obediently, and continued.\n\nAnd then it struck Mary that Katharine, in the shade of her\nbroad-brimmed hat, and in the midst of the smoke, and in the obscurity\nof her character, was, perhaps, smiling to herself, not altogether in\nthe maternal spirit. What she said was very simple, but her words, even\n\"Your tea, William,\" were set down as gently and cautiously and exactly\nas the feet of a Persian cat stepping among China ornaments. For the\nsecond time that day Mary felt herself baffled by something inscrutable\nin the character of a person to whom she felt herself much attracted.\nShe thought that if she were engaged to Katharine, she, too, would find\nherself very soon using those fretful questions with which William\nevidently teased his bride. And yet Katharine s voice was humble.\n\n\"I wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as well as\nbooks?\" she asked.\n\n\"How do I find the time?\" William answered, delighted, Mary guessed, at\nthis little compliment. \"Why, I always travel with a notebook. And I\nask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning.\nAnd then I meet men, and talk to them. There s a man in my office who\nknows all about the Flemish school. I was telling Miss Datchet about\nthe Flemish school. I picked up a lot of it from him it s a way men\nhave Gibbons, his name is. You must meet him. We ll ask him to lunch.\nAnd this not caring about art,\" he explained, turning to Mary, \"it s\none of Katharine s poses, Miss Datchet. Did you know she posed? She\npretends that she s never read Shakespeare. And why should she read\nShakespeare, since she IS Shakespeare Rosalind, you know,\" and he gave\nhis queer little chuckle. Somehow this compliment appeared very\nold-fashioned and almost in bad taste. Mary actually felt herself\nblush, as if he had said \"the sex\" or \"the ladies.\" Constrained,\nperhaps, by nervousness, Rodney continued in the same vein.\n\n\"She knows enough enough for all decent purposes. What do you women\nwant with learning, when you have so much else everything, I should\nsay everything. Leave us something, eh, Katharine?\"\n\n\"Leave you something?\" said Katharine, apparently waking from a brown\nstudy. \"I was thinking we must be going \"\n\n\"Is it to-night that Lady Ferrilby dines with us? No, we mustn t be\nlate,\" said Rodney, rising. \"D you know the Ferrilbys, Miss Datchet?\nThey own Trantem Abbey,\" he added, for her information, as she looked\ndoubtful. \"And if Katharine makes herself very charming to-night,\nperhaps ll lend it to us for the honeymoon.\"\n\n\"I agree that may be a reason. Otherwise she s a dull woman,\" said\nKatharine. \"At least,\" she added, as if to qualify her abruptness, \"I\nfind it difficult to talk to her.\"\n\n\"Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble. I ve seen\nher sit silent a whole evening,\" he said, turning to Mary, as he had\nfrequently done already. \"Don t you find that, too? Sometimes when\nwe re alone, I ve counted the time on my watch\" here he took out a\nlarge gold watch, and tapped the glass \"the time between one remark and\nthe next. And once I counted ten minutes and twenty seconds, and then,\nif you ll believe me, she only said  Um! \"\n\n\"I m sure I m sorry,\" Katharine apologized. \"I know it s a bad habit,\nbut then, you see, at home \"\n\nThe rest of her excuse was cut short, so far as Mary was concerned, by\nthe closing of the door. She fancied she could hear William finding\nfresh fault on the stairs. A moment later, the door-bell rang again,\nand Katharine reappeared, having left her purse on a chair. She soon\nfound it, and said, pausing for a moment at the door, and speaking\ndifferently as they were alone:\n\n\"I think being engaged is very bad for the character.\" She shook her\npurse in her hand until the coins jingled, as if she alluded merely to\nthis example of her forgetfulness. But the remark puzzled Mary; it\nseemed to refer to something else; and her manner had changed so\nstrangely, now that William was out of hearing, that she could not help\nlooking at her for an explanation. She looked almost stern, so that\nMary, trying to smile at her, only succeeded in producing a silent\nstare of interrogation.\n\nAs the door shut for the second time, she sank on to the floor in front\nof the fire, trying, now that their bodies were not there to distract\nher, to piece together her impressions of them as a whole. And, though\npriding herself, with all other men and women, upon an infallible eye\nfor character, she could not feel at all certain that she knew what\nmotives inspired Katharine Hilbery in life. There was something that\ncarried her on smoothly, out of reach something, yes, but\nwhat? something that reminded Mary of Ralph. Oddly enough, he gave her\nthe same feeling, too, and with him, too, she felt baffled. Oddly\nenough, for no two people, she hastily concluded, were more unlike. And\nyet both had this hidden impulse, this incalculable force this thing\nthey cared for and didn t talk about oh, what was it?\n\n",

        "raw text": " XV\n\n\nThe village of Disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of cultivated\nground in the neighborhood of Lincoln, not so far inland but that a\nsound, bringing rumors of the sea, can be heard on summer nights or\nwhen the winter storms fling the waves upon the long beach. So large is\nthe church, and in particular the church tower, in comparison with the\nlittle street of cottages which compose the village, that the traveler\nis apt to cast his mind back to the Middle Ages, as the only time when\nso much piety could have been kept alive. So great a trust in the\nChurch can surely not belong to our day, and he goes on to conjecture\nthat every one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human\nlife. Such are the reflections of the superficial stranger, and his\nsight of the population, as it is represented by two or three men\nhoeing in a turnip-field, a small child carrying a jug, and a young\nwoman shaking a piece of carpet outside her cottage door, will not lead\nhim to see anything very much out of keeping with the Middle Ages in\nthe village of Disham as it is to-day. These people, though they seem\nyoung enough, look so angular and so crude that they remind him of the\nlittle pictures painted by monks in the capital letters of their\nmanuscripts. He only half understands what they say, and speaks very\nloud and clearly, as though, indeed, his voice had to carry through a\nhundred years or more before it reached them. He would have a far\nbetter chance of understanding some dweller in Paris or Rome, Berlin or\nMadrid, than these countrymen of his who have lived for the last two\nthousand years not two hundred miles from the City of London.\n\nThe Rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village. It is a large\nhouse, and has been growing steadily for some centuries round the great\nkitchen, with its narrow red tiles, as the Rector would point out to\nhis guests on the first night of their arrival, taking his brass\ncandlestick, and bidding them mind the steps up and the steps down, and\nnotice the immense thickness of the walls, the old beams across the\nceiling, the staircases as steep as ladders, and the attics, with their\ndeep, tent-like roofs, in which swallows bred, and once a white owl.\nBut nothing very interesting or very beautiful had resulted from the\ndifferent additions made by the different rectors.\n\nThe house, however, was surrounded by a garden, in which the Rector\ntook considerable pride. The lawn, which fronted the drawing-room\nwindows, was a rich and uniform green, unspotted by a single daisy, and\non the other side of it two straight paths led past beds of tall,\nstanding flowers to a charming grassy walk, where the Rev. Wyndham\nDatchet would pace up and down at the same hour every morning, with a\nsundial to measure the time for him. As often as not, he carried a book\nin his hand, into which he would glance, then shut it up, and repeat\nthe rest of the ode from memory. He had most of Horace by heart, and\nhad got into the habit of connecting this particular walk with certain\nodes which he repeated duly, at the same time noting the condition of\nhis flowers, and stooping now and again to pick any that were withered\nor overblown. On wet days, such was the power of habit over him, he\nrose from his chair at the same hour, and paced his study for the same\nlength of time, pausing now and then to straighten some book in the\nbookcase, or alter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing\nupon cairns of serpentine stone upon the mantelpiece. His children had\na great respect for him, credited him with far more learning than he\nactually possessed, and saw that his habits were not interfered with,\nif possible. Like most people who do things methodically, the Rector\nhimself had more strength of purpose and power of self-sacrifice than\nof intellect or of originality. On cold and windy nights he rode off to\nvisit sick people, who might need him, without a murmur; and by virtue\nof doing dull duties punctually, he was much employed upon committees\nand local Boards and Councils; and at this period of his life (he was\nsixty-eight) he was beginning to be commiserated by tender old ladies\nfor the extreme leanness of his person, which, they said, was worn out\nupon the roads when it should have been resting before a comfortable\nfire. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, lived with him and managed the\nhouse, and already much resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical\nhabit of mind; of the two sons one, Richard, was an estate agent, the\nother, Christopher, was reading for the Bar. At Christmas, naturally,\nthey met together; and for a month past the arrangement of the\nChristmas week had been much in the mind of mistress and maid, who\nprided themselves every year more confidently upon the excellence of\ntheir equipment. The late Mrs. Datchet had left an excellent cupboard\nof linen, to which Elizabeth had succeeded at the age of nineteen, when\nher mother died, and the charge of the family rested upon the shoulders\nof the eldest daughter. She kept a fine flock of yellow chickens,\nsketched a little, certain rose-trees in the garden were committed\nspecially to her care; and what with the care of the house, the care of\nthe chickens, and the care of the poor, she scarcely knew what it was\nto have an idle minute. An extreme rectitude of mind, rather than any\ngift, gave her weight in the family. When Mary wrote to say that she\nhad asked Ralph Denham to stay with them, she added, out of deference\nto Elizabeth s character, that he was very nice, though rather queer,\nand had been overworking himself in London. No doubt Elizabeth would\nconclude that Ralph was in love with her, but there could be no doubt\neither that not a word of this would be spoken by either of them,\nunless, indeed, some catastrophe made mention of it unavoidable.\n\nMary went down to Disham without knowing whether Ralph intended to\ncome; but two or three days before Christmas she received a telegram\nfrom Ralph, asking her to take a room for him in the village. This was\nfollowed by a letter explaining that he hoped he might have his meals\nwith them; but quiet, essential for his work, made it necessary to\nsleep out.\n\nMary was walking in the garden with Elizabeth, and inspecting the\nroses, when the letter arrived.\n\n\"But that s absurd,\" said Elizabeth decidedly, when the plan was\nexplained to her. \"There are five spare rooms, even when the boys are\nhere. Besides, he wouldn t get a room in the village. And he oughtn t\nto work if he s overworked.\"\n\n\"But perhaps he doesn t want to see so much of us,\" Mary thought to\nherself, although outwardly she assented, and felt grateful to\nElizabeth for supporting her in what was, of course, her desire. They\nwere cutting roses at the time, and laying them, head by head, in a\nshallow basket.\n\n\"If Ralph were here, he d find this very dull,\" Mary thought, with a\nlittle shiver of irritation, which led her to place her rose the wrong\nway in the basket. Meanwhile, they had come to the end of the path, and\nwhile Elizabeth straightened some flowers, and made them stand upright\nwithin their fence of string, Mary looked at her father, who was pacing\nup and down, with his hand behind his back and his head bowed in\nmeditation. Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to\ninterrupt this methodical marching, Mary stepped on to the grass walk\nand put her hand on his arm.\n\n\"A flower for your buttonhole, father,\" she said, presenting a rose.\n\n\"Eh, dear?\" said Mr. Datchet, taking the flower, and holding it at an\nangle which suited his bad eyesight, without pausing in his walk.\n\n\"Where does this fellow come from? One of Elizabeth s roses I hope you\nasked her leave. Elizabeth doesn t like having her roses picked without\nher leave, and quite right, too.\"\n\nHe had a habit, Mary remarked, and she had never noticed it so clearly\nbefore, of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous murmur,\nwhereupon he passed into a state of abstraction, presumed by his\nchildren to indicate some train of thought too profound for utterance.\n\n\"What?\" said Mary, interrupting, for the first time in her life,\nperhaps, when the murmur ceased. He made no reply. She knew very well\nthat he wished to be left alone, but she stuck to his side much as she\nmight have stuck to some sleep-walker, whom she thought it right\ngradually to awaken. She could think of nothing to rouse him with\nexcept:\n\n\"The garden s looking very nice, father.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said Mr. Datchet, running his words together in the\nsame abstracted manner, and sinking his head yet lower upon his breast.\nAnd suddenly, as they turned their steps to retrace their way, he\njerked out:\n\n\"The traffic s very much increased, you know. More rolling-stock needed\nalready. Forty trucks went down yesterday by the 12.15 counted them\nmyself. They ve taken off the 9.3, and given us an 8.30 instead suits\nthe business men, you know. You came by the old 3.10 yesterday, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nShe said \"Yes,\" as he seemed to wish for a reply, and then he looked at\nhis watch, and made off down the path towards the house, holding the\nrose at the same angle in front of him. Elizabeth had gone round to the\nside of the house, where the chickens lived, so that Mary found herself\nalone, holding Ralph s letter in her hand. She was uneasy. She had put\noff the season for thinking things out very successfully, and now that\nRalph was actually coming, the next day, she could only wonder how her\nfamily would impress him. She thought it likely that her father would\ndiscuss the train service with him; Elizabeth would be bright and\nsensible, and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants.\nHer brothers had already said that they would give him a day s\nshooting. She was content to leave the problem of Ralph s relations to\nthe young men obscure, trusting that they would find some common ground\nof masculine agreement. But what would he think of _her?_ Would he see\nthat she was different from the rest of the family? She devised a plan\nfor taking him to her sitting-room, and artfully leading the talk\ntowards the English poets, who now occupied prominent places in her\nlittle bookcase. Moreover, she might give him to understand, privately,\nthat she, too, thought her family a queer one queer, yes, but not dull.\nThat was the rock past which she was bent on steering him. And she\nthought how she would draw his attention to Edward s passion for\nJorrocks, and the enthusiasm which led Christopher to collect moths and\nbutterflies though he was now twenty-two. Perhaps Elizabeth s\nsketching, if the fruits were invisible, might lend color to the\ngeneral effect which she wished to produce of a family, eccentric and\nlimited, perhaps, but not dull. Edward, she perceived, was rolling the\nlawn, for the sake of exercise; and the sight of him, with pink cheeks,\nbright little brown eyes, and a general resemblance to a clumsy young\ncart-horse in its winter coat of dusty brown hair, made Mary violently\nashamed of her ambitious scheming. She loved him precisely as he was;\nshe loved them all; and as she walked by his side, up and down, and\ndown and up, her strong moral sense administered a sound drubbing to\nthe vain and romantic element aroused in her by the mere thought of\nRalph. She felt quite certain that, for good or for bad, she was very\nlike the rest of her family.\n\nSitting in the corner of a third-class railway carriage, on the\nafternoon of the following day, Ralph made several inquiries of a\ncommercial traveler in the opposite corner. They centered round a\nvillage called Lampsher, not three miles, he understood, from Lincoln;\nwas there a big house in Lampsher, he asked, inhabited by a gentleman\nof the name of Otway?\n\nThe traveler knew nothing, but rolled the name of Otway on his tongue,\nreflectively, and the sound of it gratified Ralph amazingly. It gave\nhim an excuse to take a letter from his pocket in order to verify the\naddress.\n\n\"Stogdon House, Lampsher, Lincoln,\" he read out.\n\n\"You ll find somebody to direct you at Lincoln,\" said the man; and\nRalph had to confess that he was not bound there this very evening.\n\n\"I ve got to walk over from Disham,\" he said, and in the heart of him\ncould not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived from making a\nbagman in a train believe what he himself did not believe. For the\nletter, though signed by Katharine s father, contained no invitation or\nwarrant for thinking that Katharine herself was there; the only fact it\ndisclosed was that for a fortnight this address would be Mr. Hilbery s\naddress. But when he looked out of the window, it was of her he\nthought; she, too, had seen these gray fields, and, perhaps, she was\nthere where the trees ran up a slope, and one yellow light shone now,\nand then went out again, at the foot of the hill. The light shone in\nthe windows of an old gray house, he thought. He lay back in his corner\nand forgot the commercial traveler altogether. The process of\nvisualizing Katharine stopped short at the old gray manor-house;\ninstinct warned him that if he went much further with this process\nreality would soon force itself in; he could not altogether neglect the\nfigure of William Rodney. Since the day when he had heard from\nKatharine s lips of her engagement, he had refrained from investing his\ndream of her with the details of real life. But the light of the late\nafternoon glowed green behind the straight trees, and became a symbol\nof her. The light seemed to expand his heart. She brooded over the gray\nfields, and was with him now in the railway carriage, thoughtful,\nsilent, and infinitely tender; but the vision pressed too close, and\nmust be dismissed, for the train was slackening. Its abrupt jerks shook\nhim wide awake, and he saw Mary Datchet, a sturdy russet figure, with a\ndash of scarlet about it, as the carriage slid down the platform. A\ntall youth who accompanied her shook him by the hand, took his bag, and\nled the way without uttering one articulate word.\n\nNever are voices so beautiful as on a winter s evening, when dusk\nalmost hides the body, and they seem to issue from nothingness with a\nnote of intimacy seldom heard by day. Such an edge was there in Mary s\nvoice when she greeted him. About her seemed to hang the mist of the\nwinter hedges, and the clear red of the bramble leaves. He felt himself\nat once stepping on to the firm ground of an entirely different world,\nbut he did not allow himself to yield to the pleasure of it directly.\nThey gave him his choice of driving with Edward or of walking home\nacross the fields with Mary not a shorter way, they explained, but Mary\nthought it a nicer way. He decided to walk with her, being conscious,\nindeed, that he got comfort from her presence. What could be the cause\nof her cheerfulness, he wondered, half ironically, and half enviously,\nas the pony-cart started briskly away, and the dusk swam between their\neyes and the tall form of Edward, standing up to drive, with the reins\nin one hand and the whip in the other. People from the village, who had\nbeen to the market town, were climbing into their gigs, or setting off\nhome down the road together in little parties. Many salutations were\naddressed to Mary, who shouted back, with the addition of the speaker s\nname. But soon she led the way over a stile, and along a path worn\nslightly darker than the dim green surrounding it. In front of them the\nsky now showed itself of a reddish-yellow, like a slice of some\nsemilucent stone behind which a lamp burnt, while a fringe of black\ntrees with distinct branches stood against the light, which was\nobscured in one direction by a hump of earth, in all other directions\nthe land lying flat to the very verge of the sky. One of the swift and\nnoiseless birds of the winter s night seemed to follow them across the\nfield, circling a few feet in front of them, disappearing and returning\nagain and again.\n\nMary had gone this walk many hundred times in the course of her life,\ngenerally alone, and at different stages the ghosts of past moods would\nflood her mind with a whole scene or train of thought merely at the\nsight of three trees from a particular angle, or at the sound of the\npheasant clucking in the ditch. But to-night the circumstances were\nstrong enough to oust all other scenes; and she looked at the field and\nthe trees with an involuntary intensity as if they had no such\nassociations for her.\n\n\"Well, Ralph,\" she said, \"this is better than Lincoln s Inn Fields,\nisn t it? Look, there s a bird for you! Oh, you ve brought glasses,\nhave you? Edward and Christopher mean to make you shoot. Can you shoot?\nI shouldn t think so \"\n\n\"Look here, you must explain,\" said Ralph. \"Who are these young men?\nWhere am I staying?\"\n\n\"You are staying with us, of course,\" she said boldly. \"Of course,\nyou re staying with us you don t mind coming, do you?\"\n\n\"If I had, I shouldn t have come,\" he said sturdily. They walked on in\nsilence; Mary took care not to break it for a time. She wished Ralph to\nfeel, as she thought he would, all the fresh delights of the earth and\nair. She was right. In a moment he expressed his pleasure, much to her\ncomfort.\n\n\"This is the sort of country I thought you d live in, Mary,\" he said,\npushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him. \"Real country.\nNo gentlemen s seats.\"\n\nHe snuffed the air, and felt more keenly than he had done for many\nweeks the pleasure of owning a body.\n\n\"Now we have to find our way through a hedge,\" said Mary. In the gap of\nthe hedge Ralph tore up a poacher s wire, set across a hole to trap a\nrabbit.\n\n\"It s quite right that they should poach,\" said Mary, watching him\ntugging at the wire. \"I wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins or Sid\nRankin? How can one expect them not to, when they only make fifteen\nshillings a week? Fifteen shillings a week,\" she repeated, coming out\non the other side of the hedge, and running her fingers through her\nhair to rid herself of a bramble which had attached itself to her. \"I\ncould live on fifteen shillings a week easily.\"\n\n\"Could you?\" said Ralph. \"I don t believe you could,\" he added.\n\n\"Oh yes. They have a cottage thrown in, and a garden where one can grow\nvegetables. It wouldn t be half bad,\" said Mary, with a soberness which\nimpressed Ralph very much.\n\n\"But you d get tired of it,\" he urged.\n\n\"I sometimes think it s the only thing one would never get tired of,\"\nshe replied.\n\nThe idea of a cottage where one grew one s own vegetables and lived on\nfifteen shillings a week, filled Ralph with an extraordinary sense of\nrest and satisfaction.\n\n\"But wouldn t it be on the main road, or next door to a woman with six\nsqualling children, who d always be hanging her washing out to dry\nacross your garden?\"\n\n\"The cottage I m thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard.\"\n\n\"And what about the Suffrage?\" he asked, attempting sarcasm.\n\n\"Oh, there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage,\" she\nreplied, in an off-hand manner which was slightly mysterious.\n\nRalph fell silent. It annoyed him that she should have plans of which\nhe knew nothing; but he felt that he had no right to press her further.\nHis mind settled upon the idea of life in a country cottage.\nConceivably, for he could not examine into it now, here lay a\ntremendous possibility; a solution of many problems. He struck his\nstick upon the earth, and stared through the dusk at the shape of the\ncountry.\n\n\"D you know the points of the compass?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, of course,\" said Mary. \"What d you take me for? a Cockney like\nyou?\" She then told him exactly where the north lay, and where the\nsouth.\n\n\"It s my native land, this,\" she said. \"I could smell my way about it\nblindfold.\"\n\nAs if to prove this boast, she walked a little quicker, so that Ralph\nfound it difficult to keep pace with her. At the same time, he felt\ndrawn to her as he had never been before; partly, no doubt, because she\nwas more independent of him than in London, and seemed to be attached\nfirmly to a world where he had no place at all. Now the dusk had fallen\nto such an extent that he had to follow her implicitly, and even lean\nhis hand on her shoulder when they jumped a bank into a very narrow\nlane. And he felt curiously shy of her when she began to shout through\nher hands at a spot of light which swung upon the mist in a neighboring\nfield. He shouted, too, and the light stood still.\n\n\"That s Christopher, come in already, and gone to feed his chickens,\"\nshe said.\n\nShe introduced him to Ralph, who could see only a tall figure in\ngaiters, rising from a fluttering circle of soft feathery bodies, upon\nwhom the light fell in wavering discs, calling out now a bright spot of\nyellow, now one of greenish-black and scarlet. Mary dipped her hand in\nthe bucket he carried, and was at once the center of a circle also; and\nas she cast her grain she talked alternately to the birds and to her\nbrother, in the same clucking, half-inarticulate voice, as it sounded\nto Ralph, standing on the outskirts of the fluttering feathers in his\nblack overcoat.\n\nHe had removed his overcoat by the time they sat round the\ndinner-table, but nevertheless he looked very strange among the others.\nA country life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which Mary\nhesitated to call either innocent or youthful, as she compared them,\nnow sitting round in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight; and\nyet it was something of the kind, yes, even in the case of the Rector\nhimself. Though superficially marked with lines, his face was a clear\npink, and his blue eyes had the long-sighted, peaceful expression of\neyes seeking the turn of the road, or a distant light through rain, or\nthe darkness of winter. She looked at Ralph. He had never appeared to\nher more concentrated and full of purpose; as if behind his forehead\nwere massed so much experience that he could choose for himself which\npart of it he would display and which part he would keep to himself.\nCompared with that dark and stern countenance, her brothers  faces,\nbending low over their soup-plates, were mere circles of pink, unmolded\nflesh.\n\n\"You came by the 3.10, Mr. Denham?\" said the Reverend Wyndham Datchet,\ntucking his napkin into his collar, so that almost the whole of his\nbody was concealed by a large white diamond. \"They treat us very well,\non the whole. Considering the increase of traffic, they treat us very\nwell indeed. I have the curiosity sometimes to count the trucks on the\ngoods  trains, and they re well over fifty well over fifty, at this\nseason of the year.\"\n\nThe old gentleman had been roused agreeably by the presence of this\nattentive and well-informed young man, as was evident by the care with\nwhich he finished the last words in his sentences, and his slight\nexaggeration in the number of trucks on the trains. Indeed, the chief\nburden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained it to-night in a\nmanner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then;\nfor they felt shy of Denham, and were glad not to have to talk\nthemselves. The store of information about the present and past of this\nparticular corner of Lincolnshire which old Mr. Datchet produced really\nsurprised his children, for though they knew of its existence, they had\nforgotten its extent, as they might have forgotten the amount of family\nplate stored in the plate-chest, until some rare celebration brought it\nforth.\n\nAfter dinner, parish business took the Rector to his study, and Mary\nproposed that they should sit in the kitchen.\n\n\"It s not the kitchen really,\" Elizabeth hastened to explain to her\nguest, \"but we call it so \"\n\n\"It s the nicest room in the house,\" said Edward.\n\n\"It s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace, where the men\nhung their guns,\" said Elizabeth, leading the way, with a tall brass\ncandlestick in her hand, down a passage. \"Show Mr. Denham the steps,\nChristopher.... When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were here two\nyears ago they said this was the most interesting part of the house.\nThese narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred years old five\nhundred years, I think they may have said six.\" She, too, felt an\nimpulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks, as her father had\nexaggerated the number of trucks. A big lamp hung down from the center\nof the ceiling and, together with a fine log fire, illuminated a large\nand lofty room, with rafters running from wall to wall, a floor of red\ntiles, and a substantial fireplace built up of those narrow red bricks\nwhich were said to be five hundred years old. A few rugs and a\nsprinkling of arm-chairs had made this ancient kitchen into a\nsitting-room. Elizabeth, after pointing out the gun-racks, and the\nhooks for smoking hams, and other evidence of incontestable age, and\nexplaining that Mary had had the idea of turning the room into a\nsitting-room otherwise it was used for hanging out the wash and for the\nmen to change in after shooting considered that she had done her duty\nas hostess, and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp,\nbeside a very long and narrow oak table. She placed a pair of horn\nspectacles upon her nose, and drew towards her a basketful of threads\nand wools. In a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained\nthere for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"Will you come out shooting with us to-morrow?\" said Christopher, who\nhad, on the whole, formed a favorable impression of his sister s\nfriend.\n\n\"I won t shoot, but I ll come with you,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Don t you care about shooting?\" asked Edward, whose suspicions were\nnot yet laid to rest.\n\n\"I ve never shot in my life,\" said Ralph, turning and looking him in\nthe face, because he was not sure how this confession would be\nreceived.\n\n\"You wouldn t have much chance in London, I suppose,\" said Christopher.\n\"But won t you find it rather dull just watching us?\"\n\n\"I shall watch birds,\" Ralph replied, with a smile.\n\n\"I can show you the place for watching birds,\" said Edward, \"if that s\nwhat you like doing. I know a fellow who comes down from London about\nthis time every year to watch them. It s a great place for the wild\ngeese and the ducks. I ve heard this man say that it s one of the best\nplaces for birds in the country.\"\n\n\"It s about the best place in England,\" Ralph replied. They were all\ngratified by this praise of their native county; and Mary now had the\npleasure of hearing these short questions and answers lose their\nundertone of suspicious inspection, so far as her brothers were\nconcerned, and develop into a genuine conversation about the habits of\nbirds which afterwards turned to a discussion as to the habits of\nsolicitors, in which it was scarcely necessary for her to take part.\nShe was pleased to see that her brothers liked Ralph, to the extent,\nthat is, of wishing to secure his good opinion. Whether or not he liked\nthem it was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner.\nNow and then she fed the fire with a fresh log, and as the room filled\nwith the fine, dry heat of burning wood, they all, with the exception\nof Elizabeth, who was outside the range of the fire, felt less and less\nanxious about the effect they were making, and more and more inclined\nfor sleep. At this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the door.\n\n\"Piper! oh, damn! I shall have to get up,\" murmured Christopher.\n\n\"It s not Piper, it s Pitch,\" Edward grunted.\n\n\"All the same, I shall have to get up,\" Christopher grumbled. He let in\nthe dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened into the\ngarden, to revive himself with a draught of the black, starlit air.\n\n\"Do come in and shut the door!\" Mary cried, half turning in her chair.\n\n\"We shall have a fine day to-morrow,\" said Christopher with\ncomplacency, and he sat himself on the floor at her feet, and leant his\nback against her knees, and stretched out his long stockinged legs to\nthe fire all signs that he felt no longer any restraint at the presence\nof the stranger. He was the youngest of the family, and Mary s\nfavorite, partly because his character resembled hers, as Edward s\ncharacter resembled Elizabeth s. She made her knees a comfortable rest\nfor his head, and ran her fingers through his hair.\n\n\"I should like Mary to stroke my head like that,\" Ralph thought to\nhimself suddenly, and he looked at Christopher, almost affectionately,\nfor calling forth his sister s caresses. Instantly he thought of\nKatharine, the thought of her being surrounded by the spaces of night\nand the open air; and Mary, watching him, saw the lines upon his\nforehead suddenly deepen. He stretched out an arm and placed a log upon\nthe fire, constraining himself to fit it carefully into the frail red\nscaffolding, and also to limit his thoughts to this one room.\n\nMary had ceased to stroke her brother s head; he moved it impatiently\nbetween her knees, and, much as though he were a child, she began once\nmore to part the thick, reddish-colored locks this way and that. But a\nfar stronger passion had taken possession of her soul than any her\nbrother could inspire in her, and, seeing Ralph s change of expression,\nher hand almost automatically continued its movements, while her mind\nplunged desperately for some hold upon slippery banks.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XVI\n\n\nInto that same black night, almost, indeed, into the very same layer of\nstarlit air, Katharine Hilbery was now gazing, although not with a view\nto the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow. She was\nwalking up and down a gravel path in the garden of Stogdon House, her\nsight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless\nhoops of a pergola. Thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure\nCassiopeia, or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the\nMilky Way. At the end of the pergola, however, there was a stone seat,\nfrom which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly\ninterruption, save to the right, indeed, where a line of elm-trees was\nbeautifully sprinkled with stars, and a low stable building had a full\ndrop of quivering silver just issuing from the mouth of the chimney. It\nwas a moonless night, but the light of the stars was sufficient to show\nthe outline of the young woman s form, and the shape of her face gazing\ngravely, indeed almost sternly, into the sky. She had come out into the\nwinter s night, which was mild enough, not so much to look with\nscientific eyes upon the stars, as to shake herself free from certain\npurely terrestrial discontents. Much as a literary person in like\ncircumstances would begin, absent-mindedly, pulling out volume after\nvolume, so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at\nhand, even though she did not look at them. Not to be happy, when she\nwas supposed to be happier than she would ever be again that, as far as\nshe could see, was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as\nsoon as she arrived, two days before, and seemed now so intolerable\nthat she had left the family party, and come out here to consider it by\nherself. It was not she who thought herself unhappy, but her cousins,\nwho thought it for her. The house was full of cousins, much of her age,\nor even younger, and among them they had some terribly bright eyes.\nThey seemed always on the search for something between her and Rodney,\nwhich they expected to find, and yet did not find; and when they\nsearched, Katharine became aware of wanting what she had not been\nconscious of wanting in London, alone with William and her parents. Or,\nif she did not want it, she missed it. And this state of mind depressed\nher, because she had been accustomed always to give complete\nsatisfaction, and her self-love was now a little ruffled. She would\nhave liked to break through the reserve habitual to her in order to\njustify her engagement to some one whose opinion she valued. No one had\nspoken a word of criticism, but they left her alone with William; not\nthat that would have mattered, if they had not left her alone so\npolitely; and, perhaps, that would not have mattered if they had not\nseemed so queerly silent, almost respectful, in her presence, which\ngave way to criticism, she felt, out of it.\n\nLooking now and then at the sky, she went through the list of her\ncousins  names: Eleanor, Humphrey, Marmaduke, Silvia, Henry, Cassandra,\nGilbert, and Mostyn Henry, the cousin who taught the young ladies of\nBungay to play upon the violin, was the only one in whom she could\nconfide, and as she walked up and down beneath the hoops of the\npergola, she did begin a little speech to him, which ran something like\nthis:\n\n\"To begin with, I m very fond of William. You can t deny that. I know\nhim better than any one, almost. But why I m marrying him is, partly, I\nadmit I m being quite honest with you, and you mustn t tell any\none partly because I want to get married. I want to have a house of my\nown. It isn t possible at home. It s all very well for you, Henry; you\ncan go your own way. I have to be there always. Besides, you know what\nour house is. You wouldn t be happy either, if you didn t do something.\nIt isn t that I haven t the time at home it s the atmosphere.\" Here,\npresumably, she imagined that her cousin, who had listened with his\nusual intelligent sympathy, raised his eyebrows a little, and\ninterposed:\n\n\"Well, but what do you want to do?\"\n\nEven in this purely imaginary dialogue, Katharine found it difficult to\nconfide her ambition to an imaginary companion.\n\n\"I should like,\" she began, and hesitated quite a long time before she\nforced herself to add, with a change of voice, \"to study mathematics to\nknow about the stars.\"\n\nHenry was clearly amazed, but too kind to express all his doubts; he\nonly said something about the difficulties of mathematics, and remarked\nthat very little was known about the stars.\n\nKatharine thereupon went on with the statement of her case.\n\n\"I don t care much whether I ever get to know anything but I want to\nwork out something in figures something that hasn t got to do with\nhuman beings. I don t want people particularly. In some ways, Henry,\nI m a humbug I mean, I m not what you all take me for. I m not\ndomestic, or very practical or sensible, really. And if I could\ncalculate things, and use a telescope, and have to work out figures,\nand know to a fraction where I was wrong, I should be perfectly happy,\nand I believe I should give William all he wants.\"\n\nHaving reached this point, instinct told her that she had passed beyond\nthe region in which Henry s advice could be of any good; and, having\nrid her mind of its superficial annoyance, she sat herself upon the\nstone seat, raised her eyes unconsciously and thought about the deeper\nquestions which she had to decide, she knew, for herself. Would she,\nindeed, give William all he wanted? In order to decide the question,\nshe ran her mind rapidly over her little collection of significant\nsayings, looks, compliments, gestures, which had marked their\nintercourse during the last day or two. He had been annoyed because a\nbox, containing some clothes specially chosen by him for her to wear,\nhad been taken to the wrong station, owing to her neglect in the matter\nof labels. The box had arrived in the nick of time, and he had\nremarked, as she came downstairs on the first night, that he had never\nseen her look more beautiful. She outshone all her cousins. He had\ndiscovered that she never made an ugly movement; he also said that the\nshape of her head made it possible for her, unlike most women, to wear\nher hair low. He had twice reproved her for being silent at dinner; and\nonce for never attending to what he said. He had been surprised at the\nexcellence of her French accent, but he thought it was selfish of her\nnot to go with her mother to call upon the Middletons, because they\nwere old family friends and very nice people. On the whole, the balance\nwas nearly even; and, writing down a kind of conclusion in her mind\nwhich finished the sum for the present, at least, she changed the focus\nof her eyes, and saw nothing but the stars.\n\nTo-night they seemed fixed with unusual firmness in the blue, and\nflashed back such a ripple of light into her eyes that she found\nherself thinking that to-night the stars were happy. Without knowing or\ncaring more for Church practices than most people of her age, Katharine\ncould not look into the sky at Christmas time without feeling that, at\nthis one season, the Heavens bend over the earth with sympathy, and\nsignal with immortal radiance that they, too, take part in her\nfestival. Somehow, it seemed to her that they were even now beholding\nthe procession of kings and wise men upon some road on a distant part\nof the earth. And yet, after gazing for another second, the stars did\ntheir usual work upon the mind, froze to cinders the whole of our short\nhuman history, and reduced the human body to an ape-like, furry form,\ncrouching amid the brushwood of a barbarous clod of mud. This stage was\nsoon succeeded by another, in which there was nothing in the universe\nsave stars and the light of stars; as she looked up the pupils of her\neyes so dilated with starlight that the whole of her seemed dissolved\nin silver and spilt over the ledges of the stars for ever and ever\nindefinitely through space. Somehow simultaneously, though\nincongruously, she was riding with the magnanimous hero upon the shore\nor under forest trees, and so might have continued were it not for the\nrebuke forcibly administered by the body, which, content with the\nnormal conditions of life, in no way furthers any attempt on the part\nof the mind to alter them. She grew cold, shook herself, rose, and\nwalked towards the house.\n\nBy the light of the stars, Stogdon House looked pale and romantic, and\nabout twice its natural size. Built by a retired admiral in the early\nyears of the nineteenth century, the curving bow windows of the front,\nnow filled with reddish-yellow light, suggested a portly three-decker,\nsailing seas where those dolphins and narwhals who disport themselves\nupon the edges of old maps were scattered with an impartial hand. A\nsemicircular flight of shallow steps led to a very large door, which\nKatharine had left ajar. She hesitated, cast her eyes over the front of\nthe house, marked that a light burnt in one small window upon an upper\nfloor, and pushed the door open. For a moment she stood in the square\nhall, among many horned skulls, sallow globes, cracked oil-paintings,\nand stuffed owls, hesitating, it seemed, whether she should open the\ndoor on her right, through which the stir of life reached her ears.\nListening for a moment, she heard a sound which decided her,\napparently, not to enter; her uncle, Sir Francis, was playing his\nnightly game of whist; it appeared probable that he was losing.\n\nShe went up the curving stairway, which represented the one attempt at\nceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion, and down a narrow\npassage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the\ngarden. Knocking, she was told to come in. A young man, Henry Otway,\nwas reading, with his feet on the fender. He had a fine head, the brow\narched in the Elizabethan manner, but the gentle, honest eyes were\nrather skeptical than glowing with the Elizabethan vigor. He gave the\nimpression that he had not yet found the cause which suited his\ntemperament.\n\nHe turned, put down his book, and looked at her. He noticed her rather\npale, dew-drenched look, as of one whose mind is not altogether settled\nin the body. He had often laid his difficulties before her, and\nguessed, in some ways hoped, that perhaps she now had need of him. At\nthe same time, she carried on her life with such independence that he\nscarcely expected any confidence to be expressed in words.\n\n\"You have fled, too, then?\" he said, looking at her cloak. Katharine\nhad forgotten to remove this token of her star-gazing.\n\n\"Fled?\" she asked. \"From whom d you mean? Oh, the family party. Yes, it\nwas hot down there, so I went into the garden.\"\n\n\"And aren t you very cold?\" Henry inquired, placing coal on the fire,\ndrawing a chair up to the grate, and laying aside her cloak. Her\nindifference to such details often forced Henry to act the part\ngenerally taken by women in such dealings. It was one of the ties\nbetween them.\n\n\"Thank you, Henry,\" she said. \"I m not disturbing you?\"\n\n\"I m not here. I m at Bungay,\" he replied. \"I m giving a music lesson\nto Harold and Julia. That was why I had to leave the table with the\nladies I m spending the night there, and I shan t be back till late on\nChristmas Eve.\"\n\n\"How I wish \" Katharine began, and stopped short. \"I think these\nparties are a great mistake,\" she added briefly, and sighed.\n\n\"Oh, horrible!\" he agreed; and they both fell silent.\n\nHer sigh made him look at her. Should he venture to ask her why she\nsighed? Was her reticence about her own affairs as inviolable as it had\noften been convenient for rather an egoistical young man to think it?\nBut since her engagement to Rodney, Henry s feeling towards her had\nbecome rather complex; equally divided between an impulse to hurt her\nand an impulse to be tender to her; and all the time he suffered a\ncurious irritation from the sense that she was drifting away from him\nfor ever upon unknown seas. On her side, directly Katharine got into\nhis presence, and the sense of the stars dropped from her, she knew\nthat any intercourse between people is extremely partial; from the\nwhole mass of her feelings, only one or two could be selected for\nHenry s inspection, and therefore she sighed. Then she looked at him,\nand their eyes meeting, much more seemed to be in common between them\nthan had appeared possible. At any rate they had a grandfather in\ncommon; at any rate there was a kind of loyalty between them sometimes\nfound between relations who have no other cause to like each other, as\nthese two had.\n\n\"Well, what s the date of the wedding?\" said Henry, the malicious mood\nnow predominating.\n\n\"I think some time in March,\" she replied.\n\n\"And afterwards?\" he asked.\n\n\"We take a house, I suppose, somewhere in Chelsea.\"\n\n\"It s very interesting,\" he observed, stealing another look at her.\n\nShe lay back in her arm-chair, her feet high upon the side of the\ngrate, and in front of her, presumably to screen her eyes, she held a\nnewspaper from which she picked up a sentence or two now and again.\nObserving this, Henry remarked:\n\n\"Perhaps marriage will make you more human.\"\n\nAt this she lowered the newspaper an inch or two, but said nothing.\nIndeed, she sat quite silent for over a minute.\n\n\"When you consider things like the stars, our affairs don t seem to\nmatter very much, do they?\" she said suddenly.\n\n\"I don t think I ever do consider things like the stars,\" Henry\nreplied. \"I m not sure that that s not the explanation, though,\" he\nadded, now observing her steadily.\n\n\"I doubt whether there is an explanation,\" she replied rather\nhurriedly, not clearly understanding what he meant.\n\n\"What? No explanation of anything?\" he inquired, with a smile.\n\n\"Oh, things happen. That s about all,\" she let drop in her casual,\ndecided way.\n\n\"That certainly seems to explain some of your actions,\" Henry thought\nto himself.\n\n\"One thing s about as good as another, and one s got to do something,\"\nhe said aloud, expressing what he supposed to be her attitude, much in\nher accent. Perhaps she detected the imitation, for looking gently at\nhim, she said, with ironical composure:\n\n\"Well, if you believe that your life must be simple, Henry.\"\n\n\"But I don t believe it,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"No more do I,\" she replied.\n\n\"What about the stars?\" he asked a moment later. \"I understand that you\nrule your life by the stars?\"\n\nShe let this pass, either because she did not attend to it, or because\nthe tone was not to her liking.\n\nOnce more she paused, and then she inquired:\n\n\"But do you always understand why you do everything? Ought one to\nunderstand? People like my mother understand,\" she reflected. \"Now I\nmust go down to them, I suppose, and see what s happening.\"\n\n\"What could be happening?\" Henry protested.\n\n\"Oh, they may want to settle something,\" she replied vaguely, putting\nher feet on the ground, resting her chin on her hands, and looking out\nof her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire.\n\n\"And then there s William,\" she added, as if by an afterthought.\n\nHenry very nearly laughed, but restrained himself.\n\n\"Do they know what coals are made of, Henry?\" she asked, a moment\nlater.\n\n\"Mares  tails, I believe,\" he hazarded.\n\n\"Have you ever been down a coal-mine?\" she went on.\n\n\"Don t let s talk about coal-mines, Katharine,\" he protested. \"We shall\nprobably never see each other again. When you re married \"\n\nTremendously to his surprise, he saw the tears stand in her eyes.\n\n\"Why do you all tease me?\" she said. \"It isn t kind.\"\n\nHenry could not pretend that he was altogether ignorant of her meaning,\nthough, certainly, he had never guessed that she minded the teasing.\nBut before he knew what to say, her eyes were clear again, and the\nsudden crack in the surface was almost filled up.\n\n\"Things aren t easy, anyhow,\" she stated.\n\nObeying an impulse of genuine affection, Henry spoke.\n\n\"Promise me, Katharine, that if I can ever help you, you will let me.\"\n\nShe seemed to consider, looking once more into the red of the fire, and\ndecided to refrain from any explanation.\n\n\"Yes, I promise that,\" she said at length, and Henry felt himself\ngratified by her complete sincerity, and began to tell her now about\nthe coal-mine, in obedience to her love of facts.\n\nThey were, indeed, descending the shaft in a small cage, and could hear\nthe picks of the miners, something like the gnawing of rats, in the\nearth beneath them, when the door was burst open, without any knocking.\n\n\"Well, here you are!\" Rodney exclaimed. Both Katharine and Henry turned\nround very quickly and rather guiltily. Rodney was in evening dress. It\nwas clear that his temper was ruffled.\n\n\"That s where you ve been all the time,\" he repeated, looking at\nKatharine.\n\n\"I ve only been here about ten minutes,\" she replied.\n\n\"My dear Katharine, you left the drawing-room over an hour ago.\"\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n\"Does it very much matter?\" Henry asked.\n\nRodney found it hard to be unreasonable in the presence of another man,\nand did not answer him.\n\n\"They don t like it,\" he said. \"It isn t kind to old people to leave\nthem alone although I ve no doubt it s much more amusing to sit up here\nand talk to Henry.\"\n\n\"We were discussing coal-mines,\" said Henry urbanely.\n\n\"Yes. But we were talking about much more interesting things before\nthat,\" said Katharine.\n\nFrom the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke, Henry\nthought that some sort of explosion on Rodney s part was about to take\nplace.\n\n\"I can quite understand that,\" said Rodney, with his little chuckle,\nleaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly\nwith his fingers. They were all silent, and the silence was acutely\nuncomfortable to Henry, at least.\n\n\"Was it very dull, William?\" Katharine suddenly asked, with a complete\nchange of tone and a little gesture of her hand.\n\n\"Of course it was dull,\" William said sulkily.\n\n\"Well, you stay and talk to Henry, and I ll go down,\" she replied.\n\nShe rose as she spoke, and as she turned to leave the room, she laid\nher hand, with a curiously caressing gesture, upon Rodney s shoulder.\nInstantly Rodney clasped her hand in his, with such an impulse of\nemotion that Henry was annoyed, and rather ostentatiously opened a\nbook.\n\n\"I shall come down with you,\" said William, as she drew back her hand,\nand made as if to pass him.\n\n\"Oh no,\" she said hastily. \"You stay here and talk to Henry.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Henry, shutting up his book again. His invitation was\npolite, without being precisely cordial. Rodney evidently hesitated as\nto the course he should pursue, but seeing Katharine at the door, he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"No. I want to come with you.\"\n\nShe looked back, and said in a very commanding tone, and with an\nexpression of authority upon her face:\n\n\"It s useless for you to come. I shall go to bed in ten minutes. Good\nnight.\"\n\nShe nodded to them both, but Henry could not help noticing that her\nlast nod was in his direction. Rodney sat down rather heavily.\n\nHis mortification was so obvious that Henry scarcely liked to open the\nconversation with some remark of a literary character. On the other\nhand, unless he checked him, Rodney might begin to talk about his\nfeelings, and irreticence is apt to be extremely painful, at any rate\nin prospect. He therefore adopted a middle course; that is to say, he\nwrote a note upon the fly-leaf of his book, which ran, \"The situation\nis becoming most uncomfortable.\" This he decorated with those\nflourishes and decorative borders which grow of themselves upon these\noccasions; and as he did so, he thought to himself that whatever\nKatharine s difficulties might be, they did not justify her behavior.\nShe had spoken with a kind of brutality which suggested that, whether\nit is natural or assumed, women have a peculiar blindness to the\nfeelings of men.\n\nThe penciling of this note gave Rodney time to recover himself.\nPerhaps, for he was a very vain man, he was more hurt that Henry had\nseen him rebuffed than by the rebuff itself. He was in love with\nKatharine, and vanity is not decreased but increased by love;\nespecially, one may hazard, in the presence of one s own sex. But\nRodney enjoyed the courage which springs from that laughable and\nlovable defect, and when he had mastered his first impulse, in some way\nto make a fool of himself, he drew inspiration from the perfect fit of\nhis evening dress. He chose a cigarette, tapped it on the back of his\nhand, displayed his exquisite pumps on the edge of the fender, and\nsummoned his self-respect.\n\n\"You ve several big estates round here, Otway,\" he began. \"Any good\nhunting? Let me see, what pack would it be? Who s your great man?\"\n\n\"Sir William Budge, the sugar king, has the biggest estate. He bought\nout poor Stanham, who went bankrupt.\"\n\n\"Which Stanham would that be? Verney or Alfred?\"\n\n\"Alfred.... I don t hunt myself. You re a great huntsman, aren t you?\nYou have a great reputation as a horseman, anyhow,\" he added, desiring\nto help Rodney in his effort to recover his complacency.\n\n\"Oh, I love riding,\" Rodney replied. \"Could I get a horse down here?\nStupid of me! I forgot to bring any clothes. I can t imagine, though,\nwho told you I was anything of a rider?\"\n\nTo tell the truth, Henry labored under the same difficulty; he did not\nwish to introduce Katharine s name, and, therefore, he replied vaguely\nthat he had always heard that Rodney was a great rider. In truth, he\nhad heard very little about him, one way or another, accepting him as a\nfigure often to be found in the background at his aunt s house, and\ninevitably, though inexplicably, engaged to his cousin.\n\n\"I don t care much for shooting,\" Rodney continued; \"but one has to do\nit, unless one wants to be altogether out of things. I dare say there s\nsome very pretty country round here. I stayed once at Bolham Hall.\nYoung Cranthorpe was up with you, wasn t he? He married old Lord\nBolham s daughter. Very nice people in their way.\"\n\n\"I don t mix in that society,\" Henry remarked, rather shortly. But\nRodney, now started on an agreeable current of reflection, could not\nresist the temptation of pursuing it a little further. He appeared to\nhimself as a man who moved easily in very good society, and knew enough\nabout the true values of life to be himself above it.\n\n\"Oh, but you should,\" he went on. \"It s well worth staying there,\nanyhow, once a year. They make one very comfortable, and the women are\nravishing.\"\n\n\"The women?\" Henry thought to himself, with disgust. \"What could any\nwoman see in you?\" His tolerance was rapidly becoming exhausted, but he\ncould not help liking Rodney nevertheless, and this appeared to him\nstrange, for he was fastidious, and such words in another mouth would\nhave condemned the speaker irreparably. He began, in short, to wonder\nwhat kind of creature this man who was to marry his cousin might be.\nCould any one, except a rather singular character, afford to be so\nridiculously vain?\n\n\"I don t think I should get on in that society,\" he replied. \"I don t\nthink I should know what to say to Lady Rose if I met her.\"\n\n\"I don t find any difficulty,\" Rodney chuckled. \"You talk to them about\ntheir children, if they have any, or their accomplishments painting,\ngardening, poetry they re so delightfully sympathetic. Seriously, you\nknow I think a woman s opinion of one s poetry is always worth having.\nDon t ask them for their reasons. Just ask them for their feelings.\nKatharine, for example \"\n\n\"Katharine,\" said Henry, with an emphasis upon the name, almost as if\nhe resented Rodney s use of it, \"Katharine is very unlike most women.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Rodney agreed. \"She is \" He seemed about to describe her, and\nhe hesitated for a long time. \"She s looking very well,\" he stated, or\nrather almost inquired, in a different tone from that in which he had\nbeen speaking. Henry bent his head.\n\n\"But, as a family, you re given to moods, eh?\"\n\n\"Not Katharine,\" said Henry, with decision.\n\n\"Not Katharine,\" Rodney repeated, as if he weighed the meaning of the\nwords. \"No, perhaps you re right. But her engagement has changed her.\nNaturally,\" he added, \"one would expect that to be so.\" He waited for\nHenry to confirm this statement, but Henry remained silent.\n\n\"Katharine has had a difficult life, in some ways,\" he continued. \"I\nexpect that marriage will be good for her. She has great powers.\"\n\n\"Great,\" said Henry, with decision.\n\n\"Yes but now what direction d you think they take?\"\n\nRodney had completely dropped his pose as a man of the world, and\nseemed to be asking Henry to help him in a difficulty.\n\n\"I don t know,\" Henry hesitated cautiously.\n\n\"D you think children a household that sort of thing d you think\nthat ll satisfy her? Mind, I m out all day.\"\n\n\"She would certainly be very competent,\" Henry stated.\n\n\"Oh, she s wonderfully competent,\" said Rodney. \"But I get absorbed in\nmy poetry. Well, Katharine hasn t got that. She admires my poetry, you\nknow, but that wouldn t be enough for her?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Henry. He paused. \"I think you re right,\" he added, as if he\nwere summing up his thoughts. \"Katharine hasn t found herself yet. Life\nisn t altogether real to her yet I sometimes think \"\n\n\"Yes?\" Rodney inquired, as if he were eager for Henry to continue.\n\"That is what I \" he was going on, as Henry remained silent, but the\nsentence was not finished, for the door opened, and they were\ninterrupted by Henry s younger brother Gilbert, much to Henry s relief,\nfor he had already said more than he liked.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XVII\n\n\nWhen the sun shone, as it did with unusual brightness that Christmas\nweek, it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well-kept-up\nin Stogdon House and its grounds. In truth, Sir Francis had retired\nfrom service under the Government of India with a pension that was not\nadequate, in his opinion, to his services, as it certainly was not\nadequate to his ambitions. His career had not come up to his\nexpectations, and although he was a very fine, white-whiskered,\nmahogany-colored old man to look at, and had laid down a very choice\ncellar of good reading and good stories, you could not long remain\nignorant of the fact that some thunder-storm had soured them; he had a\ngrievance. This grievance dated back to the middle years of the last\ncentury, when, owing to some official intrigue, his merits had been\npassed over in a disgraceful manner in favor of another, his junior.\n\nThe rights and wrongs of the story, presuming that they had some\nexistence in fact, were no longer clearly known to his wife and\nchildren; but this disappointment had played a very large part in their\nlives, and had poisoned the life of Sir Francis much as a\ndisappointment in love is said to poison the whole life of a woman.\nLong brooding on his failure, continual arrangement and rearrangement\nof his deserts and rebuffs, had made Sir Francis much of an egoist, and\nin his retirement his temper became increasingly difficult and\nexacting.\n\nHis wife now offered so little resistance to his moods that she was\npractically useless to him. He made his daughter Eleanor into his chief\nconfidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her\nfather. To her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory,\nand she had to assure him constantly that his treatment had been a\ndisgrace. Already, at the age of thirty-five, her cheeks were whitening\nas her mother s had whitened, but for her there would be no memories of\nIndian suns and Indian rivers, and clamor of children in a nursery; she\nwould have very little of substance to think about when she sat, as\nLady Otway now sat, knitting white wool, with her eyes fixed almost\nperpetually upon the same embroidered bird upon the same fire-screen.\nBut then Lady Otway was one of the people for whom the great\nmake-believe game of English social life has been invented; she spent\nmost of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she\nwas a dignified, important, much-occupied person, of considerable\nsocial standing and sufficient wealth. In view of the actual state of\nthings this game needed a great deal of skill; and, perhaps, at the age\nshe had reached she was over sixty she played far more to deceive\nherself than to deceive any one else. Moreover, the armor was wearing\nthin; she forgot to keep up appearances more and more.\n\nThe worn patches in the carpets, and the pallor of the drawing-room,\nwhere no chair or cover had been renewed for some years, were due not\nonly to the miserable pension, but to the wear and tear of twelve\nchildren, eight of whom were sons. As often happens in these large\nfamilies, a distinct dividing-line could be traced, about half-way in\nthe succession, where the money for educational purposes had run short,\nand the six younger children had grown up far more economically than\nthe elder. If the boys were clever, they won scholarships, and went to\nschool; if they were not clever, they took what the family connection\nhad to offer them. The girls accepted situations occasionally, but\nthere were always one or two at home, nursing sick animals, tending\nsilkworms, or playing the flute in their bedrooms. The distinction\nbetween the elder children and the younger corresponded almost to the\ndistinction between a higher class and a lower one, for with only a\nhaphazard education and insufficient allowances, the younger children\nhad picked up accomplishments, friends, and points of view which were\nnot to be found within the walls of a public school or of a Government\noffice. Between the two divisions there was considerable hostility, the\nelder trying to patronize the younger, the younger refusing to respect\nthe elder; but one feeling united them and instantly closed any risk of\na breach their common belief in the superiority of their own family to\nall others. Henry was the eldest of the younger group, and their\nleader; he bought strange books and joined odd societies; he went\nwithout a tie for a whole year, and had six shirts made of black\nflannel. He had long refused to take a seat either in a shipping office\nor in a tea-merchant s warehouse; and persisted, in spite of the\ndisapproval of uncles and aunts, in practicing both violin and piano,\nwith the result that he could not perform professionally upon either.\nIndeed, for thirty-two years of life he had nothing more substantial to\nshow than a manuscript book containing the score of half an opera. In\nthis protest of his, Katharine had always given him her support, and as\nshe was generally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed\ntoo well to be eccentric, he had found her support of some use. Indeed,\nwhen she came down at Christmas she usually spent a great part of her\ntime in private conferences with Henry and with Cassandra, the youngest\ngirl, to whom the silkworms belonged. With the younger section she had\na great reputation for common sense, and for something that they\ndespised but inwardly respected and called knowledge of the world that\nis to say, of the way in which respectable elderly people, going to\ntheir clubs and dining out with ministers, think and behave. She had\nmore than once played the part of ambassador between Lady Otway and her\nchildren. That poor lady, for instance, consulted her for advice when,\none day, she opened Cassandra s bedroom door on a mission of discovery,\nand found the ceiling hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked\nwith cages, and the tables stacked with home-made machines for the\nmanufacture of silk dresses.\n\n\"I wish you could help her to take an interest in something that other\npeople are interested in, Katharine,\" she observed, rather plaintively,\ndetailing her grievances. \"It s all Henry s doing, you know, giving up\nher parties and taking to these nasty insects. It doesn t follow that\nif a man can do a thing a woman may too.\"\n\nThe morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas in\nLady Otway s private sitting-room appear more than usually shabby, and\nthe gallant gentlemen, her brothers and cousins, who had defended the\nEmpire and left their bones on many frontiers, looked at the world\nthrough a film of yellow which the morning light seemed to have drawn\nacross their photographs. Lady Otway sighed, it may be at the faded\nrelics, and turned, with resignation, to her balls of wool, which,\ncuriously and characteristically, were not an ivory-white, but rather a\ntarnished yellow-white. She had called her niece in for a little chat.\nShe had always trusted her, and now more than ever, since her\nengagement to Rodney, which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable,\nand just what one would wish for one s own daughter. Katharine\nunwittingly increased her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given\nknitting-needles too.\n\n\"It s so very pleasant,\" said Lady Otway, \"to knit while one s talking.\nAnd now, my dear Katharine, tell me about your plans.\"\n\nThe emotions of the night before, which she had suppressed in such a\nway as to keep her awake till dawn, had left Katharine a little jaded,\nand thus more matter-of-fact than usual. She was quite ready to discuss\nher plans houses and rents, servants and economy without feeling that\nthey concerned her very much. As she spoke, knitting methodically\nmeanwhile, Lady Otway noted, with approval, the upright, responsible\nbearing of her niece, to whom the prospect of marriage had brought some\ngravity most becoming in a bride, and yet, in these days, most rare.\nYes, Katharine s engagement had changed her a little.\n\n\"What a perfect daughter, or daughter-in-law!\" she thought to herself,\nand could not help contrasting her with Cassandra, surrounded by\ninnumerable silkworms in her bedroom.\n\n\"Yes,\" she continued, glancing at Katharine, with the round, greenish\neyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles, \"Katharine is like\nthe girls of my youth. We took the serious things of life seriously.\"\nBut just as she was deriving satisfaction from this thought, and was\nproducing some of the hoarded wisdom which none of her own daughters,\nalas! seemed now to need, the door opened, and Mrs. Hilbery came in, or\nrather, did not come in, but stood in the doorway and smiled, having\nevidently mistaken the room.\n\n\"I never _shall_ know my way about this house!\" she exclaimed. \"I m on\nmy way to the library, and I don t want to interrupt. You and Katharine\nwere having a little chat?\"\n\nThe presence of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy. How\ncould she go on with what she was saying in Maggie s presence? for she\nwas saying something that she had never said, all these years, to\nMaggie herself.\n\n\"I was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage,\" she\nsaid, with a little laugh. \"Are none of my children looking after you,\nMaggie?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" said Mrs. Hilbery, coming into the room, and nodding her\nhead once or twice, \"I always say marriage is a school. And you don t\nget the prizes unless you go to school. Charlotte has won all the\nprizes,\" she added, giving her sister-in-law a little pat, which made\nLady Otway more uncomfortable still. She half laughed, muttered\nsomething, and ended on a sigh.\n\n\"Aunt Charlotte was saying that it s no good being married unless you\nsubmit to your husband,\" said Katharine, framing her aunt s words into\na far more definite shape than they had really worn; and when she spoke\nthus she did not appear at all old-fashioned. Lady Otway looked at her\nand paused for a moment.\n\n\"Well, I really don t advise a woman who wants to have things her own\nway to get married,\" she said, beginning a fresh row rather\nelaborately.\n\nMrs. Hilbery knew something of the circumstances which, as she thought,\nhad inspired this remark. In a moment her face was clouded with\nsympathy which she did not quite know how to express.\n\n\"What a shame it was!\" she exclaimed, forgetting that her train of\nthought might not be obvious to her listeners. \"But, Charlotte, it\nwould have been much worse if Frank had disgraced himself in any way.\nAnd it isn t what our husbands GET, but what they _are_. I used to\ndream of white horses and palanquins, too; but still, I like the\nink-pots best. And who knows?\" she concluded, looking at Katharine,\n\"your father may be made a baronet to-morrow.\"\n\nLady Otway, who was Mr. Hilbery s sister, knew quite well that, in\nprivate, the Hilberys called Sir Francis \"that old Turk,\" and though\nshe did not follow the drift of Mrs. Hilbery s remarks, she knew what\nprompted them.\n\n\"But if you can give way to your husband,\" she said, speaking to\nKatharine, as if there were a separate understanding between them, \"a\nhappy marriage is the happiest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine, \"but \" She did not mean to finish her sentence,\nshe merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt to go on talking\nabout marriage, for she was in the mood to feel that other people could\nhelp her if they would. She went on knitting, but her fingers worked\nwith a decision that was oddly unlike the smooth and contemplative\nsweep of Lady Otway s plump hand. Now and then she looked swiftly at\nher mother, then at her aunt. Mrs. Hilbery held a book in her hand, and\nwas on her way, as Katharine guessed, to the library, where another\nparagraph was to be added to that varied assortment of paragraphs, the\nLife of Richard Alardyce. Normally, Katharine would have hurried her\nmother downstairs, and seen that no excuse for distraction came her\nway. Her attitude towards the poet s life, however, had changed with\nother changes; and she was content to forget all about her scheme of\nhours. Mrs. Hilbery was secretly delighted. Her relief at finding\nherself excused manifested itself in a series of sidelong glances of\nsly humor in her daughter s direction, and the indulgence put her in\nthe best of spirits. Was she to be allowed merely to sit and talk? It\nwas so much pleasanter to sit in a nice room filled with all sorts of\ninteresting odds and ends which she hadn t looked at for a year, at\nleast, than to seek out one date which contradicted another in a\ndictionary.\n\n\"We ve all had perfect husbands,\" she concluded, generously forgiving\nSir Francis all his faults in a lump. \"Not that I think a bad temper is\nreally a fault in a man. I don t mean a bad temper,\" she corrected\nherself, with a glance obviously in the direction of Sir Francis. \"I\nshould say a quick, impatient temper. Most, in fact _all_ great men\nhave had bad tempers except your grandfather, Katharine,\" and here she\nsighed, and suggested that, perhaps, she ought to go down to the\nlibrary.\n\n\"But in the ordinary marriage, is it necessary to give way to one s\nhusband?\" said Katharine, taking no notice of her mother s suggestion,\nblind even to the depression which had now taken possession of her at\nthe thought of her own inevitable death.\n\n\"I should say yes, certainly,\" said Lady Otway, with a decision most\nunusual for her.\n\n\"Then one ought to make up one s mind to that before one is married,\"\nKatharine mused, seeming to address herself.\n\nMrs. Hilbery was not much interested in these remarks, which seemed to\nhave a melancholy tendency, and to revive her spirits she had recourse\nto an infallible remedy she looked out of the window.\n\n\"Do look at that lovely little blue bird!\" she exclaimed, and her eye\nlooked with extreme pleasure at the soft sky. at the trees, at the\ngreen fields visible behind those trees, and at the leafless branches\nwhich surrounded the body of the small blue tit. Her sympathy with\nnature was exquisite.\n\n\"Most women know by instinct whether they can give it or not,\" Lady\nOtway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, as if she wanted to\nget this said while her sister-in-law s attention was diverted. \"And if\nnot well then, my advice would be don t marry.\"\n\n\"Oh, but marriage is the happiest life for a woman,\" said Mrs. Hilbery,\ncatching the word marriage, as she brought her eyes back to the room\nagain. Then she turned her mind to what she had said.\n\n\"It s the most _interesting_ life,\" she corrected herself. She looked\nat her daughter with a look of vague alarm. It was the kind of maternal\nscrutiny which suggests that, in looking at her daughter a mother is\nreally looking at herself. She was not altogether satisfied; but she\npurposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which, as a matter\nof fact, was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in\nher daughter. But when her mother said that marriage was the most\ninteresting life, Katharine felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no\ndefinite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing\nin every possible way. Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to\nfeelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than\nto our feelings as individuals, and Katharine knew that only some one\nof her own age could follow her meaning. Both these elderly women\nseemed to her to have been content with so little happiness, and at the\nmoment she had not sufficient force to feel certain that their version\nof marriage was the wrong one. In London, certainly, this temperate\nattitude toward her own marriage had seemed to her just. Why had she\nnow changed? Why did it now depress her? It never occurred to her that\nher own conduct could be anything of a puzzle to her mother, or that\nelder people are as much affected by the young as the young are by\nthem. And yet it was true that love passion whatever one chose to call\nit, had played far less part in Mrs. Hilbery s life than might have\nseemed likely, judging from her enthusiastic and imaginative\ntemperament. She had always been more interested by other things. Lady\nOtway, strange though it seemed, guessed more accurately at Katharine s\nstate of mind than her mother did.\n\n\"Why don t we all live in the country?\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, once\nmore looking out of the window. \"I m sure one would think such\nbeautiful things if one lived in the country. No horrid slum houses to\ndepress one, no trams or motor-cars; and the people all looking so\nplump and cheerful. Isn t there some little cottage near you,\nCharlotte, which would do for us, with a spare room, perhaps, in case\nwe asked a friend down? And we should save so much money that we should\nbe able to travel \"\n\n\"Yes. You would find it very nice for a week or two, no doubt,\" said\nLady Otway. \"But what hour would you like the carriage this morning?\"\nshe continued, touching the bell.\n\n\"Katharine shall decide,\" said Mrs. Hilbery, feeling herself unable to\nprefer one hour to another. \"And I was just going to tell you,\nKatharine, how, when I woke this morning, everything seemed so clear in\nmy head that if I d had a pencil I believe I could have written quite a\nlong chapter. When we re out on our drive I shall find us a house. A\nfew trees round it, and a little garden, a pond with a Chinese duck, a\nstudy for your father, a study for me, and a sitting room for\nKatharine, because then she ll be a married lady.\"\n\nAt this Katharine shivered a little, drew up to the fire, and warmed\nher hands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the coal. She\nwished to bring the talk back to marriage again, in order to hear Aunt\nCharlotte s views, but she did not know how to do this.\n\n\"Let me look at your engagement-ring, Aunt Charlotte,\" she said,\nnoticing her own.\n\nShe took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and round, but\nshe did not know what to say next.\n\n\"That poor old ring was a sad disappointment to me when I first had\nit,\" Lady Otway mused. \"I d set my heart on a diamond ring, but I never\nliked to tell Frank, naturally. He bought it at Simla.\"\n\nKatharine turned the ring round once more, and gave it back to her aunt\nwithout speaking. And while she turned it round her lips set themselves\nfirmly together, and it seemed to her that she could satisfy William as\nthese women had satisfied their husbands; she could pretend to like\nemeralds when she preferred diamonds. Having replaced her ring, Lady\nOtway remarked that it was chilly, though not more so than one must\nexpect at this time of year. Indeed, one ought to be thankful to see\nthe sun at all, and she advised them both to dress warmly for their\ndrive. Her aunt s stock of commonplaces, Katharine sometimes suspected,\nhad been laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do\nwith her private thoughts. But at this moment they seemed terribly in\nkeeping with her own conclusions, so that she took up her knitting\nagain and listened, chiefly with a view to confirming herself in the\nbelief that to be engaged to marry some one with whom you are not in\nlove is an inevitable step in a world where the existence of passion is\nonly a traveller s story brought from the heart of deep forests and\ntold so rarely that wise people doubt whether the story can be true.\nShe did her best to listen to her mother asking for news of John, and\nto her aunt replying with the authentic history of Hilda s engagement\nto an officer in the Indian Army, but she cast her mind alternately\ntowards forest paths and starry blossoms, and towards pages of neatly\nwritten mathematical signs. When her mind took this turn her marriage\nseemed no more than an archway through which it was necessary to pass\nin order to have her desire. At such times the current of her nature\nran in its deep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming\nlack of consideration for the feelings of others. Just as the two elder\nladies had finished their survey of the family prospects, and Lady\nOtway was nervously anticipating some general statement as to life and\ndeath from her sister-in-law, Cassandra burst into the room with the\nnews that the carriage was at the door.\n\n\"Why didn t Andrews tell me himself?\" said Lady Otway, peevishly,\nblaming her servants for not living up to her ideals.\n\nWhen Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine arrived in the hall, ready dressed for\ntheir drive, they found that the usual discussion was going forward as\nto the plans of the rest of the family. In token of this, a great many\ndoors were opening and shutting, two or three people stood irresolutely\non the stairs, now going a few steps up, and now a few steps down, and\nSir Francis himself had come out from his study, with the \"Times\" under\nhis arm, and a complaint about noise and draughts from the open door\nwhich, at least, had the effect of bundling the people who did not want\nto go into the carriage, and sending those who did not want to stay\nback to their rooms. It was decided that Mrs. Hilbery, Katharine,\nRodney, and Henry should drive to Lincoln, and any one else who wished\nto go should follow on bicycles or in the pony-cart. Every one who\nstayed at Stogdon House had to make this expedition to Lincoln in\nobedience to Lady Otway s conception of the right way to entertain her\nguests, which she had imbibed from reading in fashionable papers of the\nbehavior of Christmas parties in ducal houses. The carriage horses were\nboth fat and aged, still they matched; the carriage was shaky and\nuncomfortable, but the Otway arms were visible on the panels. Lady\nOtway stood on the topmost step, wrapped in a white shawl, and waved\nher hand almost mechanically until they had turned the corner under the\nlaurel-bushes, when she retired indoors with a sense that she had\nplayed her part, and a sigh at the thought that none of her children\nfelt it necessary to play theirs.\n\nThe carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road. Mrs.\nHilbery dropped into a pleasant, inattentive state of mind, in which\nshe was conscious of the running green lines of the hedges, of the\nswelling ploughland, and of the mild blue sky, which served her, after\nthe first five minutes, for a pastoral background to the drama of human\nlife; and then she thought of a cottage garden, with the flash of\nyellow daffodils against blue water; and what with the arrangement of\nthese different prospects, and the shaping of two or three lovely\nphrases, she did not notice that the young people in the carriage were\nalmost silent. Henry, indeed, had been included against his wish, and\nrevenged himself by observing Katharine and Rodney with disillusioned\neyes; while Katharine was in a state of gloomy self-suppression which\nresulted in complete apathy. When Rodney spoke to her she either said\n\"Hum!\" or assented so listlessly that he addressed his next remark to\nher mother. His deference was agreeable to her, his manners were\nexemplary; and when the church towers and factory chimneys of the town\ncame into sight, she roused herself, and recalled memories of the fair\nsummer of 1853, which fitted in harmoniously with what she was dreaming\nof the future.\n\n\n\n\n",

A county town draws the inhabitants of all vicarages, farms,\ncountry houses, and wayside cottages, within a radius of ten miles at\nleast, once or twice a week to its streets; and among them, on this\noccasion, were Ralph Denham and Mary Datchet. They despised the roads,\nand took their way across the fields; and yet, from their appearance,\nit did not seem as if they cared much where they walked so long as the\nway did not actually trip them up. When they left the Vicarage, they\nhad begun an argument which swung their feet along so rhythmically in\ntime with it that they covered the ground at over four miles an hour,\nand saw nothing of the hedgerows, the swelling plowland, or the mild\nblue sky. What they saw were the Houses of Parliament and the\nGovernment Offices in Whitehall. They both belonged to the class which\nis conscious of having lost its birthright in these great structures\nand is seeking to build another kind of lodging for its own notion of\nlaw and government. Purposely, perhaps, Mary did not agree with Ralph;\nshe loved to feel her mind in conflict with his, and to be certain that\nhe spared her female judgment no ounce of his male muscularity. He\nseemed to argue as fiercely with her as if she were his brother. They\nwere alike, however, in believing that it behooved them to take in hand\nthe repair and reconstruction of the fabric of England. They agreed in\nthinking that nature has not been generous in the endowment of our\ncouncilors. They agreed, unconsciously, in a mute love for the muddy\nfield through which they tramped, with eyes narrowed close by the\nconcentration of their minds. At length they drew breath, let the\nargument fly away into the limbo of other good arguments, and, leaning\nover a gate, opened their eyes for the first time and looked about\nthem. Their feet tingled with warm blood and their breath rose in steam\naround them. The bodily exercise made them both feel more direct and\nless self-conscious than usual, and Mary, indeed, was overcome by a\nsort of light-headedness which made it seem to her that it mattered\nvery little what happened next. It mattered so little, indeed, that she\nfelt herself on the point of saying to Ralph:\n\n\"I love you; I shall never love anybody else. Marry me or leave me;\nthink what you like of me I don t care a straw.\" At the moment,\nhowever, speech or silence seemed immaterial, and she merely clapped\nher hands together, and looked at the distant woods with the rust-like\nbloom on their brown, and the green and blue landscape through the\nsteam of her own breath. It seemed a mere toss-up whether she said, \"I\nlove you,\" or whether she said, \"I love the beech-trees,\" or only \"I\nlove I love.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Mary,\" Ralph suddenly interrupted her, \"I ve made up my\nmind.\"\n\nHer indifference must have been superficial, for it disappeared at\nonce. Indeed, she lost sight of the trees, and saw her own hand upon\nthe topmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness, while he went\non:\n\n\"I ve made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here. I want you\nto tell me about that cottage you spoke of. However, I suppose there ll\nbe no difficulty about getting a cottage, will there?\" He spoke with an\nassumption of carelessness as if expecting her to dissuade him.\n\nShe still waited, as if for him to continue; she was convinced that in\nsome roundabout way he approached the subject of their marriage.\n\n\"I can t stand the office any longer,\" he proceeded. \"I don t know what\nmy family will say; but I m sure I m right. Don t you think so?\"\n\n\"Live down here by yourself?\" she asked.\n\n\"Some old woman would do for me, I suppose,\" he replied. \"I m sick of\nthe whole thing,\" he went on, and opened the gate with a jerk. They\nbegan to cross the next field walking side by side.\n\n\"I tell you, Mary, it s utter destruction, working away, day after day,\nat stuff that doesn t matter a damn to any one. I ve stood eight years\nof it, and I m not going to stand it any longer. I suppose this all\nseems to you mad, though?\"\n\nBy this time Mary had recovered her self-control.\n\n\"No. I thought you weren t happy,\" she said.\n\n\"Why did you think that?\" he asked, with some surprise.\n\n\"Don t you remember that morning in Lincoln s Inn Fields?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ralph, slackening his pace and remembering Katharine and\nher engagement, the purple leaves stamped into the path, the white\npaper radiant under the electric light, and the hopelessness which\nseemed to surround all these things.\n\n\"You re right, Mary,\" he said, with something of an effort, \"though I\ndon t know how you guessed it.\"\n\nShe was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his\nunhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.\n\n\"I was unhappy very unhappy,\" he repeated. Some six weeks separated him\nfrom that afternoon when he had sat upon the Embankment watching his\nvisions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense of his\ndesolation still made him shiver. He had not recovered in the least\nfrom that depression. Here was an opportunity for making himself face\nit, as he felt that he ought to; for, by this time, no doubt, it was\nonly a sentimental ghost, better exorcised by ruthless exposure to such\nan eye as Mary s, than allowed to underlie all his actions and thoughts\nas had been the case ever since he first saw Katharine Hilbery pouring\nout tea. He must begin, however, by mentioning her name, and this he\nfound it impossible to do. He persuaded himself that he could make an\nhonest statement without speaking her name; he persuaded himself that\nhis feeling had very little to do with her.\n\n\"Unhappiness is a state of mind,\" he said, \"by which I mean that it is\nnot necessarily the result of any particular cause.\"\n\nThis rather stilted beginning did not please him, and it became more\nand more obvious to him that, whatever he might say, his unhappiness\nhad been directly caused by Katharine.\n\n\"I began to find my life unsatisfactory,\" he started afresh. \"It seemed\nto me meaningless.\" He paused again, but felt that this, at any rate,\nwas true, and that on these lines he could go on.\n\n\"All this money-making and working ten hours a day in an office, what s\nit FOR? When one s a boy, you see, one s head is so full of dreams that\nit doesn t seem to matter what one does. And if you re ambitious,\nyou re all right; you ve got a reason for going on. Now my reasons\nceased to satisfy me. Perhaps I never had any. That s very likely now I\ncome to think of it. (What reason is there for anything, though?)\nStill, it s impossible, after a certain age, to take oneself in\nsatisfactorily. And I know what carried me on\" for a good reason now\noccurred to him \"I wanted to be the savior of my family and all that\nkind of thing. I wanted them to get on in the world. That was a lie, of\ncourse a kind of self-glorification, too. Like most people, I suppose,\nI ve lived almost entirely among delusions, and now I m at the awkward\nstage of finding it out. I want another delusion to go on with. That s\nwhat my unhappiness amounts to, Mary.\"\n\nThere were two reasons that kept Mary very silent during this speech,\nand drew curiously straight lines upon her face. In the first place,\nRalph made no mention of marriage; in the second, he was not speaking\nthe truth.\n\n\"I don t think it will be difficult to find a cottage,\" she said, with\ncheerful hardness, ignoring the whole of this statement. \"You ve got a\nlittle money, haven t you? Yes,\" she concluded, \"I don t see why it\nshouldn t be a very good plan.\"\n\nThey crossed the field in complete silence. Ralph was surprised by her\nremark and a little hurt, and yet, on the whole, rather pleased. He had\nconvinced himself that it was impossible to lay his case truthfully\nbefore Mary, and, secretly, he was relieved to find that he had not\nparted with his dream to her. She was, as he had always found her, the\nsensible, loyal friend, the woman he trusted; whose sympathy he could\ncount upon, provided he kept within certain limits. He was not\ndispleased to find that those limits were very clearly marked. When\nthey had crossed the next hedge she said to him:\n\n\"Yes, Ralph, it s time you made a break. I ve come to the same\nconclusion myself. Only it won t be a country cottage in my case; it ll\nbe America. America!\" she cried. \"That s the place for me! They ll\nteach me something about organizing a movement there, and I ll come\nback and show you how to do it.\"\n\nIf she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion and\nsecurity of a country cottage, she did not succeed; for Ralph s\ndetermination was genuine. But she made him visualize her in her own\ncharacter, so that he looked quickly at her, as she walked a little in\nfront of him across the plowed field; for the first time that morning\nhe saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with Katharine.\nHe seemed to see her marching ahead, a rather clumsy but powerful and\nindependent figure, for whose courage he felt the greatest respect.\n\n\"Don t go away, Mary!\" he exclaimed, and stopped.\n\n\"That s what you said before, Ralph,\" she returned, without looking at\nhim. \"You want to go away yourself and you don t want me to go away.\nThat s not very sensible, is it?\"\n\n\"Mary,\" he cried, stung by the remembrance of his exacting and\ndictatorial ways with her, \"what a brute I ve been to you!\"\n\nIt took all her strength to keep the tears from springing, and to\nthrust back her assurance that she would forgive him till Doomsday if\nhe chose. She was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn kind of\nrespect for herself which lay at the root of her nature and forbade\nsurrender, even in moments of almost overwhelming passion. Now, when\nall was tempest and high-running waves, she knew of a land where the\nsun shone clear upon Italian grammars and files of docketed papers.\nNevertheless, from the skeleton pallor of that land and the rocks that\nbroke its surface, she knew that her life there would be harsh and\nlonely almost beyond endurance. She walked steadily a little in front\nof him across the plowed field. Their way took them round the verge of\na wood of thin trees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land.\nLooking between the tree-trunks, Ralph saw laid out on the perfectly\nflat and richly green meadow at the bottom of the hill a small gray\nmanor-house, with ponds, terraces, and clipped hedges in front of it, a\nfarm building or so at the side, and a screen of fir-trees rising\nbehind, all perfectly sheltered and self-sufficient. Behind the house\nthe hill rose again, and the trees on the farther summit stood upright\nagainst the sky, which appeared of a more intense blue between their\ntrunks. His mind at once was filled with a sense of the actual presence\nof Katharine; the gray house and the intense blue sky gave him the\nfeeling of her presence close by. He leant against a tree, forming her\nname beneath his breath:\n\n\"Katharine, Katharine,\" he said aloud, and then, looking round, saw\nMary walking slowly away from him, tearing a long spray of ivy from the\ntrees as she passed them. She seemed so definitely opposed to the\nvision he held in his mind that he returned to it with a gesture of\nimpatience.\n\n\"Katharine, Katharine,\" he repeated, and seemed to himself to be with\nher. He lost his sense of all that surrounded him; all substantial\nthings the hour of the day, what we have done and are about to do, the\npresence of other people and the support we derive from seeing their\nbelief in a common reality all this slipped from him. So he might have\nfelt if the earth had dropped from his feet, and the empty blue had\nhung all round him, and the air had been steeped in the presence of one\nwoman. The chirp of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him,\nand his awakenment was accompanied by a sigh. Here was the world in\nwhich he had lived; here the plowed field, the high road yonder, and\nMary, stripping ivy from the trees. When he came up with her he linked\nhis arm through hers and said:\n\n\"Now, Mary, what s all this about America?\"\n\nThere was a brotherly kindness in his voice which seemed to her\nmagnanimous, when she reflected that she had cut short his explanations\nand shown little interest in his change of plan. She gave him her\nreasons for thinking that she might profit by such a journey, omitting\nthe one reason which had set all the rest in motion. He listened\nattentively, and made no attempt to dissuade her. In truth, he found\nhimself curiously eager to make certain of her good sense, and accepted\neach fresh proof of it with satisfaction, as though it helped him to\nmake up his mind about something. She forgot the pain he had caused\nher, and in place of it she became conscious of a steady tide of\nwell-being which harmonized very aptly with the tramp of their feet\nupon the dry road and the support of his arm. The comfort was the more\nglowing in that it seemed to be the reward of her determination to\nbehave to him simply and without attempting to be other than she was.\nInstead of making out an interest in the poets, she avoided them\ninstinctively, and dwelt rather insistently upon the practical nature\nof her gifts.\n\nIn a practical way she asked for particulars of his cottage, which\nhardly existed in his mind, and corrected his vagueness.\n\n\"You must see that there s water,\" she insisted, with an exaggeration\nof interest. She avoided asking him what he meant to do in this\ncottage, and, at last, when all the practical details had been thrashed\nout as much as possible, he rewarded her by a more intimate statement.\n\n\"One of the rooms,\" he said, \"must be my study, for, you see, Mary, I m\ngoing to write a book.\" Here he withdrew his arm from hers, lit his\npipe, and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of comradeship, the most\ncomplete they had attained in all their friendship.\n\n\"And what s your book to be about?\" she said, as boldly as if she had\nnever come to grief with Ralph in talking about books. He told her\nunhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the English\nvillage from Saxon days to the present time. Some such plan had lain as\na seed in his mind for many years; and now that he had decided, in a\nflash, to give up his profession, the seed grew in the space of twenty\nminutes both tall and lusty. He was surprised himself at the positive\nway in which he spoke. It was the same with the question of his\ncottage. That had come into existence, too, in an unromantic shape a\nsquare white house standing just off the high road, no doubt, with a\nneighbor who kept a pig and a dozen squalling children; for these plans\nwere shorn of all romance in his mind, and the pleasure he derived from\nthinking of them was checked directly it passed a very sober limit. So\na sensible man who has lost his chance of some beautiful inheritance\nmight tread out the narrow bounds of his actual dwelling-place, and\nassure himself that life is supportable within its demesne, only one\nmust grow turnips and cabbages, not melons and pomegranates. Certainly\nRalph took some pride in the resources of his mind, and was insensibly\nhelped to right himself by Mary s trust in him. She wound her ivy spray\nround her ash-plant, and for the first time for many days, when alone\nwith Ralph, set no spies upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but\nsurrendered herself to complete happiness.\n\nThus talking, with easy silences and some pauses to look at the view\nover the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little gray-brown\nbird slipping among the twigs, they walked into Lincoln, and after\nstrolling up and down the main street, decided upon an inn where the\nrounded window suggested substantial fare, nor were they mistaken. For\nover a hundred and fifty years hot joints, potatoes, greens, and apple\npuddings had been served to generations of country gentlemen, and now,\nsitting at a table in the hollow of the bow window, Ralph and Mary took\ntheir share of this perennial feast. Looking across the joint, half-way\nthrough the meal, Mary wondered whether Ralph would ever come to look\nquite like the other people in the room. Would he be absorbed among the\nround pink faces, pricked with little white bristles, the calves fitted\nin shiny brown leather, the black-and-white check suits, which were\nsprinkled about in the same room with them? She half hoped so; she\nthought that it was only in his mind that he was different. She did not\nwish him to be too different from other people. The walk had given him\na ruddy color, too, and his eyes were lit up by a steady, honest light,\nwhich could not make the simplest farmer feel ill at ease, or suggest\nto the most devout of clergymen a disposition to sneer at his faith.\nShe loved the steep cliff of his forehead, and compared it to the brow\nof a young Greek horseman, who reins his horse back so sharply that it\nhalf falls on its haunches. He always seemed to her like a rider on a\nspirited horse. And there was an exaltation to her in being with him,\nbecause there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right\npace among other people. Sitting opposite him at the little table in\nthe window, she came back to that state of careless exaltation which\nhad overcome her when they halted by the gate, but now it was\naccompanied by a sense of sanity and security, for she felt that they\nhad a feeling in common which scarcely needed embodiment in words. How\nsilent he was! leaning his forehead on his hand, now and then, and\nagain looking steadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the\nnext table, with so little self-consciousness that she could almost\nwatch his mind placing one thought solidly upon the top of another; she\nthought that she could feel him thinking, through the shade of her\nfingers, and she could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an\nend to his thought and turn a little in his chair and say:\n\n\"Well, Mary ?\" inviting her to take up the thread of thought where he\nhad dropped it.\n\nAnd at that very moment he turned just so, and said:\n\n\"Well, Mary?\" with the curious touch of diffidence which she loved in\nhim.\n\nShe laughed, and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment by\nthe look of the people in the street below. There was a motor-car with\nan old lady swathed in blue veils, and a lady s maid on the seat\nopposite, holding a King Charles s spaniel; there was a country-woman\nwheeling a perambulator full of sticks down the middle of the road;\nthere was a bailiff in gaiters discussing the state of the cattle\nmarket with a dissenting minister so she defined them.\n\nShe ran over this list without any fear that her companion would think\nher trivial. Indeed, whether it was due to the warmth of the room or to\nthe good roast beef, or whether Ralph had achieved the process which is\ncalled making up one s mind, certainly he had given up testing the good\nsense, the independent character, the intelligence shown in her\nremarks. He had been building one of those piles of thought, as\nramshackle and fantastic as a Chinese pagoda, half from words let fall\nby gentlemen in gaiters, half from the litter in his own mind, about\nduck shooting and legal history, about the Roman occupation of Lincoln\nand the relations of country gentlemen with their wives, when, from all\nthis disconnected rambling, there suddenly formed itself in his mind\nthe idea that he would ask Mary to marry him. The idea was so\nspontaneous that it seemed to shape itself of its own accord before his\neyes. It was then that he turned round and made use of his old,\ninstinctive phrase:\n\n\"Well, Mary ?\"\n\nAs it presented itself to him at first, the idea was so new and\ninteresting that he was half inclined to address it, without more ado,\nto Mary herself. His natural instinct to divide his thoughts carefully\ninto two different classes before he expressed them to her prevailed.\nBut as he watched her looking out of the window and describing the old\nlady, the woman with the perambulator, the bailiff and the dissenting\nminister, his eyes filled involuntarily with tears. He would have liked\nto lay his head on her shoulder and sob, while she parted his hair with\nher fingers and soothed him and said:\n\n\"There, there. Don t cry! Tell me why you re crying \"; and they would\nclasp each other tight, and her arms would hold him like his mother s.\nHe felt that he was very lonely, and that he was afraid of the other\npeople in the room.\n\n\"How damnable this all is!\" he exclaimed abruptly.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" she replied, rather vaguely, still\nlooking out of the window.\n\nHe resented this divided attention more than, perhaps, he knew, and he\nthought how Mary would soon be on her way to America.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, \"I want to talk to you. Haven t we nearly done? Why\ndon t they take away these plates?\"\n\nMary felt his agitation without looking at him; she felt convinced that\nshe knew what it was that he wished to say to her.\n\n\"They ll come all in good time,\" she said; and felt it necessary to\ndisplay her extreme calmness by lifting a salt-cellar and sweeping up a\nlittle heap of bread-crumbs.\n\n\"I want to apologize,\" Ralph continued, not quite knowing what he was\nabout to say, but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to\ncommit himself irrevocably, and to prevent the moment of intimacy from\npassing.\n\n\"I think I ve treated you very badly. That is, I ve told you lies. Did\nyou guess that I was lying to you? Once in Lincoln s Inn Fields and\nagain to-day on our walk. I am a liar, Mary. Did you know that? Do you\nthink you do know me?\"\n\n\"I think I do,\" she said.\n\nAt this point the waiter changed their plates.\n\n\"It s true I don t want you to go to America,\" he said, looking fixedly\nat the table-cloth. \"In fact, my feelings towards you seem to be\nutterly and damnably bad,\" he said energetically, although forced to\nkeep his voice low.\n\n\"If I weren t a selfish beast I should tell you to have nothing more to\ndo with me. And yet, Mary, in spite of the fact that I believe what I m\nsaying, I also believe that it s good we should know each other the\nworld being what it is, you see \" and by a nod of his head he indicated\nthe other occupants of the room, \"for, of course, in an ideal state of\nthings, in a decent community even, there s no doubt you shouldn t have\nanything to do with me seriously, that is.\"\n\n\"You forget that I m not an ideal character, either,\" said Mary, in the\nsame low and very earnest tones, which, in spite of being almost\ninaudible, surrounded their table with an atmosphere of concentration\nwhich was quite perceptible to the other diners, who glanced at them\nnow and then with a queer mixture of kindness, amusement, and\ncuriosity.\n\n\"I m much more selfish than I let on, and I m worldly a little more\nthan you think, anyhow. I like bossing things perhaps that s my\ngreatest fault. I ve none of your passion for \" here she hesitated, and\nglanced at him, as if to ascertain what his passion was for \"for the\ntruth,\" she added, as if she had found what she sought indisputably.\n\n\"I ve told you I m a liar,\" Ralph repeated obstinately.\n\n\"Oh, in little things, I dare say,\" she said impatiently. \"But not in\nreal ones, and that s what matters. I dare say I m more truthful than\nyou are in small ways. But I could never care\" she was surprised to\nfind herself speaking the word, and had to force herself to speak it\nout \"for any one who was a liar in that way. I love the truth a certain\namount a considerable amount but not in the way you love it.\" Her voice\nsank, became inaudible, and wavered as if she could scarcely keep\nherself from tears.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" Ralph exclaimed to himself. \"She loves me! Why did I\nnever see it before? She s going to cry; no, but she can t speak.\"\n\nThe certainty overwhelmed him so that he scarcely knew what he was\ndoing; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and although he had quite made\nup his mind to ask her to marry him, the certainty that she loved him\nseemed to change the situation so completely that he could not do it.\nHe did not dare to look at her. If she cried, he did not know what he\nshould do. It seemed to him that something of a terrible and\ndevastating nature had happened. The waiter changed their plates once\nmore.\n\nIn his agitation Ralph rose, turned his back upon Mary, and looked out\nof the window. The people in the street seemed to him only a dissolving\nand combining pattern of black particles; which, for the moment,\nrepresented very well the involuntary procession of feelings and\nthoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession in his own\nmind. At one moment he exulted in the thought that Mary loved him; at\nthe next, it seemed that he was without feeling for her; her love was\nrepulsive to him. Now he felt urged to marry her at once; now to\ndisappear and never see her again. In order to control this disorderly\nrace of thought he forced himself to read the name on the chemist s\nshop directly opposite him; then to examine the objects in the shop\nwindows, and then to focus his eyes exactly upon a little group of\nwomen looking in at the great windows of a large draper s shop. This\ndiscipline having given him at least a superficial control of himself,\nhe was about to turn and ask the waiter to bring the bill, when his eye\nwas caught by a tall figure walking quickly along the opposite\npavement a tall figure, upright, dark, and commanding, much detached\nfrom her surroundings. She held her gloves in her left hand, and the\nleft hand was bare. All this Ralph noticed and enumerated and\nrecognized before he put a name to the whole Katharine Hilbery. She\nseemed to be looking for somebody. Her eyes, in fact, scanned both\nsides of the street, and for one second were raised directly to the bow\nwindow in which Ralph stood; but she looked away again instantly\nwithout giving any sign that she had seen him. This sudden apparition\nhad an extraordinary effect upon him. It was as if he had thought of\nher so intensely that his mind had formed the shape of her, rather than\nthat he had seen her in the flesh outside in the street. And yet he had\nnot been thinking of her at all. The impression was so intense that he\ncould not dismiss it, nor even think whether he had seen her or merely\nimagined her. He sat down at once, and said, briefly and strangely,\nrather to himself than to Mary:\n\n\"That was Katharine Hilbery.\"\n\n\"Katharine Hilbery? What do you mean?\" she asked, hardly understanding\nfrom his manner whether he had seen her or not.\n\n\"Katharine Hilbery,\" he repeated. \"But she s gone now.\"\n\n\"Katharine Hilbery!\" Mary thought, in an instant of blinding\nrevelation; \"I ve always known it was Katharine Hilbery!\" She knew it\nall now.\n\nAfter a moment of downcast stupor, she raised her eyes, looked steadily\nat Ralph, and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled at a point far\nbeyond their surroundings, a point that she had never reached in all\nthe time that she had known him. She noticed the lips just parted, the\nfingers loosely clenched, the whole attitude of rapt contemplation,\nwhich fell like a veil between them. She noticed everything about him;\nif there had been other signs of his utter alienation she would have\nsought them out, too, for she felt that it was only by heaping one\ntruth upon another that she could keep herself sitting there, upright.\nThe truth seemed to support her; it struck her, even as she looked at\nhis face, that the light of truth was shining far away beyond him; the\nlight of truth, she seemed to frame the words as she rose to go, shines\non a world not to be shaken by our personal calamities.\n\nRalph handed her her coat and her stick. She took them, fastened the\ncoat securely, grasped the stick firmly. The ivy spray was still\ntwisted about the handle; this one sacrifice, she thought, she might\nmake to sentimentality and personality, and she picked two leaves from\nthe ivy and put them in her pocket before she disencumbered her stick\nof the rest of it. She grasped the stick in the middle, and settled her\nfur cap closely upon her head, as if she must be in trim for a long and\nstormy walk. Next, standing in the middle of the road, she took a slip\nof paper from her purse, and read out loud a list of commissions\nentrusted to her fruit, butter, string, and so on; and all the time she\nnever spoke directly to Ralph or looked at him.\n\nRalph heard her giving orders to attentive, rosy-checked men in white\naprons, and in spite of his own preoccupation, he commented upon the\ndetermination with which she made her wishes known. Once more he began,\nautomatically, to take stock of her characteristics. Standing thus,\nsuperficially observant and stirring the sawdust on the floor\nmeditatively with the toe of his boot, he was roused by a musical and\nfamiliar voice behind him, accompanied by a light touch upon his\nshoulder.\n\n\"I m not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? I caught a glimpse of your coat\nthrough the window, and I felt sure that I knew your coat. Have you\nseen Katharine or William? I m wandering about Lincoln looking for the\nruins.\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Hilbery; her entrance created some stir in the shop; many\npeople looked at her.\n\n\"First of all, tell me where I am,\" she demanded, but, catching sight\nof the attentive shopman, she appealed to him. \"The ruins my party is\nwaiting for me at the ruins. The Roman ruins or Greek, Mr. Denham? Your\ntown has a great many beautiful things in it, but I wish it hadn t so\nmany ruins. I never saw such delightful little pots of honey in my\nlife are they made by your own bees? Please give me one of those little\npots, and tell me how I shall find my way to the ruins.\"\n\n\"And now,\" she continued, having received the information and the pot\nof honey, having been introduced to Mary, and having insisted that they\nshould accompany her back to the ruins, since in a town with so many\nturnings, such prospects, such delightful little half-naked boys\ndabbling in pools, such Venetian canals, such old blue china in the\ncuriosity shops, it was impossible for one person all alone to find her\nway to the ruins. \"Now,\" she exclaimed, \"please tell me what you re\ndoing here, Mr. Denham for you _are_ Mr. Denham, aren t you?\" she\ninquired, gazing at him with a sudden suspicion of her own accuracy.\n\"The brilliant young man who writes for the Review, I mean? Only\nyesterday my husband was telling me he thought you one of the cleverest\nyoung men he knew. Certainly, you ve been the messenger of Providence\nto me, for unless I d seen you I m sure I should never have found the\nruins at all.\"\n\nThey had reached the Roman arch when Mrs. Hilbery caught sight of her\nown party, standing like sentinels facing up and down the road so as to\nintercept her if, as they expected, she had got lodged in some shop.\n\n\"I ve found something much better than ruins!\" she exclaimed. \"I ve\nfound two friends who told me how to find you, which I could never have\ndone without them. They must come and have tea with us. What a pity\nthat we ve just had luncheon.\" Could they not somehow revoke that meal?\n\nKatharine, who had gone a few steps by herself down the road, and was\ninvestigating the window of an ironmonger, as if her mother might have\ngot herself concealed among mowing-machines and garden-shears, turned\nsharply on hearing her voice, and came towards them. She was a great\ndeal surprised to see Denham and Mary Datchet. Whether the cordiality\nwith which she greeted them was merely that which is natural to a\nsurprise meeting in the country, or whether she was really glad to see\nthem both, at any rate she exclaimed with unusual pleasure as she shook\nhands:\n\n\"I never knew you lived here. Why didn t you say so, and we could have\nmet? And are you staying with Mary?\" she continued, turning to Ralph.\n\"What a pity we didn t meet before.\"\n\nThus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real body of\nthe woman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams, Ralph\nstammered; he made a clutch at his self-control; the color either came\nto his cheeks or left them, he knew not which; but he was determined to\nface her and track down in the cold light of day whatever vestige of\ntruth there might be in his persistent imaginations. He did not succeed\nin saying anything. It was Mary who spoke for both of them. He was\nstruck dumb by finding that Katharine was quite different, in some\nstrange way, from his memory, so that he had to dismiss his old view in\norder to accept the new one. The wind was blowing her crimson scarf\nacross her face; the wind had already loosened her hair, which looped\nacross the corner of one of the large, dark eyes which, so he used to\nthink, looked sad; now they looked bright with the brightness of the\nsea struck by an unclouded ray; everything about her seemed rapid,\nfragmentary, and full of a kind of racing speed. He realized suddenly\nthat he had never seen her in the daylight before.\n\nMeanwhile, it was decided that it was too late to go in search of ruins\nas they had intended; and the whole party began to walk towards the\nstables where the carriage had been put up.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Katharine, keeping slightly in advance of the rest\nwith Ralph, \"I thought I saw you this morning, standing at a window.\nBut I decided that it couldn t be you. And it must have been you all\nthe same.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought I saw you but it wasn t you,\" he replied.\n\nThis remark, and the rough strain in his voice, recalled to her memory\nso many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked\ndirectly back to the London drawing-room, the family relics, and the\ntea-table; and at the same time recalled some half-finished or\ninterrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from\nhim she could not remember what it was.\n\n\"I expect it was me,\" she said. \"I was looking for my mother. It\nhappens every time we come to Lincoln. In fact, there never was a\nfamily so unable to take care of itself as ours is. Not that it very\nmuch matters, because some one always turns up in the nick of time to\nhelp us out of our scrapes. Once I was left in a field with a bull when\nI was a baby but where did we leave the carriage? Down that street or\nthe next? The next, I think.\" She glanced back and saw that the others\nwere following obediently, listening to certain memories of Lincoln\nupon which Mrs. Hilbery had started. \"But what are you doing here?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"I m buying a cottage. I m going to live here as soon as I can find a\ncottage, and Mary tells me there ll be no difficulty about that.\"\n\n\"But,\" she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise, \"you will\ngive up the Bar, then?\" It flashed across her mind that he must already\nbe engaged to Mary.\n\n\"The solicitor s office? Yes. I m giving that up.\"\n\n\"But why?\" she asked. She answered herself at once, with a curious\nchange from rapid speech to an almost melancholy tone. \"I think you re\nvery wise to give it up. You will be much happier.\"\n\nAt this very moment, when her words seemed to be striking a path into\nthe future for him, they stepped into the yard of an inn, and there\nbeheld the family coach of the Otways, to which one sleek horse was\nalready attached, while the second was being led out of the stable door\nby the hostler.\n\n\"I don t know what one means by happiness,\" he said briefly, having to\nstep aside in order to avoid a groom with a bucket. \"Why do you think I\nshall be happy? I don t expect to be anything of the kind. I expect to\nbe rather less unhappy. I shall write a book and curse my charwoman if\nhappiness consists in that. What do you think?\"\n\nShe could not answer because they were immediately surrounded by other\nmembers of the party by Mrs. Hilbery, and Mary, Henry Otway, and\nWilliam.\n\nRodney went up to Katharine immediately and said to her:\n\n\"Henry is going to drive home with your mother, and I suggest that they\nshould put us down half-way and let us walk back.\"\n\nKatharine nodded her head. She glanced at him with an oddly furtive\nexpression.\n\n\"Unfortunately we go in opposite directions, or we might have given you\na lift,\" he continued to Denham. His manner was unusually peremptory;\nhe seemed anxious to hasten the departure, and Katharine looked at him\nfrom time to time, as Denham noticed, with an expression half of\ninquiry, half of annoyance. She at once helped her mother into her\ncloak, and said to Mary:\n\n\"I want to see you. Are you going back to London at once? I will\nwrite.\" She half smiled at Ralph, but her look was a little overcast by\nsomething she was thinking, and in a very few minutes the Otway\ncarriage rolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high road\nleading to the village of Lampsher.\n\nThe return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home had been\nin the morning; indeed, Mrs. Hilbery leant back with closed eyes in her\ncorner, and either slept or feigned sleep, as her habit was in the\nintervals between the seasons of active exertion, or continued the\nstory which she had begun to tell herself that morning.\n\nAbout two miles from Lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit of\nthe heath, a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite, setting forth\nthe gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century who had been\nset upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered from death just as\nhope seemed lost. In summer it was a pleasant place, for the deep woods\non either side murmured, and the heather, which grew thick round the\ngranite pedestal, made the light breeze taste sweetly; in winter the\nsighing of the trees was deepened to a hollow sound, and the heath was\nas gray and almost as solitary as the empty sweep of the clouds above\nit.\n\nHere Rodney stopped the carriage and helped Katharine to alight. Henry,\ntoo, gave her his hand, and fancied that she pressed it very slightly\nin parting as if she sent him a message. But the carriage rolled on\nimmediately, without wakening Mrs. Hilbery, and left the couple\nstanding by the obelisk. That Rodney was angry with her and had made\nthis opportunity for speaking to her, Katharine knew very well; she was\nneither glad nor sorry that the time had come, nor, indeed, knew what\nto expect, and thus remained silent. The carriage grew smaller and\nsmaller upon the dusky road, and still Rodney did not speak. Perhaps,\nshe thought, he waited until the last sign of the carriage had\ndisappeared beneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely\nalone. To cloak their silence she read the writing on the obelisk, to\ndo which she had to walk completely round it. She was murmuring a word\nto two of the pious lady s thanks above her breath when Rodney joined\nher. In silence they set out along the cart-track which skirted the\nverge of the trees.\n\nTo break the silence was exactly what Rodney wished to do, and yet\ncould not do to his own satisfaction. In company it was far easier to\napproach Katharine; alone with her, the aloofness and force of her\ncharacter checked all his natural methods of attack. He believed that\nshe had behaved very badly to him, but each separate instance of\nunkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone\ntogether.\n\n\"There s no need for us to race,\" he complained at last; upon which she\nimmediately slackened her pace, and walked too slowly to suit him. In\ndesperation he said the first thing he thought of, very peevishly and\nwithout the dignified prelude which he had intended.\n\n\"I ve not enjoyed my holiday.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. I shall be glad to get back to work again.\"\n\n\"Saturday, Sunday, Monday there are only three days more,\" she counted.\n\n\"No one enjoys being made a fool of before other people,\" he blurted\nout, for his irritation rose as she spoke, and got the better of his\nawe of her, and was inflamed by that awe.\n\n\"That refers to me, I suppose,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"Every day since we ve been here you ve done something to make me\nappear ridiculous,\" he went on. \"Of course, so long as it amuses you,\nyou re welcome; but we have to remember that we are going to spend our\nlives together. I asked you, only this morning, for example, to come\nout and take a turn with me in the garden. I was waiting for you ten\nminutes, and you never came. Every one saw me waiting. The stable-boys\nsaw me. I was so ashamed that I went in. Then, on the drive you hardly\nspoke to me. Henry noticed it. Every one notices it.... You find no\ndifficulty in talking to Henry, though.\"\n\nShe noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to\nanswer none of them, although the last stung her to considerable\nirritation. She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay.\n\n\"None of these things seem to me to matter,\" she said.\n\n\"Very well, then. I may as well hold my tongue,\" he replied.\n\n\"In themselves they don t seem to me to matter; if they hurt you, of\ncourse they matter,\" she corrected herself scrupulously. Her tone of\nconsideration touched him, and he walked on in silence for a space.\n\n\"And we might be so happy, Katharine!\" he exclaimed impulsively, and\ndrew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly.\n\n\"As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy,\"\nshe said.\n\nThe harshness, which Henry had noticed, was again unmistakable in her\nmanner. William flinched and was silent. Such severity, accompanied by\nsomething indescribably cold and impersonal in her manner, had\nconstantly been meted out to him during the last few days, always in\nthe company of others. He had recouped himself by some ridiculous\ndisplay of vanity which, as he knew, put him still more at her mercy.\nNow that he was alone with her there was no stimulus from outside to\ndraw his attention from his injury. By a considerable effort of\nself-control he forced himself to remain silent, and to make himself\ndistinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity, what part to the\ncertainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus.\n\n\"What do I feel about Katharine?\" he thought to himself. It was clear\nthat she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure, the\nmistress of her little section of the world; but more than that, she\nwas the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life,\nthe woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady, as his had\nnever been in spite of all his culture. And then he could not see her\ncome into a room without a sense of the flowing of robes, of the\nflowering of blossoms, of the purple waves of the sea, of all things\nthat are lovely and mutable on the surface but still and passionate in\ntheir heart.\n\n\"If she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh at me\nI couldn t have felt that about her,\" he thought. \"I m not a fool,\nafter all. I can t have been utterly mistaken all these years. And yet,\nwhen she speaks to me like that! The truth of it is,\" he thought, \"that\nI ve got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me\nlike that. Katharine is quite right. And yet those are not my serious\nfeelings, as she knows quite well. How can I change myself? What would\nmake her care for me?\" He was terribly tempted here to break the\nsilence by asking Katharine in what respects he could change himself to\nsuit her; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of\nhis gifts and acquirements, his knowledge of Greek and Latin, his\nknowledge of art and literature, his skill in the management of meters,\nand his ancient west-country blood. But the feeling that underlay all\nthese feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the\ncertainty that he loved Katharine as sincerely as he had it in him to\nlove any one. And yet she could speak to him like that! In a sort of\nbewilderment he lost all desire to speak, and would quite readily have\ntaken up some different topic of conversation if Katharine had started\none. This, however, she did not do.\n\nHe glanced at her, in case her expression might help him to understand\nher behavior. As usual, she had quickened her pace unconsciously, and\nwas now walking a little in front of him; but he could gain little\ninformation from her eyes, which looked steadily at the brown heather,\nor from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead. Thus to lose touch\nwith her, for he had no idea what she was thinking, was so unpleasant\nto him that he began to talk about his grievances again, without,\nhowever, much conviction in his voice.\n\n\"If you have no feeling for me, wouldn t it be kinder to say so to me\nin private?\"\n\n\"Oh, William,\" she burst out, as if he had interrupted some absorbing\ntrain of thought, \"how you go on about feelings! Isn t it better not to\ntalk so much, not to be worrying always about small things that don t\nreally matter?\"\n\n\"That s the question precisely,\" he exclaimed. \"I only want you to tell\nme that they don t matter. There are times when you seem indifferent to\neverything. I m vain, I ve a thousand faults; but you know they re not\neverything; you know I care for you.\"\n\n\"And if I say that I care for you, don t you believe me?\"\n\n\"Say it, Katharine! Say it as if you meant it! Make me feel that you\ncare for me!\"\n\nShe could not force herself to speak a word. The heather was growing\ndim around them, and the horizon was blotted out by white mist. To ask\nher for passion or for certainty seemed like asking that damp prospect\nfor fierce blades of fire, or the faded sky for the intense blue vault\nof June.\n\nHe went on now to tell her of his love for her, in words which bore,\neven to her critical senses, the stamp of truth; but none of this\ntouched her, until, coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty, he heaved\nit open with his shoulder, still talking and taking no account of his\neffort. The virility of this deed impressed her; and yet, normally, she\nattached no value to the power of opening gates. The strength of\nmuscles has nothing to do on the face of it with the strength of\naffections; nevertheless, she felt a sudden concern for this power\nrunning to waste on her account, which, combined with a desire to keep\npossession of that strangely attractive masculine power, made her rouse\nherself from her torpor.\n\nWhy should she not simply tell him the truth which was that she had\naccepted him in a misty state of mind when nothing had its right shape\nor size? that it was deplorable, but that with clearer eyesight\nmarriage was out of the question? She did not want to marry any one.\nShe wanted to go away by herself, preferably to some bleak northern\nmoor, and there study mathematics and the science of astronomy. Twenty\nwords would explain the whole situation to him. He had ceased to speak;\nhe had told her once more how he loved her and why. She summoned her\ncourage, fixed her eyes upon a lightning-splintered ash-tree, and,\nalmost as if she were reading a writing fixed to the trunk, began:\n\n\"I was wrong to get engaged to you. I shall never make you happy. I\nhave never loved you.\"\n\n\"Katharine!\" he protested.\n\n\"No, never,\" she repeated obstinately. \"Not rightly. Don t you see, I\ndidn t know what I was doing?\"\n\n\"You love some one else?\" he cut her short.\n\n\"Absolutely no one.\"\n\n\"Henry?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Henry? I should have thought, William, even you \"\n\n\"There is some one,\" he persisted. \"There has been a change in the last\nfew weeks. You owe it to me to be honest, Katharine.\"\n\n\"If I could, I would,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why did you tell me you would marry me, then?\" he demanded.\n\nWhy, indeed? A moment of pessimism, a sudden conviction of the\nundeniable prose of life, a lapse of the illusion which sustains youth\nmidway between heaven and earth, a desperate attempt to reconcile\nherself with facts she could only recall a moment, as of waking from a\ndream, which now seemed to her a moment of surrender. But who could\ngive reasons such as these for doing what she had done? She shook her\nhead very sadly.\n\n\"But you re not a child you re not a woman of moods,\" Rodney persisted.\n\"You couldn t have accepted me if you hadn t loved me!\" he cried.\n\nA sense of her own misbehavior, which she had succeeded in keeping from\nher by sharpening her consciousness of Rodney s faults, now swept over\nher and almost overwhelmed her. What were his faults in comparison with\nthe fact that he cared for her? What were her virtues in comparison\nwith the fact that she did not care for him? In a flash the conviction\nthat not to care is the uttermost sin of all stamped itself upon her\ninmost thought; and she felt herself branded for ever.\n\nHe had taken her arm, and held her hand firmly in his, nor had she the\nforce to resist what now seemed to her his enormously superior\nstrength. Very well; she would submit, as her mother and her aunt and\nmost women, perhaps, had submitted; and yet she knew that every second\nof such submission to his strength was a second of treachery to him.\n\n\"I did say I would marry you, but it was wrong,\" she forced herself to\nsay, and she stiffened her arm as if to annul even the seeming\nsubmission of that separate part of her; \"for I don t love you,\nWilliam; you ve noticed it, every one s noticed it; why should we go on\npretending? When I told you I loved you, I was wrong. I said what I\nknew to be untrue.\"\n\nAs none of her words seemed to her at all adequate to represent what\nshe felt, she repeated them, and emphasized them without realizing the\neffect that they might have upon a man who cared for her. She was\ncompletely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly dropped; then she\nsaw his face most strangely contorted; was he laughing, it flashed\nacross her? In another moment she saw that he was in tears. In her\nbewilderment at this apparition she stood aghast for a second. With a\ndesperate sense that this horror must, at all costs, be stopped, she\nthen put her arms about him, drew his head for a moment upon her\nshoulder, and led him on, murmuring words of consolation, until he\nheaved a great sigh. They held fast to each other; her tears, too, ran\ndown her cheeks; and were both quite silent. Noticing the difficulty\nwith which he walked, and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own\nlimbs, she proposed that they should rest for a moment where the\nbracken was brown and shriveled beneath an oak-tree. He assented. Once\nmore he gave a great sigh, and wiped his eyes with a childlike\nunconsciousness, and began to speak without a trace of his previous\nanger. The idea came to her that they were like the children in the\nfairy tale who were lost in a wood, and with this in her mind she\nnoticed the scattering of dead leaves all round them which had been\nblown by the wind into heaps, a foot or two deep, here and there.\n\n\"When did you begin to feel this, Katharine?\" he said; \"for it isn t\ntrue to say that you ve always felt it. I admit I was unreasonable the\nfirst night when you found that your clothes had been left behind.\nStill, where s the fault in that? I could promise you never to\ninterfere with your clothes again. I admit I was cross when I found you\nupstairs with Henry. Perhaps I showed it too openly. But that s not\nunreasonable either when one s engaged. Ask your mother. And now this\nterrible thing \" He broke off, unable for the moment to proceed any\nfurther. \"This decision you say you ve come to have you discussed it\nwith any one? Your mother, for example, or Henry?\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" she said, stirring the leaves with her hand.\n\"But you don t understand me, William \"\n\n\"Help me to understand you \"\n\n\"You don t understand, I mean, my real feelings; how could you? I ve\nonly now faced them myself. But I haven t got the sort of feeling love,\nI mean I don t know what to call it\" she looked vaguely towards the\nhorizon sunk under mist \"but, anyhow, without it our marriage would be\na farce \"\n\n\"How a farce?\" he asked. \"But this kind of analysis is disastrous!\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"I should have done it before,\" she said gloomily.\n\n\"You make yourself think things you don t think,\" he continued,\nbecoming demonstrative with his hands, as his manner was. \"Believe me,\nKatharine, before we came here we were perfectly happy. You were full\nof plans for our house the chair-covers, don t you remember? like any\nother woman who is about to be married. Now, for no reason whatever,\nyou begin to fret about your feeling and about my feeling, with the\nusual result. I assure you, Katharine, I ve been through it all myself.\nAt one time I was always asking myself absurd questions which came to\nnothing either. What you want, if I may say so, is some occupation to\ntake you out of yourself when this morbid mood comes on. If it hadn t\nbeen for my poetry, I assure you, I should often have been very much in\nthe same state myself. To let you into a secret,\" he continued, with\nhis little chuckle, which now sounded almost assured, \"I ve often gone\nhome from seeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force\nmyself to write a page or two before I could get you out of my head.\nAsk Denham; he ll tell you how he met me one night; he ll tell you what\na state he found me in.\"\n\nKatharine started with displeasure at the mention of Ralph s name. The\nthought of the conversation in which her conduct had been made a\nsubject for discussion with Denham roused her anger; but, as she\ninstantly felt, she had scarcely the right to grudge William any use of\nher name, seeing what her fault against him had been from first to\nlast. And yet Denham! She had a view of him as a judge. She figured him\nsternly weighing instances of her levity in this masculine court of\ninquiry into feminine morality and gruffly dismissing both her and her\nfamily with some half-sarcastic, half-tolerant phrase which sealed her\ndoom, as far as he was concerned, for ever. Having met him so lately,\nthe sense of his character was strong in her. The thought was not a\npleasant one for a proud woman, but she had yet to learn the art of\nsubduing her expression. Her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows\ndrawn together, gave William a very fair picture of the resentment that\nshe was forcing herself to control. A certain degree of apprehension,\noccasionally culminating in a kind of fear, had always entered into his\nlove for her, and had increased, rather to his surprise, in the greater\nintimacy of their engagement. Beneath her steady, exemplary surface ran\na vein of passion which seemed to him now perverse, now completely\nirrational, for it never took the normal channel of glorification of\nhim and his doings; and, indeed, he almost preferred the steady good\nsense, which had always marked their relationship, to a more romantic\nbond. But passion she had, he could not deny it, and hitherto he had\ntried to see it employed in his thoughts upon the lives of the children\nwho were to be born to them.\n\n\"She will make a perfect mother a mother of sons,\" he thought; but\nseeing her sitting there, gloomy and silent, he began to have his\ndoubts on this point. \"A farce, a farce,\" he thought to himself. \"She\nsaid that our marriage would be a farce,\" and he became suddenly aware\nof their situation, sitting upon the ground, among the dead leaves, not\nfifty yards from the main road, so that it was quite possible for some\none passing to see and recognize them. He brushed off his face any\ntrace that might remain of that unseemly exhibition of emotion. But he\nwas more troubled by Katharine s appearance, as she sat rapt in thought\nupon the ground, than by his own; there was something improper to him\nin her self-forgetfulness. A man naturally alive to the conventions of\nsociety, he was strictly conventional where women were concerned, and\nespecially if the women happened to be in any way connected with him.\nHe noticed with distress the long strand of dark hair touching her\nshoulder and two or three dead beech-leaves attached to her dress; but\nto recall her mind in their present circumstances to a sense of these\ndetails was impossible. She sat there, seeming unconscious of\neverything. He suspected that in her silence she was reproaching\nherself; but he wished that she would think of her hair and of the dead\nbeech-leaves, which were of more immediate importance to him than\nanything else. Indeed, these trifles drew his attention strangely from\nhis own doubtful and uneasy state of mind; for relief, mixing itself\nwith pain, stirred up a most curious hurry and tumult in his breast,\nalmost concealing his first sharp sense of bleak and overwhelming\ndisappointment. In order to relieve this restlessness and close a\ndistressingly ill-ordered scene, he rose abruptly and helped Katharine\nto her feet. She smiled a little at the minute care with which he\ntidied her and yet, when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat,\nshe flinched, seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man.\n\n\"William,\" she said, \"I will marry you. I will try to make you happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIX\n\n\nThe afternoon was already growing dark when the two other wayfarers,\nMary and Ralph Denham, came out on the high road beyond the outskirts\nof Lincoln. The high road, as they both felt, was better suited to this\nreturn journey than the open country, and for the first mile or so of\nthe way they spoke little. In his own mind Ralph was following the\npassage of the Otway carriage over the heath; he then went back to the\nfive or ten minutes that he had spent with Katharine, and examined each\nword with the care that a scholar displays upon the irregularities of\nan ancient text. He was determined that the glow, the romance, the\natmosphere of this meeting should not paint what he must in future\nregard as sober facts. On her side Mary was silent, not because her\nthoughts took much handling, but because her mind seemed empty of\nthought as her heart of feeling. Only Ralph s presence, as she knew,\npreserved this numbness, for she could foresee a time of loneliness\nwhen many varieties of pain would beset her. At the present moment her\neffort was to preserve what she could of the wreck of her self-respect,\nfor such she deemed that momentary glimpse of her love so involuntarily\nrevealed to Ralph. In the light of reason it did not much matter,\nperhaps, but it was her instinct to be careful of that vision of\nherself which keeps pace so evenly beside every one of us, and had been\ndamaged by her confession. The gray night coming down over the country\nwas kind to her; and she thought that one of these days she would find\ncomfort in sitting upon the earth, alone, beneath a tree. Looking\nthrough the darkness, she marked the swelling ground and the tree.\nRalph made her start by saying abruptly;\n\n\"What I was going to say when we were interrupted at lunch was that if\nyou go to America I shall come, too. It can t be harder to earn a\nliving there than it is here. However, that s not the point. The point\nis, Mary, that I want to marry you. Well, what do you say?\" He spoke\nfirmly, waited for no answer, and took her arm in his. \"You know me by\nthis time, the good and the bad,\" he went on. \"You know my tempers.\nI ve tried to let you know my faults. Well, what do you say, Mary?\"\n\nShe said nothing, but this did not seem to strike him.\n\n\"In most ways, at least in the important ways, as you said, we know\neach other and we think alike. I believe you are the only person in the\nworld I could live with happily. And if you feel the same about me as\nyou do, don t you, Mary? we should make each other happy.\" Here he\npaused, and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer; he seemed, indeed,\nto be continuing his own thoughts.\n\n\"Yes, but I m afraid I couldn t do it,\" Mary said at last. The casual\nand rather hurried way in which she spoke, together with the fact that\nshe was saying the exact opposite of what he expected her to say,\nbaffled him so much that he instinctively loosened his clasp upon her\narm and she withdrew it quietly.\n\n\"You couldn t do it?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I couldn t marry you,\" she replied.\n\n\"You don t care for me?\"\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n\"Well, Mary,\" he said, with a curious laugh, \"I must be an arrant fool,\nfor I thought you did.\" They walked for a minute or two in silence, and\nsuddenly he turned to her, looked at her, and exclaimed: \"I don t\nbelieve you, Mary. You re not telling me the truth.\"\n\n\"I m too tired to argue, Ralph,\" she replied, turning her head away\nfrom him. \"I ask you to believe what I say. I can t marry you; I don t\nwant to marry you.\"\n\nThe voice in which she stated this was so evidently the voice of one in\nsome extremity of anguish that Ralph had no course but to obey her. And\nas soon as the tone of her voice had died out, and the surprise faded\nfrom his mind, he found himself believing that she had spoken the\ntruth, for he had but little vanity, and soon her refusal seemed a\nnatural thing to him. He slipped through all the grades of despondency\nuntil he reached a bottom of absolute gloom. Failure seemed to mark the\nwhole of his life; he had failed with Katharine, and now he had failed\nwith Mary. Up at once sprang the thought of Katharine, and with it a\nsense of exulting freedom, but this he checked instantly. No good had\never come to him from Katharine; his whole relationship with her had\nbeen made up of dreams; and as he thought of the little substance there\nhad been in his dreams he began to lay the blame of the present\ncatastrophe upon his dreams.\n\n\"Haven t I always been thinking of Katharine while I was with Mary? I\nmight have loved Mary if it hadn t been for that idiocy of mine. She\ncared for me once, I m certain of that, but I tormented her so with my\nhumors that I let my chances slip, and now she won t risk marrying me.\nAnd this is what I ve made of my life nothing, nothing, nothing.\"\n\nThe tramp of their boots upon the dry road seemed to asseverate\nnothing, nothing, nothing. Mary thought that this silence was the\nsilence of relief; his depression she ascribed to the fact that he had\nseen Katharine and parted from her, leaving her in the company of\nWilliam Rodney. She could not blame him for loving Katharine, but that,\nwhen he loved another, he should ask her to marry him that seemed to\nher the cruellest treachery. Their old friendship and its firm base\nupon indestructible qualities of character crumbled, and her whole past\nseemed foolish, herself weak and credulous, and Ralph merely the shell\nof an honest man. Oh, the past so much made up of Ralph; and now, as\nshe saw, made up of something strange and false and other than she had\nthought it. She tried to recapture a saying she had made to help\nherself that morning, as Ralph paid the bill for luncheon; but she\ncould see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the\nphrase. Something about truth was in it; how to see the truth is our\ngreat chance in this world.\n\n\"If you don t want to marry me,\" Ralph now began again, without\nabruptness, with diffidence rather, \"there is no need why we should\ncease to see each other, is there? Or would you rather that we should\nkeep apart for the present?\"\n\n\"Keep apart? I don t know I must think about it.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing, Mary,\" he resumed; \"have I done anything to make\nyou change your mind about me?\"\n\nShe was immensely tempted to give way to her natural trust in him,\nrevived by the deep and now melancholy tones of his voice, and to tell\nhim of her love, and of what had changed it. But although it seemed\nlikely that she would soon control her anger with him, the certainty\nthat he did not love her, confirmed by every word of his proposal,\nforbade any freedom of speech. To hear him speak and to feel herself\nunable to reply, or constrained in her replies, was so painful that she\nlonged for the time when she should be alone. A more pliant woman would\nhave taken this chance of an explanation, whatever risks attached to\nit; but to one of Mary s firm and resolute temperament there was\ndegradation in the idea of self-abandonment; let the waves of emotion\nrise ever so high, she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to\nbe the truth. Her silence puzzled Ralph. He searched his memory for\nwords or deeds that might have made her think badly of him. In his\npresent mood instances came but too quickly, and on top of them this\nculminating proof of his baseness that he had asked her to marry him\nwhen his reasons for such a proposal were selfish and half-hearted.\n\n\"You needn t answer,\" he said grimly. \"There are reasons enough, I\nknow. But must they kill our friendship, Mary? Let me keep that, at\nleast.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she thought to herself, with a sudden rush of anguish which\nthreatened disaster to her self-respect, \"it has come to this to\nthis when I could have given him everything!\"\n\n\"Yes, we can still be friends,\" she said, with what firmness she could\nmuster.\n\n\"I shall want your friendship,\" he said. He added, \"If you find it\npossible, let me see you as often as you can. The oftener the better. I\nshall want your help.\"\n\nShe promised this, and they went on to talk calmly of things that had\nno reference to their feelings a talk which, in its constraint, was\ninfinitely sad to both of them.\n\nOne more reference was made to the state of things between them late\nthat night, when Elizabeth had gone to her room, and the two young men\nhad stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt\nthe floor beneath their feet after a day s shooting.\n\nMary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire, for the logs were\nburning low, and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to\nreplenish them. Ralph was reading, but she had noticed for some time\nthat his eyes instead of following the print were fixed rather above\nthe page with an intensity of gloom that came to weigh upon her mind.\nShe had not weakened in her resolve not to give way, for reflection had\nonly made her more bitterly certain that, if she gave way, it would be\nto her own wish and not to his. But she had determined that there was\nno reason why he should suffer if her reticence were the cause of his\nsuffering. Therefore, although she found it painful, she spoke:\n\n\"You asked me if I had changed my mind about you, Ralph,\" she said. \"I\nthink there s only one thing. When you asked me to marry you, I don t\nthink you meant it. That made me angry for the moment. Before, you d\nalways spoken the truth.\"\n\nRalph s book slid down upon his knee and fell upon the floor. He rested\nhis forehead on his hand and looked into the fire. He was trying to\nrecall the exact words in which he had made his proposal to Mary.\n\n\"I never said I loved you,\" he said at last.\n\nShe winced; but she respected him for saying what he did, for this,\nafter all, was a fragment of the truth which she had vowed to live by.\n\n\"And to me marriage without love doesn t seem worth while,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, Mary, I m not going to press you,\" he said. \"I see you don t\nwant to marry me. But love don t we all talk a great deal of nonsense\nabout it? What does one mean? I believe I care for you more genuinely\nthan nine men out of ten care for the women they re in love with. It s\nonly a story one makes up in one s mind about another person, and one\nknows all the time it isn t true. Of course one knows; why, one s\nalways taking care not to destroy the illusion. One takes care not to\nsee them too often, or to be alone with them for too long together.\nIt s a pleasant illusion, but if you re thinking of the risks of\nmarriage, it seems to me that the risk of marrying a person you re in\nlove with is something colossal.\"\n\n\"I don t believe a word of that, and what s more you don t, either,\"\nshe replied with anger. \"However, we don t agree; I only wanted you to\nunderstand.\" She shifted her position, as if she were about to go. An\ninstinctive desire to prevent her from leaving the room made Ralph rise\nat this point and begin pacing up and down the nearly empty kitchen,\nchecking his desire, each time he reached the door, to open it and step\nout into the garden. A moralist might have said that at this point his\nmind should have been full of self-reproach for the suffering he had\ncaused. On the contrary, he was extremely angry, with the confused\nimpotent anger of one who finds himself unreasonably but efficiently\nfrustrated. He was trapped by the illogicality of human life. The\nobstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial, and\nyet he could see no way of removing them. Mary s words, the tone of her\nvoice even, angered him, for she would not help him. She was part of\nthe insanely jumbled muddle of a world which impedes the sensible life.\nHe would have liked to slam the door or break the hind legs of a chair,\nfor the obstacles had taken some such curiously substantial shape in\nhis mind.\n\n\"I doubt that one human being ever understands another,\" he said,\nstopping in his march and confronting Mary at a distance of a few feet.\n\n\"Such damned liars as we all are, how can we? But we can try. If you\ndon t want to marry me, don t; but the position you take up about love,\nand not seeing each other isn t that mere sentimentality? You think\nI ve behaved very badly,\" he continued, as she did not speak. \"Of\ncourse I behave badly; but you can t judge people by what they do. You\ncan t go through life measuring right and wrong with a foot-rule.\nThat s what you re always doing, Mary; that s what you re doing now.\"\n\nShe saw herself in the Suffrage Office, delivering judgment, meting out\nright and wrong, and there seemed to her to be some justice in the\ncharge, although it did not affect her main position.\n\n\"I m not angry with you,\" she said slowly. \"I will go on seeing you, as\nI said I would.\"\n\nIt was true that she had promised that much already, and it was\ndifficult for him to say what more it was that he wanted some intimacy,\nsome help against the ghost of Katharine, perhaps, something that he\nknew he had no right to ask; and yet, as he sank into his chair and\nlooked once more at the dying fire it seemed to him that he had been\ndefeated, not so much by Mary as by life itself. He felt himself thrown\nback to the beginning of life again, where everything has yet to be\nwon; but in extreme youth one has an ignorant hope. He was no longer\ncertain that he would triumph.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XX\n\n\nHappily for Mary Datchet she returned to the office to find that by\nsome obscure Parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more slipped\nbeyond the attainment of women. Mrs. Seal was in a condition bordering\nupon frenzy. The duplicity of Ministers, the treachery of mankind, the\ninsult to womanhood, the setback to civilization, the ruin of her\nlife s work, the feelings of her father s daughter all these topics\nwere discussed in turn, and the office was littered with newspaper\ncuttings branded with the blue, if ambiguous, marks of her displeasure.\nShe confessed herself at fault in her estimate of human nature.\n\n\"The simple elementary acts of justice,\" she said, waving her hand\ntowards the window, and indicating the foot-passengers and omnibuses\nthen passing down the far side of Russell Square, \"are as far beyond\nthem as they ever were. We can only look upon ourselves, Mary, as\npioneers in a wilderness. We can only go on patiently putting the truth\nbefore them. It isn t _them_,\" she continued, taking heart from her\nsight of the traffic, \"it s their leaders. It s those gentlemen sitting\nin Parliament and drawing four hundred a year of the people s money. If\nwe had to put our case to the people, we should soon have justice done\nto us. I have always believed in the people, and I do so still. But \"\nShe shook her head and implied that she would give them one more\nchance, and if they didn t take advantage of that she couldn t answer\nfor the consequences.\n\nMr. Clacton s attitude was more philosophical and better supported by\nstatistics. He came into the room after Mrs. Seal s outburst and\npointed out, with historical illustrations, that such reverses had\nhappened in every political campaign of any importance. If anything,\nhis spirits were improved by the disaster. The enemy, he said, had\ntaken the offensive; and it was now up to the Society to outwit the\nenemy. He gave Mary to understand that he had taken the measure of\ntheir cunning, and had already bent his mind to the task which, so far\nas she could make out, depended solely upon him. It depended, so she\ncame to think, when invited into his room for a private conference,\nupon a systematic revision of the card-index, upon the issue of certain\nnew lemon-colored leaflets, in which the facts were marshaled once more\nin a very striking way, and upon a large scale map of England dotted\nwith little pins tufted with differently colored plumes of hair\naccording to their geographical position. Each district, under the new\nsystem, had its flag, its bottle of ink, its sheaf of documents\ntabulated and filed for reference in a drawer, so that by looking under\nM or S, as the case might be, you had all the facts with respect to the\nSuffrage organizations of that county at your fingers  ends. This would\nrequire a great deal of work, of course.\n\n\"We must try to consider ourselves rather in the light of a telephone\nexchange for the exchange of ideas, Miss Datchet,\" he said; and taking\npleasure in his image, he continued it. \"We should consider ourselves\nthe center of an enormous system of wires, connecting us up with every\ndistrict of the country. We must have our fingers upon the pulse of the\ncommunity; we want to know what people all over England are thinking;\nwe want to put them in the way of thinking rightly.\" The system, of\ncourse, was only roughly sketched so far jotted down, in fact, during\nthe Christmas holidays.\n\n\"When you ought to have been taking a rest, Mr. Clacton,\" said Mary\ndutifully, but her tone was flat and tired.\n\n\"We learn to do without holidays, Miss Datchet,\" said Mr. Clacton, with\na spark of satisfaction in his eye.\n\nHe wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon-colored\nleaflet. According to his plan, it was to be distributed in immense\nquantities immediately, in order to stimulate and generate, \"to\ngenerate and stimulate,\" he repeated, \"right thoughts in the country\nbefore the meeting of Parliament.\"\n\n\"We have to take the enemy by surprise,\" he said. \"They don t let the\ngrass grow under their feet. Have you seen Bingham s address to his\nconstituents? That s a hint of the sort of thing we ve got to meet,\nMiss Datchet.\"\n\nHe handed her a great bundle of newspaper cuttings, and, begging her to\ngive him her views upon the yellow leaflet before lunch-time, he turned\nwith alacrity to his different sheets of paper and his different\nbottles of ink.\n\nMary shut the door, laid the documents upon her table, and sank her\nhead on her hands. Her brain was curiously empty of any thought. She\nlistened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged again in\nthe atmosphere of the office. From the next room came the rapid\nspasmodic sounds of Mrs. Seal s erratic typewriting; she, doubtless,\nwas already hard at work helping the people of England, as Mr. Clacton\nput it, to think rightly; \"generating and stimulating,\" those were his\nwords. She was striking a blow against the enemy, no doubt, who didn t\nlet the grass grow beneath their feet. Mr. Clacton s words repeated\nthemselves accurately in her brain. She pushed the papers wearily over\nto the farther side of the table. It was no use, though; something or\nother had happened to her brain a change of focus so that near things\nwere indistinct again. The same thing had happened to her once before,\nshe remembered, after she had met Ralph in the gardens of Lincoln s Inn\nFields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking\nabout sparrows and colors, until, almost at the end of the meeting, her\nold convictions had all come back to her. But they had only come back,\nshe thought with scorn at her feebleness, because she wanted to use\nthem to fight against Ralph. They weren t, rightly speaking,\nconvictions at all. She could not see the world divided into separate\ncompartments of good people and bad people, any more than she could\nbelieve so implicitly in the rightness of her own thought as to wish to\nbring the population of the British Isles into agreement with it. She\nlooked at the lemon-colored leaflet, and thought almost enviously of\nthe faith which could find comfort in the issue of such documents; for\nherself she would be content to remain silent for ever if a share of\npersonal happiness were granted her. She read Mr. Clacton s statement\nwith a curious division of judgment, noting its weak and pompous\nverbosity on the one hand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith,\nfaith in an illusion, perhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something,\nwas of all gifts the most to be envied. An illusion it was, no doubt.\nShe looked curiously round her at the furniture of the office, at the\nmachinery in which she had taken so much pride, and marveled to think\nthat once the copying-presses, the card-index, the files of documents,\nhad all been shrouded, wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and\na general dignity and purpose independently of their separate\nsignificance. The ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed\nher now. Her attitude had become very lax and despondent when the\ntypewriter stopped in the next room. Mary immediately drew up to the\ntable, laid hands on an unopened envelope, and adopted an expression\nwhich might hide her state of mind from Mrs. Seal. Some instinct of\ndecency required that she should not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face.\nShading her eyes with her fingers, she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one\ndrawer after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet. She\nwas tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim:\n\n\"Do sit down, Sally, and tell me how you manage it how you manage, that\nis, to bustle about with perfect confidence in the necessity of your\nown activities, which to me seem as futile as the buzzing of a belated\nblue-bottle.\" She said nothing of the kind, however, and the presence\nof industry which she preserved so long as Mrs. Seal was in the room\nserved to set her brain in motion, so that she dispatched her morning s\nwork much as usual. At one o clock she was surprised to find how\nefficiently she had dealt with the morning. As she put her hat on she\ndetermined to lunch at a shop in the Strand, so as to set that other\npiece of mechanism, her body, into action. With a brain working and a\nbody working one could keep step with the crowd and never be found out\nfor the hollow machine, lacking the essential thing, that one was\nconscious of being.\n\nShe considered her case as she walked down the Charing Cross Road. She\nput to herself a series of questions. Would she mind, for example, if\nthe wheels of that motor-omnibus passed over her and crushed her to\ndeath? No, not in the least; or an adventure with that\ndisagreeable-looking man hanging about the entrance of the Tube\nstation? No; she could not conceive fear or excitement. Did suffering\nin any form appall her? No, suffering was neither good nor bad. And\nthis essential thing? In the eyes of every single person she detected a\nflame; as if a spark in the brain ignited spontaneously at contact with\nthe things they met and drove them on. The young women looking into the\nmilliners  windows had that look in their eyes; and elderly men turning\nover books in the second-hand book-shops, and eagerly waiting to hear\nwhat the price was the very lowest price they had it, too. But she\ncared nothing at all for clothes or for money either. Books she shrank\nfrom, for they were connected too closely with Ralph. She kept on her\nway resolutely through the crowd of people, among whom she was so much\nof an alien, feeling them cleave and give way before her.\n\nStrange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets should the\npassenger, by chance, have no exact destination in front of him, much\nas the mind shapes all kinds of forms, solutions, images when listening\ninattentively to music. From an acute consciousness of herself as an\nindividual, Mary passed to a conception of the scheme of things in\nwhich, as a human being, she must have her share. She half held a\nvision; the vision shaped and dwindled. She wished she had a pencil and\na piece of paper to help her to give a form to this conception which\ncomposed itself as she walked down the Charing Cross Road. But if she\ntalked to any one, the conception might escape her. Her vision seemed\nto lay out the lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied\nher sense of harmony. It only needed a persistent effort of thought,\nstimulated in this strange way by the crowd and the noise, to climb the\ncrest of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever. Already\nher suffering as an individual was left behind her. Of this process,\nwhich was to her so full of effort, which comprised infinitely swift\nand full passages of thought, leading from one crest to another, as she\nshaped her conception of life in this world, only two articulate words\nescaped her, muttered beneath her breath \"Not happiness not happiness.\"\n\nShe sat down on a seat opposite the statue of one of London s heroes\nupon the Embankment, and spoke the words aloud. To her they represented\nthe rare flower or splinter of rock brought down by a climber in proof\nthat he has stood for a moment, at least, upon the highest peak of the\nmountain. She had been up there and seen the world spread to the\nhorizon. It was now necessary to alter her course to some extent,\naccording to her new resolve. Her post should be in one of those\nexposed and desolate stations which are shunned naturally by happy\npeople. She arranged the details of the new plan in her mind, not\nwithout a grim satisfaction.\n\n\"Now,\" she said to herself, rising from her seat, \"I ll think of\nRalph.\"\n\nWhere was he to be placed in the new scale of life? Her exalted mood\nseemed to make it safe to handle the question. But she was dismayed to\nfind how quickly her passions leapt forward the moment she sanctioned\nthis line of thought. Now she was identified with him and rethought his\nthoughts with complete self-surrender; now, with a sudden cleavage of\nspirit, she turned upon him and denounced him for his cruelty.\n\n\"But I refuse I refuse to hate any one,\" she said aloud; chose the\nmoment to cross the road with circumspection, and ten minutes later\nlunched in the Strand, cutting her meat firmly into small pieces, but\ngiving her fellow-diners no further cause to judge her eccentric. Her\nsoliloquy crystallized itself into little fragmentary phrases emerging\nsuddenly from the turbulence of her thought, particularly when she had\nto exert herself in any way, either to move, to count money, or to\nchoose a turning. \"To know the truth to accept without\nbitterness\" those, perhaps, were the most articulate of her utterances,\nfor no one could have made head or tail of the queer gibberish murmured\nin front of the statue of Francis, Duke of Bedford, save that the name\nof Ralph occurred frequently in very strange connections, as if, having\nspoken it, she wished, superstitiously, to cancel it by adding some\nother word that robbed the sentence with his name in it of any meaning.\n\nThose champions of the cause of women, Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal, did\nnot perceive anything strange in Mary s behavior, save that she was\nalmost half an hour later than usual in coming back to the office.\nHappily, their own affairs kept them busy, and she was free from their\ninspection. If they had surprised her they would have found her lost,\napparently, in admiration of the large hotel across the square, for,\nafter writing a few words, her pen rested upon the paper, and her mind\npursued its own journey among the sun-blazoned windows and the drifts\nof purplish smoke which formed her view. And, indeed, this background\nwas by no means out of keeping with her thoughts. She saw to the remote\nspaces behind the strife of the foreground, enabled now to gaze there,\nsince she had renounced her own demands, privileged to see the larger\nview, to share the vast desires and sufferings of the mass of mankind.\nShe had been too lately and too roughly mastered by facts to take an\neasy pleasure in the relief of renunciation; such satisfaction as she\nfelt came only from the discovery that, having renounced everything\nthat made life happy, easy, splendid, individual, there remained a hard\nreality, unimpaired by one s personal adventures, remote as the stars,\nunquenchable as they are.\n\nWhile Mary Datchet was undergoing this curious transformation from the\nparticular to the universal, Mrs. Seal remembered her duties with\nregard to the kettle and the gas-fire. She was a little surprised to\nfind that Mary had drawn her chair to the window, and, having lit the\ngas, she raised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her. The\nmost obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind\nof indisposition. But Mary, rousing herself with an effort, denied that\nshe was indisposed.\n\n\"I m frightfully lazy this afternoon,\" she added, with a glance at her\ntable. \"You must really get another secretary, Sally.\"\n\nThe words were meant to be taken lightly, but something in the tone of\nthem roused a jealous fear which was always dormant in Mrs. Seal s\nbreast. She was terribly afraid that one of these days Mary, the young\nwoman who typified so many rather sentimental and enthusiastic ideas,\nwho had some sort of visionary existence in white with a sheaf of\nlilies in her hand, would announce, in a jaunty way, that she was about\nto be married.\n\n\"You don t mean that you re going to leave us?\" she said.\n\n\"I ve not made up my mind about anything,\" said Mary a remark which\ncould be taken as a generalization.\n\nMrs. Seal got the teacups out of the cupboard and set them on the\ntable.\n\n\"You re not going to be married, are you?\" she asked, pronouncing the\nwords with nervous speed.\n\n\"Why are you asking such absurd questions this afternoon, Sally?\" Mary\nasked, not very steadily. \"Must we all get married?\"\n\nMrs. Seal emitted a most peculiar chuckle. She seemed for one moment to\nacknowledge the terrible side of life which is concerned with the\nemotions, the private lives, of the sexes, and then to sheer off from\nit with all possible speed into the shades of her own shivering\nvirginity. She was made so uncomfortable by the turn the conversation\nhad taken, that she plunged her head into the cupboard, and endeavored\nto abstract some very obscure piece of china.\n\n\"We have our work,\" she said, withdrawing her head, displaying cheeks\nmore than usually crimson, and placing a jam-pot emphatically upon the\ntable. But, for the moment, she was unable to launch herself upon one\nof those enthusiastic, but inconsequent, tirades upon liberty,\ndemocracy, the rights of the people, and the iniquities of the\nGovernment, in which she delighted. Some memory from her own past or\nfrom the past of her sex rose to her mind and kept her abashed. She\nglanced furtively at Mary, who still sat by the window with her arm\nupon the sill. She noticed how young she was and full of the promise of\nwomanhood. The sight made her so uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon\ntheir saucers.\n\n\"Yes enough work to last a lifetime,\" said Mary, as if concluding some\npassage of thought.\n\nMrs. Seal brightened at once. She lamented her lack of scientific\ntraining, and her deficiency in the processes of logic, but she set her\nmind to work at once to make the prospects of the cause appear as\nalluring and important as she could. She delivered herself of an\nharangue in which she asked a great many rhetorical questions and\nanswered them with a little bang of one fist upon another.\n\n\"To last a lifetime? My dear child, it will last all our lifetimes. As\none falls another steps into the breach. My father, in his generation,\na pioneer I, coming after him, do my little best. What, alas! can one\ndo more? And now it s you young women we look to you the future looks\nto you. Ah, my dear, if I d a thousand lives, I d give them all to our\ncause. The cause of women, d you say? I say the cause of humanity. And\nthere are some\" she glanced fiercely at the window \"who don t see it!\nThere are some who are satisfied to go on, year after year, refusing to\nadmit the truth. And we who have the vision the kettle boiling over?\nNo, no, let me see to it we who know the truth,\" she continued,\ngesticulating with the kettle and the teapot. Owing to these\nencumbrances, perhaps, she lost the thread of her discourse, and\nconcluded, rather wistfully, \"It s all so _simple_.\" She referred to a\nmatter that was a perpetual source of bewilderment to her the\nextraordinary incapacity of the human race, in a world where the good\nis so unmistakably divided from the bad, of distinguishing one from the\nother, and embodying what ought to be done in a few large, simple Acts\nof Parliament, which would, in a very short time, completely change the\nlot of humanity.\n\n\"One would have thought,\" she said, \"that men of University training,\nlike Mr. Asquith one would have thought that an appeal to reason would\nnot be unheard by them. But reason,\" she reflected, \"what is reason\nwithout Reality?\"\n\nDoing homage to the phrase, she repeated it once more, and caught the\near of Mr. Clacton, as he issued from his room; and he repeated it a\nthird time, giving it, as he was in the habit of doing with Mrs. Seal s\nphrases, a dryly humorous intonation. He was well pleased with the\nworld, however, and he remarked, in a flattering manner, that he would\nlike to see that phrase in large letters at the head of a leaflet.\n\n\"But, Mrs. Seal, we have to aim at a judicious combination of the two,\"\nhe added in his magisterial way to check the unbalanced enthusiasm of\nthe women. \"Reality has to be voiced by reason before it can make\nitself felt. The weak point of all these movements, Miss Datchet,\" he\ncontinued, taking his place at the table and turning to Mary as usual\nwhen about to deliver his more profound cogitations, \"is that they are\nnot based upon sufficiently intellectual grounds. A mistake, in my\nopinion. The British public likes a pellet of reason in its jam of\neloquence a pill of reason in its pudding of sentiment,\" he said,\nsharpening the phrase to a satisfactory degree of literary precision.\n\nHis eyes rested, with something of the vanity of an author, upon the\nyellow leaflet which Mary held in her hand. She rose, took her seat at\nthe head of the table, poured out tea for her colleagues, and gave her\nopinion upon the leaflet. So she had poured out tea, so she had\ncriticized Mr. Clacton s leaflets a hundred times already; but now it\nseemed to her that she was doing it in a different spirit; she had\nenlisted in the army, and was a volunteer no longer. She had renounced\nsomething and was now how could she express it? not quite \"in the\nrunning\" for life. She had always known that Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal\nwere not in the running, and across the gulf that separated them she\nhad seen them in the guise of shadow people, flitting in and out of the\nranks of the living eccentrics, undeveloped human beings, from whose\nsubstance some essential part had been cut away. All this had never\nstruck her so clearly as it did this afternoon, when she felt that her\nlot was cast with them for ever. One view of the world plunged in\ndarkness, so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a\nseason of despair, let the world turn again and show another, more\nsplendid, perhaps. No, Mary thought, with unflinching loyalty to what\nappeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not\nmean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens, I\nmean to have no presences in my life. Her very words had a sort of\ndistinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp, bodily pain. To Mrs.\nSeal s secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion of shop at\ntea-time was overlooked. Mary and Mr. Clacton argued with a cogency and\na ferocity which made the little woman feel that something very\nimportant she hardly knew what was taking place. She became much\nexcited; one crucifix became entangled with another, and she dug a\nconsiderable hole in the table with the point of her pencil in order to\nemphasize the most striking heads of the discourse; and how any\ncombination of Cabinet Ministers could resist such discourse she really\ndid not know.\n\nShe could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument\nof justice the typewriter. The telephone-bell rang, and as she hurried\noff to answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance by\nitself, she felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface of the\nglobe that all the subterranean wires of thought and progress came\ntogether. When she returned, with a message from the printer, she found\nthat Mary was putting on her hat firmly; there was something imperious\nand dominating in her attitude altogether.\n\n\"Look, Sally,\" she said, \"these letters want copying. These I ve not\nlooked at. The question of the new census will have to be gone into\ncarefully. But I m going home now. Good night, Mr. Clacton; good night,\nSally.\"\n\n\"We are very fortunate in our secretary, Mr. Clacton,\" said Mrs. Seal,\npausing with her hand on the papers, as the door shut behind Mary. Mr.\nClacton himself had been vaguely impressed by something in Mary s\nbehavior towards him. He envisaged a time even when it would become\nnecessary to tell her that there could not be two masters in one\noffice but she was certainly able, very able, and in touch with a group\nof very clever young men. No doubt they had suggested to her some of\nher new ideas.\n\nHe signified his assent to Mrs. Seal s remark, but observed, with a\nglance at the clock, which showed only half an hour past five:\n\n\"If she takes the work seriously, Mrs. Seal but that s just what some\nof your clever young ladies don t do.\" So saying he returned to his\nroom, and Mrs. Seal, after a moment s hesitation, hurried back to her\nlabors.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXI\n\n\nMary walked to the nearest station and reached home in an incredibly\nshort space of time, just so much, indeed, as was needed for the\nintelligent understanding of the news of the world as the \"Westminster\nGazette\" reported it. Within a few minutes of opening her door, she was\nin trim for a hard evening s work. She unlocked a drawer and took out a\nmanuscript, which consisted of a very few pages, entitled, in a\nforcible hand, \"Some Aspects of the Democratic State.\" The aspects\ndwindled out in a cries-cross of blotted lines in the very middle of a\nsentence, and suggested that the author had been interrupted, or\nconvinced of the futility of proceeding, with her pen in the air....\nOh, yes, Ralph had come in at that point. She scored that sheet very\neffectively, and, choosing a fresh one, began at a great rate with a\ngeneralization upon the structure of human society, which was a good\ndeal bolder than her custom. Ralph had told her once that she couldn t\nwrite English, which accounted for those frequent blots and insertions;\nbut she put all that behind her, and drove ahead with such words as\ncame her way, until she had accomplished half a page of generalization\nand might legitimately draw breath. Directly her hand stopped her brain\nstopped too, and she began to listen. A paper-boy shouted down the\nstreet; an omnibus ceased and lurched on again with the heave of duty\nonce more shouldered; the dullness of the sounds suggested that a fog\nhad risen since her return, if, indeed, a fog has power to deaden\nsound, of which fact, she could not be sure at the present moment. It\nwas the sort of fact Ralph Denham knew. At any rate, it was no concern\nof hers, and she was about to dip a pen when her ear was caught by the\nsound of a step upon the stone staircase. She followed it past Mr.\nChippen s chambers; past Mr. Gibson s; past Mr. Turner s; after which\nit became her sound. A postman, a washerwoman, a circular, a bill she\npresented herself with each of these perfectly natural possibilities;\nbut, to her surprise, her mind rejected each one of them impatiently,\neven apprehensively. The step became slow, as it was apt to do at the\nend of the steep climb, and Mary, listening for the regular sound, was\nfilled with an intolerable nervousness. Leaning against the table, she\nfelt the knock of her heart push her body perceptibly backwards and\nforwards a state of nerves astonishing and reprehensible in a stable\nwoman. Grotesque fancies took shape. Alone, at the top of the house, an\nunknown person approaching nearer and nearer how could she escape?\nThere was no way of escape. She did not even know whether that oblong\nmark on the ceiling was a trap-door to the roof or not. And if she got\non to the roof well, there was a drop of sixty feet or so on to the\npavement. But she sat perfectly still, and when the knock sounded, she\ngot up directly and opened the door without hesitation. She saw a tall\nfigure outside, with something ominous to her eyes in the look of it.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she said, not recognizing the face in the fitful\nlight of the staircase.\n\n\"Mary? I m Katharine Hilbery!\"\n\nMary s self-possession returned almost excessively, and her welcome was\ndecidedly cold, as if she must recoup herself for this ridiculous waste\nof emotion. She moved her green-shaded lamp to another table, and\ncovered \"Some Aspects of the Democratic State\" with a sheet of\nblotting-paper.\n\n\"Why can t they leave me alone?\" she thought bitterly, connecting\nKatharine and Ralph in a conspiracy to take from her even this hour of\nsolitary study, even this poor little defence against the world. And,\nas she smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript,\nshe braced herself to resist Katharine, whose presence struck her, not\nmerely by its force, as usual, but as something in the nature of a\nmenace.\n\n\"You re working?\" said Katharine, with hesitation, perceiving that she\nwas not welcome.\n\n\"Nothing that matters,\" Mary replied, drawing forward the best of the\nchairs and poking the fire.\n\n\"I didn t know you had to work after you had left the office,\" said\nKatharine, in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of\nsomething else, as was, indeed, the case.\n\nShe had been paying calls with her mother, and in between the calls\nMrs. Hilbery had rushed into shops and bought pillow-cases and\nblotting-books on no perceptible method for the furnishing of\nKatharine s house. Katharine had a sense of impedimenta accumulating on\nall sides of her. She had left her at length, and had come on to keep\nan engagement to dine with Rodney at his rooms. But she did not mean to\nget to him before seven o clock, and so had plenty of time to walk all\nthe way from Bond Street to the Temple if she wished it. The flow of\nfaces streaming on either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of\nprofound despondency, to which her expectation of an evening alone with\nRodney contributed. They were very good friends again, better friends,\nthey both said, than ever before. So far as she was concerned this was\ntrue. There were many more things in him than she had guessed until\nemotion brought them forth strength, affection, sympathy. And she\nthought of them and looked at the faces passing, and thought how much\nalike they were, and how distant, nobody feeling anything as she felt\nnothing, and distance, she thought, lay inevitably between the closest,\nand their intimacy was the worst presence of all. For, \"Oh dear,\" she\nthought, looking into a tobacconist s window, \"I don t care for any of\nthem, and I don t care for William, and people say this is the thing\nthat matters most, and I can t see what they mean by it.\"\n\nShe looked desperately at the smooth-bowled pipes, and wondered should\nshe walk on by the Strand or by the Embankment? It was not a simple\nquestion, for it concerned not different streets so much as different\nstreams of thought. If she went by the Strand she would force herself\nto think out the problem of the future, or some mathematical problem;\nif she went by the river she would certainly begin to think about\nthings that didn t exist the forest, the ocean beach, the leafy\nsolitudes, the magnanimous hero. No, no, no! A thousand times no! it\nwouldn t do; there was something repulsive in such thoughts at present;\nshe must take something else; she was out of that mood at present. And\nthen she thought of Mary; the thought gave her confidence, even\npleasure of a sad sort, as if the triumph of Ralph and Mary proved that\nthe fault of her failure lay with herself and not with life. An\nindistinct idea that the sight of Mary might be of help, combined with\nher natural trust in her, suggested a visit; for, surely, her liking\nwas of a kind that implied liking upon Mary s side also. After a\nmoment s hesitation she decided, although she seldom acted upon\nimpulse, to act upon this one, and turned down a side street and found\nMary s door. But her reception was not encouraging; clearly Mary didn t\nwant to see her, had no help to impart, and the half-formed desire to\nconfide in her was quenched immediately. She was slightly amused at her\nown delusion, looked rather absent-minded, and swung her gloves to and\nfro, as if doling out the few minutes accurately before she could say\ngood-by.\n\nThose few minutes might very well be spent in asking for information as\nto the exact position of the Suffrage Bill, or in expounding her own\nvery sensible view of the situation. But there was a tone in her voice,\nor a shade in her opinions, or a swing of her gloves which served to\nirritate Mary Datchet, whose manner became increasingly direct, abrupt,\nand even antagonistic. She became conscious of a wish to make Katharine\nrealize the importance of this work, which she discussed so coolly, as\nthough she, too, had sacrificed what Mary herself had sacrificed. The\nswinging of the gloves ceased, and Katharine, after ten minutes, began\nto make movements preliminary to departure. At the sight of this, Mary\nwas aware she was abnormally aware of things to-night of another very\nstrong desire; Katharine was not to be allowed to go, to disappear into\nthe free, happy world of irresponsible individuals. She must be made to\nrealize to feel.\n\n\"I don t quite see,\" she said, as if Katharine had challenged her\nexplicitly, \"how, things being as they are, any one can help trying, at\nleast, to do something.\"\n\n\"No. But how _are_ things?\"\n\nMary pressed her lips, and smiled ironically; she had Katharine at her\nmercy; she could, if she liked, discharge upon her head wagon-loads of\nrevolting proof of the state of things ignored by the casual, the\namateur, the looker-on, the cynical observer of life at a distance. And\nyet she hesitated. As usual, when she found herself in talk with\nKatharine, she began to feel rapid alternations of opinion about her,\narrows of sensation striking strangely through the envelope of\npersonality, which shelters us so conveniently from our fellows. What\nan egoist, how aloof she was! And yet, not in her words, perhaps, but\nin her voice, in her face, in her attitude, there were signs of a soft\nbrooding spirit, of a sensibility unblunted and profound, playing over\nher thoughts and deeds, and investing her manner with an habitual\ngentleness. The arguments and phrases of Mr. Clacton fell flat against\nsuch armor.\n\n\"You ll be married, and you ll have other things to think of,\" she said\ninconsequently, and with an accent of condescension. She was not going\nto make Katharine understand in a second, as she would, all she herself\nhad learnt at the cost of such pain. No. Katharine was to be happy;\nKatharine was to be ignorant; Mary was to keep this knowledge of the\nimpersonal life for herself. The thought of her morning s renunciation\nstung her conscience, and she tried to expand once more into that\nimpersonal condition which was so lofty and so painless. She must check\nthis desire to be an individual again, whose wishes were in conflict\nwith those of other people. She repented of her bitterness.\n\nKatharine now renewed her signs of leave-taking; she had drawn on one\nof her gloves, and looked about her as if in search of some trivial\nsaying to end with. Wasn t there some picture, or clock, or chest of\ndrawers which might be singled out for notice? something peaceable and\nfriendly to end the uncomfortable interview? The green-shaded lamp\nburnt in the corner, and illumined books and pens and blotting-paper.\nThe whole aspect of the place started another train of thought and\nstruck her as enviably free; in such a room one could work one could\nhave a life of one s own.\n\n\"I think you re very lucky,\" she observed. \"I envy you, living alone\nand having your own things\" and engaged in this exalted way, which had\nno recognition or engagement-ring, she added in her own mind.\n\nMary s lips parted slightly. She could not conceive in what respects\nKatharine, who spoke sincerely, could envy her.\n\n\"I don t think you ve got any reason to envy me,\" she said.\n\n\"Perhaps one always envies other people,\" Katharine observed vaguely.\n\n\"Well, but you ve got everything that any one can want.\"\n\nKatharine remained silent. She gazed into the fire quietly, and without\na trace of self-consciousness. The hostility which she had divined in\nMary s tone had completely disappeared, and she forgot that she had\nbeen upon the point of going.\n\n\"Well, I suppose I have,\" she said at length. \"And yet I sometimes\nthink \" She paused; she did not know how to express what she meant.\n\n\"It came over me in the Tube the other day,\" she resumed, with a smile;\n\"what is it that makes these people go one way rather than the other?\nIt s not love; it s not reason; I think it must be some idea. Perhaps,\nMary, our affections are the shadow of an idea. Perhaps there isn t any\nsuch thing as affection in itself....\" She spoke half-mockingly, asking\nher question, which she scarcely troubled to frame, not of Mary, or of\nany one in particular.\n\nBut the words seemed to Mary Datchet shallow, supercilious,\ncold-blooded, and cynical all in one. All her natural instincts were\nroused in revolt against them.\n\n\"I m the opposite way of thinking, you see,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes; I know you are,\" Katharine replied, looking at her as if now she\nwere about, perhaps, to explain something very important.\n\nMary could not help feeling the simplicity and good faith that lay\nbehind Katharine s words.\n\n\"I think affection is the only reality,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine, almost sadly. She understood that Mary was\nthinking of Ralph, and she felt it impossible to press her to reveal\nmore of this exalted condition; she could only respect the fact that,\nin some few cases, life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass\non. She rose to her feet accordingly. But Mary exclaimed, with\nunmistakable earnestness, that she must not go; that they met so\nseldom; that she wanted to talk to her so much.... Katharine was\nsurprised at the earnestness with which she spoke. It seemed to her\nthat there could be no indiscretion in mentioning Ralph by name.\n\nSeating herself \"for ten minutes,\" she said: \"By the way, Mr. Denham\ntold me he was going to give up the Bar and live in the country. Has he\ngone? He was beginning to tell me about it, when we were interrupted.\"\n\n\"He thinks of it,\" said Mary briefly. The color at once came to her\nface.\n\n\"It would be a very good plan,\" said Katharine in her decided way.\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, because he would do something worth while; he would write a book.\nMy father always says that he s the most remarkable of the young men\nwho write for him.\"\n\nMary bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with\na poker. Katharine s mention of Ralph had roused within her an almost\nirresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case\nbetween herself and Ralph. She knew, from the tone of her voice, that\nin speaking of Ralph she had no desire to probe Mary s secrets, or to\ninsinuate any of her own. Moreover, she liked Katharine; she trusted\nher; she felt a respect for her. The first step of confidence was\ncomparatively simple; but a further confidence had revealed itself, as\nKatharine spoke, which was not so simple, and yet it impressed itself\nupon her as a necessity; she must tell Katharine what it was clear that\nshe had no conception of she must tell Katharine that Ralph was in love\nwith her.\n\n\"I don t know what he means to do,\" she said hurriedly, seeking time\nagainst the pressure of her own conviction. \"I ve not seen him since\nChristmas.\"\n\nKatharine reflected that this was odd; perhaps, after all, she had\nmisunderstood the position. She was in the habit of assuming, however,\nthat she was rather unobservant of the finer shades of feeling, and she\nnoted her present failure as another proof that she was a practical,\nabstract-minded person, better fitted to deal with figures than with\nthe feelings of men and women. Anyhow, William Rodney would say so.\n\n\"And now \" she said.\n\n\"Oh, please stay!\" Mary exclaimed, putting out her hand to stop her.\nDirectly Katharine moved she felt, inarticulately and violently, that\nshe could not bear to let her go. If Katharine went, her only chance of\nspeaking was lost; her only chance of saying something tremendously\nimportant was lost. Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake\nKatharine s attention, and put flight and further silence beyond her\npower. But although the words came to her lips, her throat closed upon\nthem and drove them back. After all, she considered, why should she\nspeak? Because it is right, her instinct told her; right to expose\noneself without reservations to other human beings. She flinched from\nthe thought. It asked too much of one already stripped bare. Something\nshe must keep of her own. But if she did keep something of her own?\nImmediately she figured an immured life, continuing for an immense\nperiod, the same feelings living for ever, neither dwindling nor\nchanging within the ring of a thick stone wall. The imagination of this\nloneliness frightened her, and yet to speak to lose her loneliness, for\nit had already become dear to her, was beyond her power.\n\nHer hand went down to the hem of Katharine s skirt, and, fingering a\nline of fur, she bent her head as if to examine it.\n\n\"I like this fur,\" she said, \"I like your clothes. And you mustn t\nthink that I m going to marry Ralph,\" she continued, in the same tone,\n\"because he doesn t care for me at all. He cares for some one else.\"\nHer head remained bent, and her hand still rested upon the skirt.\n\n\"It s a shabby old dress,\" said Katharine, and the only sign that\nMary s words had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk.\n\n\"You don t mind my telling you that?\" said Mary, raising herself.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Katharine; \"but you re mistaken, aren t you?\" She was,\nin truth, horribly uncomfortable, dismayed, indeed, disillusioned. She\ndisliked the turn things had taken quite intensely. The indecency of it\nafflicted her. The suffering implied by the tone appalled her. She\nlooked at Mary furtively, with eyes that were full of apprehension. But\nif she had hoped to find that these words had been spoken without\nunderstanding of their meaning, she was at once disappointed. Mary lay\nback in her chair, frowning slightly, and looking, Katharine thought,\nas if she had lived fifteen years or so in the space of a few minutes.\n\n\"There are some things, don t you think, that one can t be mistaken\nabout?\" Mary said, quietly and almost coldly. \"That is what puzzles me\nabout this question of being in love. I ve always prided myself upon\nbeing reasonable,\" she added. \"I didn t think I could have felt this I\nmean if the other person didn t. I was foolish. I let myself pretend.\"\nHere she paused. \"For, you see, Katharine,\" she proceeded, rousing\nherself and speaking with greater energy, \"I AM in love. There s no\ndoubt about that.... I m tremendously in love... with Ralph.\" The\nlittle forward shake of her head, which shook a lock of hair, together\nwith her brighter color, gave her an appearance at once proud and\ndefiant.\n\nKatharine thought to herself, \"That s how it feels then.\" She\nhesitated, with a feeling that it was not for her to speak; and then\nsaid, in a low tone, \"You ve got that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary; \"I ve got that. One wouldn t _not_ be in love.... But\nI didn t mean to talk about that; I only wanted you to know. There s\nanother thing I want to tell you...\" She paused. \"I haven t any\nauthority from Ralph to say it; but I m sure of this he s in love with\nyou.\"\n\nKatharine looked at her again, as if her first glance must have been\ndeluded, for, surely, there must be some outward sign that Mary was\ntalking in an excited, or bewildered, or fantastic manner. No; she\nstill frowned, as if she sought her way through the clauses of a\ndifficult argument, but she still looked more like one who reasons than\none who feels.\n\n\"That proves that you re mistaken utterly mistaken,\" said Katharine,\nspeaking reasonably, too. She had no need to verify the mistake by a\nglance at her own recollections, when the fact was so clearly stamped\nupon her mind that if Ralph had any feeling towards her it was one of\ncritical hostility. She did not give the matter another thought, and\nMary, now that she had stated the fact, did not seek to prove it, but\ntried to explain to herself, rather than to Katharine, her motives in\nmaking the statement.\n\nShe had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct\ndemanded her doing; she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond\nher reckoning.\n\n\"I ve told you,\" she said, \"because I want you to help me. I don t want\nto be jealous of you. And I am I m fearfully jealous. The only way, I\nthought, was to tell you.\"\n\nShe hesitated, and groped in her endeavor to make her feelings clear to\nherself.\n\n\"If I tell you, then we can talk; and when I m jealous, I can tell you.\nAnd if I m tempted to do something frightfully mean, I can tell you;\nyou could make me tell you. I find talking so difficult; but loneliness\nfrightens me. I should shut it up in my mind. Yes, that s what I m\nafraid of. Going about with something in my mind all my life that never\nchanges. I find it so difficult to change. When I think a thing s wrong\nI never stop thinking it wrong, and Ralph was quite right, I see, when\nhe said that there s no such thing as right and wrong; no such thing, I\nmean, as judging people \"\n\n\"Ralph Denham said that?\" said Katharine, with considerable\nindignation. In order to have produced such suffering in Mary, it\nseemed to her that he must have behaved with extreme callousness. It\nseemed to her that he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his\nconvenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made\nhis conduct all the worse. She was going on to express herself thus,\nhad not Mary at once interrupted her.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said; \"you don t understand. If there s any fault it s\nmine entirely; after all, if one chooses to run risks \"\n\nHer voice faltered into silence. It was borne in upon her how\ncompletely in running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so\nentirely that she had no longer the right, in talking of Ralph, to\npresume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge. She\nno longer completely possessed her love, since his share in it was\ndoubtful; and now, to make things yet more bitter, her clear vision of\nthe way to face life was rendered tremulous and uncertain, because\nanother was witness of it. Feeling her desire for the old unshared\nintimacy too great to be borne without tears, she rose, walked to the\nfarther end of the room, held the curtains apart, and stood there\nmastered for a moment. The grief itself was not ignoble; the sting of\nit lay in the fact that she had been led to this act of treachery\nagainst herself. Trapped, cheated, robbed, first by Ralph and then by\nKatharine, she seemed all dissolved in humiliation, and bereft of\nanything she could call her own. Tears of weakness welled up and rolled\ndown her cheeks. But tears, at least, she could control, and would this\ninstant, and then, turning, she would face Katharine, and retrieve what\ncould be retrieved of the collapse of her courage.\n\nShe turned. Katharine had not moved; she was leaning a little forward\nin her chair and looking into the fire. Something in the attitude\nreminded Mary of Ralph. So he would sit, leaning forward, looking\nrather fixedly in front of him, while his mind went far away,\nexploring, speculating, until he broke off with his, \"Well, Mary?\" and\nthe silence, that had been so full of romance to her, gave way to the\nmost delightful talk that she had ever known.\n\nSomething unfamiliar in the pose of the silent figure, something still,\nsolemn, significant about it, made her hold her breath. She paused. Her\nthoughts were without bitterness. She was surprised by her own quiet\nand confidence. She came back silently, and sat once more by\nKatharine s side. Mary had no wish to speak. In the silence she seemed\nto have lost her isolation; she was at once the sufferer and the\npitiful spectator of suffering; she was happier than she had ever been;\nshe was more bereft; she was rejected, and she was immensely beloved.\nAttempt to express these sensations was vain, and, moreover, she could\nnot help believing that, without any words on her side, they were\nshared. Thus for some time longer they sat silent, side by side, while\nMary fingered the fur on the skirt of the old dress.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXII\n\n\nThe fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with William\nwas not the only reason which sent Katharine almost at racing speed\nalong the Strand in the direction of his rooms. Punctuality might have\nbeen achieved by taking a cab, had she not wished the open air to fan\ninto flame the glow kindled by Mary s words. For among all the\nimpressions of the evening s talk one was of the nature of a revelation\nand subdued the rest to insignificance. Thus one looked; thus one\nspoke; such was love.\n\n\"She sat up straight and looked at me, and then she said,  I m in\nlove, \" Katharine mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion. It\nwas a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity\noccurred to her; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark; by its\nlight Katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the\nmediocrity, indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own\nfeelings so far as they pretended to correspond with Mary s feelings.\nShe made up her mind to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained,\nand cast her mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath, when\nshe had yielded, heaven knows why, for reasons which seemed now\nimperceptible. So in broad daylight one might revisit the place where\none has groped and turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog.\n\n\"It s all so simple,\" she said to herself. \"There can t be any doubt.\nI ve only got to speak now. I ve only got to speak,\" she went on\nsaying, in time to her own footsteps, and completely forgot Mary\nDatchet.\n\nWilliam Rodney, having come back earlier from the office than he\nexpected, sat down to pick out the melodies in \"The Magic Flute\" upon\nthe piano. Katharine was late, but that was nothing new, and, as she\nhad no particular liking for music, and he felt in the mood for it,\nperhaps it was as well. This defect in Katharine was the more strange,\nWilliam reflected, because, as a rule, the women of her family were\nunusually musical. Her cousin, Cassandra Otway, for example, had a very\nfine taste in music, and he had charming recollections of her in a\nlight fantastic attitude, playing the flute in the morning-room at\nStogdon House. He recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her\nnose, long like all the Otway noses, seemed to extend itself into the\nflute, as if she were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole.\nThe little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical\ntemperament. The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished\nupbringing appealed to William, and suggested a thousand ways in which,\nwith his training and accomplishments, he could be of service to her.\nShe ought to be given the chance of hearing good music, as it is played\nby those who have inherited the great tradition. Moreover, from one or\ntwo remarks let fall in the course of conversation, he thought it\npossible that she had what Katharine professed to lack, a passionate,\nif untaught, appreciation of literature. He had lent her his play.\nMeanwhile, as Katharine was certain to be late, and \"The Magic Flute\"\nis nothing without a voice, he felt inclined to spend the time of\nwaiting in writing a letter to Cassandra, exhorting her to read Pope in\npreference to Dostoevsky, until her feeling for form was more highly\ndeveloped. He set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a\nshape which was light and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause\nwhich he had near at heart, when he heard Katharine upon the stairs. A\nmoment later it was plain that he had been mistaken, it was not\nKatharine; but he could not settle himself to his letter. His temper\nhad changed from one of urbane contentment indeed of delicious\nexpansion to one of uneasiness and expectation. The dinner was brought\nin, and had to be set by the fire to keep hot. It was now a quarter of\nan hour beyond the specified time. He bethought him of a piece of news\nwhich had depressed him in the earlier part of the day. Owing to the\nillness of one of his fellow-clerks, it was likely that he would get no\nholiday until later in the year, which would mean the postponement of\ntheir marriage. But this possibility, after all, was not so\ndisagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every\ntick of the clock that Katharine had completely forgotten her\nengagement. Such things had happened less frequently since Christmas,\nbut what if they were going to begin to happen again? What if their\nmarriage should turn out, as she had said, a farce? He acquitted her of\nany wish to hurt him wantonly, but there was something in her character\nwhich made it impossible for her to help hurting people. Was she cold?\nWas she self-absorbed? He tried to fit her with each of these\ndescriptions, but he had to own that she puzzled him.\n\n\"There are so many things that she doesn t understand,\" he reflected,\nglancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside.\nWhat prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much\nenjoyed beginning? The reason was that Katharine might, at any moment,\nenter the room. The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him\nacutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open\nfor her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that\nhe had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize. Possibly, but\nnot by any means certainly, this would annoy her and as he reached the\ndoubtful comfort of this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and\nKatharine came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no\napology for being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him\nstrangely; but he was determined that this should not weaken his\nresolution to make some kind of stand against her; to get at the truth\nabout her. He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied\nhimself with the plates.\n\n\"I ve got a piece of news for you, Katharine,\" he said directly they\nsat down to table; \"I shan t get my holiday in April. We shall have to\nput off our marriage.\"\n\nHe rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness. Katharine\nstarted a little, as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts.\n\n\"That won t make any difference, will it? I mean the lease isn t\nsigned,\" she replied. \"But why? What has happened?\"\n\nHe told her, in an off-hand way, how one of his fellow-clerks had\nbroken down, and might have to be away for months, six months even, in\nwhich case they would have to think over their position. He said it in\na way which struck her, at last, as oddly casual. She looked at him.\nThere was no outward sign that he was annoyed with her. Was she well\ndressed? She thought sufficiently so. Perhaps she was late? She looked\nfor a clock.\n\n\"It s a good thing we didn t take the house then,\" she repeated\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"It ll mean, too, I m afraid, that I shan t be as free for a\nconsiderable time as I have been,\" he continued. She had time to\nreflect that she gained something by all this, though it was too soon\nto determine what. But the light which had been burning with such\nintensity as she came along was suddenly overclouded, as much by his\nmanner as by his news. She had been prepared to meet opposition, which\nis simple to encounter compared with she did not know what it was that\nshe had to encounter. The meal passed in quiet, well-controlled talk\nabout indifferent things. Music was not a subject about which she knew\nanything, but she liked him to tell her things; and could, she mused,\nas he talked, fancy the evenings of married life spent thus, over the\nfire; spent thus, or with a book, perhaps, for then she would have time\nto read her books, and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused\nmind what she longed to know. The atmosphere was very free. Suddenly\nWilliam broke off. She looked up apprehensively, brushing aside these\nthoughts with annoyance.\n\n\"Where should I address a letter to Cassandra?\" he asked her. It was\nobvious again that William had some meaning or other to-night, or was\nin some mood. \"We ve struck up a friendship,\" he added.\n\n\"She s at home, I think,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"They keep her too much at home,\" said William. \"Why don t you ask her\nto stay with you, and let her hear a little good music? I ll just\nfinish what I was saying, if you don t mind, because I m particularly\nanxious that she should hear to-morrow.\"\n\nKatharine sank back in her chair, and Rodney took the paper on his\nknees, and went on with his sentence. \"Style, you know, is what we tend\nto neglect \"; but he was far more conscious of Katharine s eye upon him\nthan of what he was saying about style. He knew that she was looking at\nhim, but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess.\n\nIn truth, she had fallen sufficiently into his trap to feel\nuncomfortably roused and disturbed and unable to proceed on the lines\nlaid down for herself. This indifferent, if not hostile, attitude on\nWilliam s part made it impossible to break off without animosity,\nlargely and completely. Infinitely preferable was Mary s state, she\nthought, where there was a simple thing to do and one did it. In fact,\nshe could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had a part\nin all the refinements, reserves, and subtleties of feeling for which\nher friends and family were so distinguished. For example, although she\nliked Cassandra well enough, her fantastic method of life struck her as\npurely frivolous; now it was socialism, now it was silkworms, now it\nwas music which last she supposed was the cause of William s sudden\ninterest in her. Never before had William wasted the minutes of her\npresence in writing his letters. With a curious sense of light opening\nwhere all, hitherto, had been opaque, it dawned upon her that, after\nall, possibly, yes, probably, nay, certainly, the devotion which she\nhad almost wearily taken for granted existed in a much slighter degree\nthan she had suspected, or existed no longer. She looked at him\nattentively as if this discovery of hers must show traces in his face.\nNever had she seen so much to respect in his appearance, so much that\nattracted her by its sensitiveness and intelligence, although she saw\nthese qualities as if they were those one responds to, dumbly, in the\nface of a stranger. The head bent over the paper, thoughtful as usual,\nhad now a composure which seemed somehow to place it at a distance,\nlike a face seen talking to some one else behind glass.\n\nHe wrote on, without raising his eyes. She would have spoken, but could\nnot bring herself to ask him for signs of affection which she had no\nright to claim. The conviction that he was thus strange to her filled\nher with despondency, and illustrated quite beyond doubt the infinite\nloneliness of human beings. She had never felt the truth of this so\nstrongly before. She looked away into the fire; it seemed to her that\neven physically they were now scarcely within speaking distance; and\nspiritually there was certainly no human being with whom she could\nclaim comradeship; no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be\nsatisfied; nothing remained in whose reality she could believe, save\nthose abstract ideas figures, laws, stars, facts, which she could\nhardly hold to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame.\n\nWhen Rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence, and\nthe meanness of such devices, and looked up ready to seek some excuse\nfor a good laugh, or opening for a confession, he was disconcerted by\nwhat he saw. Katharine seemed equally oblivious of what was bad or of\nwhat was good in him. Her expression suggested concentration upon\nsomething entirely remote from her surroundings. The carelessness of\nher attitude seemed to him rather masculine than feminine. His impulse\nto break up the constraint was chilled, and once more the exasperating\nsense of his own impotency returned to him. He could not help\ncontrasting Katharine with his vision of the engaging, whimsical\nCassandra; Katharine undemonstrative, inconsiderate, silent, and yet so\nnotable that he could never do without her good opinion.\n\nShe veered round upon him a moment later, as if, when her train of\nthought was ended, she became aware of his presence.\n\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" she asked. He thought he heard faint\namusement in her tone, but not a trace of jealousy.\n\n\"No, I m not going to write any more to-night,\" he said. \"I m not in\nthe mood for it for some reason. I can t say what I want to say.\"\n\n\"Cassandra won t know if it s well written or badly written,\" Katharine\nremarked.\n\n\"I m not so sure about that. I should say she has a good deal of\nliterary feeling.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Katharine indifferently. \"You ve been neglecting my\neducation lately, by the way. I wish you d read something. Let me\nchoose a book.\" So speaking, she went across to his bookshelves and\nbegan looking in a desultory way among his books. Anything, she\nthought, was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove\nhome to her the distance between them. As she pulled one book forward\nand then another she thought ironically of her own certainty not an\nhour ago; how it had vanished in a moment, how she was merely marking\ntime as best she could, not knowing in the least where they stood, what\nthey felt, or whether William loved her or not. More and more the\ncondition of Mary s mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable if,\nindeed, it could be quite as she figured it if, indeed, simplicity\nexisted for any one of the daughters of women.\n\n\"Swift,\" she said, at last, taking out a volume at haphazard to settle\nthis question at least. \"Let us have some Swift.\"\n\nRodney took the book, held it in front of him, inserted one finger\nbetween the pages, but said nothing. His face wore a queer expression\nof deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and\nwould not say anything until his mind were made up.\n\nKatharine, taking her chair beside him, noted his silence and looked at\nhim with sudden apprehension. What she hoped or feared, she could not\nhave said; a most irrational and indefensible desire for some assurance\nof his affection was, perhaps, uppermost in her mind. Peevishness,\ncomplaints, exacting cross-examination she was used to, but this\nattitude of composed quiet, which seemed to come from the consciousness\nof power within, puzzled her. She did not know what was going to happen\nnext.\n\nAt last William spoke.\n\n\"I think it s a little odd, don t you?\" he said, in a voice of detached\nreflection. \"Most people, I mean, would be seriously upset if their\nmarriage was put off for six months or so. But we aren t; now how do\nyou account for that?\"\n\nShe looked at him and observed his judicial attitude as of one holding\nfar aloof from emotion.\n\n\"I attribute it,\" he went on, without waiting for her to answer, \"to\nthe fact that neither of us is in the least romantic about the other.\nThat may be partly, no doubt, because we ve known each other so long;\nbut I m inclined to think there s more in it than that. There s\nsomething temperamental. I think you re a trifle cold, and I suspect\nI m a trifle self-absorbed. If that were so it goes a long way to\nexplaining our odd lack of illusion about each other. I m not saying\nthat the most satisfactory marriages aren t founded upon this sort of\nunderstanding. But certainly it struck me as odd this morning, when\nWilson told me, how little upset I felt. By the way, you re sure we\nhaven t committed ourselves to that house?\"\n\n\"I ve kept the letters, and I ll go through them to-morrow; but I m\ncertain we re on the safe side.\"\n\n\"Thanks. As to the psychological problem,\" he continued, as if the\nquestion interested him in a detached way, \"there s no doubt, I think,\nthat either of us is capable of feeling what, for reasons of\nsimplicity, I call romance for a third person at least, I ve little\ndoubt in my own case.\"\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first time in all her knowledge of him that\nKatharine had known William enter thus deliberately and without sign of\nemotion upon a statement of his own feelings. He was wont to discourage\nsuch intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn of the\nconversation, as much as to say that men, or men of the world, find\nsuch topics a little silly, or in doubtful taste. His obvious wish to\nexplain something puzzled her, interested her, and neutralized the\nwound to her vanity. For some reason, too, she felt more at ease with\nhim than usual; or her ease was more the ease of equality she could not\nstop to think of that at the moment though. His remarks interested her\ntoo much for the light that they threw upon certain problems of her\nown.\n\n\"What is this romance?\" she mused.\n\n\"Ah, that s the question. I ve never come across a definition that\nsatisfied me, though there are some very good ones\" he glanced in the\ndirection of his books.\n\n\"It s not altogether knowing the other person, perhaps it s ignorance,\"\nshe hazarded.\n\n\"Some authorities say it s a question of distance romance in\nliterature, that is \"\n\n\"Possibly, in the case of art. But in the case of people it may be \"\nshe hesitated.\n\n\"Have you no personal experience of it?\" he asked, letting his eyes\nrest upon her swiftly for a moment.\n\n\"I believe it s influenced me enormously,\" she said, in the tone of one\nabsorbed by the possibilities of some view just presented to them; \"but\nin my life there s so little scope for it,\" she added. She reviewed her\ndaily task, the perpetual demands upon her for good sense,\nself-control, and accuracy in a house containing a romantic mother. Ah,\nbut her romance wasn t _that_ romance. It was a desire, an echo, a\nsound; she could drape it in color, see it in form, hear it in music,\nbut not in words; no, never in words. She sighed, teased by desires so\nincoherent, so incommunicable.\n\n\"But isn t it curious,\" William resumed, \"that you should neither feel\nit for me, nor I for you?\"\n\nKatharine agreed that it was curious very; but even more curious to her\nwas the fact that she was discussing the question with William. It\nrevealed possibilities which opened a prospect of a new relationship\naltogether. Somehow it seemed to her that he was helping her to\nunderstand what she had never understood; and in her gratitude she was\nconscious of a most sisterly desire to help him, too sisterly, save for\none pang, not quite to be subdued, that for him she was without\nromance.\n\n\"I think you might be very happy with some one you loved in that way,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"You assume that romance survives a closer knowledge of the person one\nloves?\"\n\nHe asked the question formally, to protect himself from the sort of\npersonality which he dreaded. The whole situation needed the most\ncareful management lest it should degenerate into some degrading and\ndisturbing exhibition such as the scene, which he could never think of\nwithout shame, upon the heath among the dead leaves. And yet each\nsentence brought him relief. He was coming to understand something or\nother about his own desires hitherto undefined by him, the source of\nhis difficulty with Katharine. The wish to hurt her, which had urged\nhim to begin, had completely left him, and he felt that it was only\nKatharine now who could help him to be sure. He must take his time.\nThere were so many things that he could not say without the greatest\ndifficulty that name, for example, Cassandra. Nor could he move his\neyes from a certain spot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in\nthe heart of the coals. He waited in suspense for Katharine to\ncontinue. She had said that he might be very happy with some one he\nloved in that way.\n\n\"I don t see why it shouldn t last with you,\" she resumed. \"I can\nimagine a certain sort of person \" she paused; she was aware that he\nwas listening with the greatest intentness, and that his formality was\nmerely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort. There was some\nperson then some woman who could it be? Cassandra? Ah, possibly \n\n\"A person,\" she added, speaking in the most matter-of-fact tone she\ncould command, \"like Cassandra Otway, for instance. Cassandra is the\nmost interesting of the Otways with the exception of Henry. Even so, I\nlike Cassandra better. She has more than mere cleverness. She is a\ncharacter a person by herself.\"\n\n\"Those dreadful insects!\" burst from William, with a nervous laugh, and\na little spasm went through him as Katharine noticed. It _was_\nCassandra then. Automatically and dully she replied, \"You could insist\nthat she confined herself to to something else.... But she cares for\nmusic; I believe she writes poetry; and there can be no doubt that she\nhas a peculiar charm \"\n\nShe ceased, as if defining to herself this peculiar charm. After a\nmoment s silence William jerked out:\n\n\"I thought her affectionate?\"\n\n\"Extremely affectionate. She worships Henry. When you think what a\nhouse that is Uncle Francis always in one mood or another \"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear,\" William muttered.\n\n\"And you have so much in common.\"\n\n\"My dear Katharine!\" William exclaimed, flinging himself back in his\nchair, and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire. \"I really\ndon t know what we re talking about.... I assure you....\"\n\nHe was covered with an extreme confusion.\n\nHe withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages of\nGulliver, opened the book, and ran his eye down the list of chapters,\nas though he were about to select the one most suitable for reading\naloud. As Katharine watched him, she was seized with preliminary\nsymptoms of his own panic. At the same time she was convinced that,\nshould he find the right page, take out his spectacles, clear his\nthroat, and open his lips, a chance that would never come again in all\ntheir lives would be lost to them both.\n\n\"We re talking about things that interest us both very much,\" she said.\n\"Shan t we go on talking, and leave Swift for another time? I don t\nfeel in the mood for Swift, and it s a pity to read any one when that s\nthe case particularly Swift.\"\n\nThe presence of wise literary speculation, as she calculated, restored\nWilliam s confidence in his security, and he replaced the book in the\nbookcase, keeping his back turned to her as he did so, and taking\nadvantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together.\n\nBut a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing him\nthat his mind, when looked at from within, was no longer familiar\nground. He felt, that is to say, what he had never consciously felt\nbefore; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wont to think\nhim; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous possibilities.\nHe paced once up and down the room, and then flung himself impetuously\ninto the chair by Katharine s side. He had never felt anything like\nthis before; he put himself entirely into her hands; he cast off all\nresponsibility. He very nearly exclaimed aloud:\n\n\"You ve stirred up all these odious and violent emotions, and now you\nmust do the best you can with them.\"\n\nHer near presence, however, had a calming and reassuring effect upon\nhis agitation, and he was conscious only of an implicit trust that,\nsomehow, he was safe with her, that she would see him through, find out\nwhat it was that he wanted, and procure it for him.\n\n\"I wish to do whatever you tell me to do,\" he said. \"I put myself\nentirely in your hands, Katharine.\"\n\n\"You must try to tell me what you feel,\" she said.\n\n\"My dear, I feel a thousand things every second. I don t know, I m\nsure, what I feel. That afternoon on the heath it was then then \" He\nbroke off; he did not tell her what had happened then. \"Your ghastly\ngood sense, as usual, has convinced me for the moment but what the\ntruth is, Heaven only knows!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Isn t it the truth that you are, or might be, in love with Cassandra?\"\nshe said gently.\n\nWilliam bowed his head. After a moment s silence he murmured:\n\n\"I believe you re right, Katharine.\"\n\nShe sighed, involuntarily. She had been hoping all this time, with an\nintensity that increased second by second against the current of her\nwords, that it would not in the end come to this. After a moment of\nsurprising anguish, she summoned her courage to tell him how she wished\nonly that she might help him, and had framed the first words of her\nspeech when a knock, terrific and startling to people in their\noverwrought condition, sounded upon the door.\n\n\"Katharine, I worship you,\" he urged, half in a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, withdrawing with a little shiver, \"but you must\nopen the door.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIII\n\n\nWhen Ralph Denham entered the room and saw Katharine seated with her\nback to him, he was conscious of a change in the grade of the\natmosphere such as a traveler meets with sometimes upon the roads,\nparticularly after sunset, when, without warning, he runs from clammy\nchill to a hoard of unspent warmth in which the sweetness of hay and\nbeanfield is cherished, as if the sun still shone although the moon is\nup. He hesitated; he shuddered; he walked elaborately to the window and\nlaid aside his coat. He balanced his stick most carefully against the\nfolds of the curtain. Thus occupied with his own sensations and\npreparations, he had little time to observe what either of the other\ntwo was feeling. Such symptoms of agitation as he might perceive (and\nthey had left their tokens in brightness of eye and pallor of cheeks)\nseemed to him well befitting the actors in so great a drama as that of\nKatharine Hilbery s daily life. Beauty and passion were the breath of\nher being, he thought.\n\nShe scarcely noticed his presence, or only as it forced her to adopt a\nmanner of composure, which she was certainly far from feeling. William,\nhowever, was even more agitated than she was, and her first instalment\nof promised help took the form of some commonplace upon the age of the\nbuilding or the architect s name, which gave him an excuse to fumble in\na drawer for certain designs, which he laid upon the table between the\nthree of them.\n\nWhich of the three followed the designs most carefully it would be\ndifficult to tell, but it is certain that not one of the three found\nfor the moment anything to say. Years of training in a drawing-room\ncame at length to Katharine s help, and she said something suitable, at\nthe same moment withdrawing her hand from the table because she\nperceived that it trembled. William agreed effusively; Denham\ncorroborated him, speaking in rather high-pitched tones; they thrust\naside the plans, and drew nearer to the fireplace.\n\n\"I d rather live here than anywhere in the whole of London,\" said\nDenham.\n\n(\"And I ve got nowhere to live\") Katharine thought, as she agreed\naloud.\n\n\"You could get rooms here, no doubt, if you wanted to,\" Rodney replied.\n\n\"But I m just leaving London for good I ve taken that cottage I was\ntelling you about.\" The announcement seemed to convey very little to\neither of his hearers.\n\n\"Indeed? that s sad.... You must give me your address. But you won t\ncut yourself off altogether, surely \"\n\n\"You ll be moving, too, I suppose,\" Denham remarked.\n\nWilliam showed such visible signs of floundering that Katharine\ncollected herself and asked:\n\n\"Where is the cottage you ve taken?\"\n\nIn answering her, Denham turned and looked at her. As their eyes met,\nshe realized for the first time that she was talking to Ralph Denham,\nand she remembered, without recalling any details, that she had been\nspeaking of him quite lately, and that she had reason to think ill of\nhim. What Mary had said she could not remember, but she felt that there\nwas a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time to\nexamine knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf. But her\nagitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past. She must get\nthrough the matter in hand, and then think it out in quiet. She bent\nher mind to follow what Ralph was saying. He was telling her that he\nhad taken a cottage in Norfolk, and she was saying that she knew, or\ndid not know, that particular neighborhood. But after a moment s\nattention her mind flew to Rodney, and she had an unusual, indeed\nunprecedented, sense that they were in touch and shared each other s\nthoughts. If only Ralph were not there, she would at once give way to\nher desire to take William s hand, then to bend his head upon her\nshoulder, for this was what she wanted to do more than anything at the\nmoment, unless, indeed, she wished more than anything to be alone yes,\nthat was what she wanted. She was sick to death of these discussions;\nshe shivered at the effort to reveal her feelings. She had forgotten to\nanswer. William was speaking now.\n\n\"But what will you find to do in the country?\" she asked at random,\nstriking into a conversation which she had only half heard, in such a\nway as to make both Rodney and Denham look at her with a little\nsurprise. But directly she took up the conversation, it was William s\nturn to fall silent. He at once forgot to listen to what they were\nsaying, although he interposed nervously at intervals, \"Yes, yes, yes.\"\nAs the minutes passed, Ralph s presence became more and more\nintolerable to him, since there was so much that he must say to\nKatharine; the moment he could not talk to her, terrible doubts,\nunanswerable questions accumulated, which he must lay before Katharine,\nfor she alone could help him now. Unless he could see her alone, it\nwould be impossible for him ever to sleep, or to know what he had said\nin a moment of madness, which was not altogether mad, or was it mad? He\nnodded his head, and said, nervously, \"Yes, yes,\" and looked at\nKatharine, and thought how beautiful she looked; there was no one in\nthe world that he admired more. There was an emotion in her face which\nlent it an expression he had never seen there. Then, as he was turning\nover means by which he could speak to her alone, she rose, and he was\ntaken by surprise, for he had counted on the fact that she would\noutstay Denham. His only chance, then, of saying something to her in\nprivate, was to take her downstairs and walk with her to the street.\nWhile he hesitated, however, overcome with the difficulty of putting\none simple thought into words when all his thoughts were scattered\nabout, and all were too strong for utterance, he was struck silent by\nsomething that was still more unexpected. Denham got up from his chair,\nlooked at Katharine, and said:\n\n\"I m going, too. Shall we go together?\"\n\nAnd before William could see any way of detaining him or would it be\nbetter to detain Katharine? he had taken his hat, stick, and was\nholding the door open for Katharine to pass out. The most that William\ncould do was to stand at the head of the stairs and say good-night. He\ncould not offer to go with them. He could not insist that she should\nstay. He watched her descend, rather slowly, owing to the dusk of the\nstaircase, and he had a last sight of Denham s head and of Katharine s\nhead near together, against the panels, when suddenly a pang of acute\njealousy overcame him, and had he not remained conscious of the\nslippers upon his feet, he would have run after them or cried out. As\nit was he could not move from the spot. At the turn of the staircase\nKatharine turned to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal\ntheir compact of good friendship. Instead of returning her silent\ngreeting, William grinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of\nrage.\n\nShe stopped dead for a moment, and then descended slowly into the\ncourt. She looked to the right and to the left, and once up into the\nsky. She was only conscious of Denham as a block upon her thoughts. She\nmeasured the distance that must be traversed before she would be alone.\nBut when they came to the Strand no cabs were to be seen, and Denham\nbroke the silence by saying:\n\n\"There seem to be no cabs. Shall we walk on a little?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she agreed, paying no attention to him.\n\nAware of her preoccupation, or absorbed in his own thoughts, Ralph said\nnothing further; and in silence they walked some distance along the\nStrand. Ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order\nthat one came before the rest, and the determination that when he spoke\nhe should speak worthily, made him put off the moment of speaking till\nhe had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him.\nThe Strand was too busy. There was too much risk, also, of finding an\nempty cab. Without a word of explanation he turned to the left, down\none of the side streets leading to the river. On no account must they\npart until something of the very greatest importance had happened. He\nknew perfectly well what he wished to say, and had arranged not only\nthe substance, but the order in which he was to say it. Now, however,\nthat he was alone with her, not only did he find the difficulty of\nspeaking almost insurmountable, but he was aware that he was angry with\nher for thus disturbing him, and casting, as it was so easy for a\nperson of her advantages to do, these phantoms and pitfalls across his\npath. He was determined that he would question her as severely as he\nwould question himself; and make them both, once and for all, either\njustify her dominance or renounce it. But the longer they walked thus\nalone, the more he was disturbed by the sense of her actual presence.\nHer skirt blew; the feathers in her hat waved; sometimes he saw her a\nstep or two ahead of him, or had to wait for her to catch him up.\n\nThe silence was prolonged, and at length drew her attention to him.\nFirst she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from his\ncompany; then she recalled vaguely something that Mary had said to make\nher think ill of him; she could not remember what, but the\nrecollection, combined with his masterful ways why did he walk so fast\ndown this side street? made her more and more conscious of a person of\nmarked, though disagreeable, force by her side. She stopped and,\nlooking round her for a cab, sighted one in the distance. He was thus\nprecipitated into speech.\n\n\"Should you mind if we walked a little farther?\" he asked. \"There s\nsomething I want to say to you.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she replied, guessing that his request had something to do\nwith Mary Datchet.\n\n\"It s quieter by the river,\" he said, and instantly he crossed over. \"I\nwant to ask you merely this,\" he began. But he paused so long that she\ncould see his head against the sky; the slope of his thin cheek and his\nlarge, strong nose were clearly marked against it. While he paused,\nwords that were quite different from those he intended to use presented\nthemselves.\n\n\"I ve made you my standard ever since I saw you. I ve dreamt about you;\nI ve thought of nothing but you; you represent to me the only reality\nin the world.\"\n\nHis words, and the queer strained voice in which he spoke them, made it\nappear as if he addressed some person who was not the woman beside him,\nbut some one far away.\n\n\"And now things have come to such a pass that, unless I can speak to\nyou openly, I believe I shall go mad. I think of you as the most\nbeautiful, the truest thing in the world,\" he continued, filled with a\nsense of exaltation, and feeling that he had no need now to choose his\nwords with pedantic accuracy, for what he wanted to say was suddenly\nbecome plain to him.\n\n\"I see you everywhere, in the stars, in the river; to me you re\neverything that exists; the reality of everything. Life, I tell you,\nwould be impossible without you. And now I want \"\n\nShe had heard him so far with a feeling that she had dropped some\nmaterial word which made sense of the rest. She could hear no more of\nthis unintelligible rambling without checking him. She felt that she\nwas overhearing what was meant for another.\n\n\"I don t understand,\" she said. \"You re saying things that you don t\nmean.\"\n\n\"I mean every word I say,\" he replied, emphatically. He turned his head\ntowards her. She recovered the words she was searching for while he\nspoke. \"Ralph Denham is in love with you.\" They came back to her in\nMary Datchet s voice. Her anger blazed up in her.\n\n\"I saw Mary Datchet this afternoon,\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe made a movement as if he were surprised or taken aback, but answered\nin a moment:\n\n\"She told you that I had asked her to marry me, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No!\" Katharine exclaimed, in surprise.\n\n\"I did though. It was the day I saw you at Lincoln,\" he continued. \"I\nhad meant to ask her to marry me, and then I looked out of the window\nand saw you. After that I didn t want to ask any one to marry me. But I\ndid it; and she knew I was lying, and refused me. I thought then, and\nstill think, that she cares for me. I behaved very badly. I don t\ndefend myself.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Katharine, \"I should hope not. There s no defence that I can\nthink of. If any conduct is wrong, that is.\" She spoke with an energy\nthat was directed even more against herself than against him. \"It seems\nto me,\" she continued, with the same energy, \"that people are bound to\nbe honest. There s no excuse for such behavior.\" She could now see\nplainly before her eyes the expression on Mary Datchet s face.\n\nAfter a short pause, he said:\n\n\"I am not telling you that I am in love with you. I am not in love with\nyou.\"\n\n\"I didn t think that,\" she replied, conscious of some bewilderment.\n\n\"I have not spoken a word to you that I do not mean,\" he added.\n\n\"Tell me then what it is that you mean,\" she said at length.\n\nAs if obeying a common instinct, they both stopped and, bending\nslightly over the balustrade of the river, looked into the flowing\nwater.\n\n\"You say that we ve got to be honest,\" Ralph began. \"Very well. I will\ntry to tell you the facts; but I warn you, you ll think me mad. It s a\nfact, though, that since I first saw you four or five months ago I have\nmade you, in an utterly absurd way, I expect, my ideal. I m almost\nashamed to tell you what lengths I ve gone to. It s become the thing\nthat matters most in my life.\" He checked himself. \"Without knowing\nyou, except that you re beautiful, and all that, I ve come to believe\nthat we re in some sort of agreement; that we re after something\ntogether; that we see something.... I ve got into the habit of\nimagining you; I m always thinking what you d say or do; I walk along\nthe street talking to you; I dream of you. It s merely a bad habit, a\nschoolboy habit, day-dreaming; it s a common experience; half one s\nfriends do the same; well, those are the facts.\"\n\nSimultaneously, they both walked on very slowly.\n\n\"If you were to know me you would feel none of this,\" she said. \"We\ndon t know each other we ve always been interrupted.... Were you going\nto tell me this that day my aunts came?\" she asked, recollecting the\nwhole scene.\n\nHe bowed his head.\n\n\"The day you told me of your engagement,\" he said.\n\nShe thought, with a start, that she was no longer engaged.\n\n\"I deny that I should cease to feel this if I knew you,\" he went on. \"I\nshould feel it more reasonably that s all. I shouldn t talk the kind of\nnonsense I ve talked to-night.... But it wasn t nonsense. It was the\ntruth,\" he said doggedly. \"It s the important thing. You can force me\nto talk as if this feeling for you were an hallucination, but all our\nfeelings are that. The best of them are half illusions. Still,\" he\nadded, as if arguing to himself, \"if it weren t as real a feeling as\nI m capable of, I shouldn t be changing my life on your account.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I told you. I m taking a cottage. I m giving up my profession.\"\n\n\"On my account?\" she asked, in amazement.\n\n\"Yes, on your account,\" he replied. He explained his meaning no\nfurther.\n\n\"But I don t know you or your circumstances,\" she said at last, as he\nremained silent.\n\n\"You have no opinion about me one way or the other?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I have an opinion \" she hesitated.\n\nHe controlled his wish to ask her to explain herself, and much to his\npleasure she went on, appearing to search her mind.\n\n\"I thought that you criticized me perhaps disliked me. I thought of you\nas a person who judges \"\n\n\"No; I m a person who feels,\" he said, in a low voice.\n\n\"Tell me, then, what has made you do this?\" she asked, after a break.\n\nHe told her in an orderly way, betokening careful preparation, all that\nhe had meant to say at first; how he stood with regard to his brothers\nand sisters; what his mother had said, and his sister Joan had\nrefrained from saying; exactly how many pounds stood in his name at the\nbank; what prospect his brother had of earning a livelihood in America;\nhow much of their income went on rent, and other details known to him\nby heart. She listened to all this, so that she could have passed an\nexamination in it by the time Waterloo Bridge was in sight; and yet she\nwas no more listening to it than she was counting the paving-stones at\nher feet. She was feeling happier than she had felt in her life. If\nDenham could have seen how visibly books of algebraic symbols, pages\nall speckled with dots and dashes and twisted bars, came before her\neyes as they trod the Embankment, his secret joy in her attention might\nhave been dispersed. She went on, saying, \"Yes, I see.... But how would\nthat help you?... Your brother has passed his examination?\" so\nsensibly, that he had constantly to keep his brain in check; and all\nthe time she was in fancy looking up through a telescope at white\nshadow-cleft disks which were other worlds, until she felt herself\npossessed of two bodies, one walking by the river with Denham, the\nother concentrated to a silver globe aloft in the fine blue space above\nthe scum of vapors that was covering the visible world. She looked at\nthe sky once, and saw that no star was keen enough to pierce the flight\nof watery clouds now coursing rapidly before the west wind. She looked\ndown hurriedly again. There was no reason, she assured herself, for\nthis feeling of happiness; she was not free; she was not alone; she was\nstill bound to earth by a million fibres; every step took her nearer\nhome. Nevertheless, she exulted as she had never exulted before. The\nair was fresher, the lights more distinct, the cold stone of the\nbalustrade colder and harder, when by chance or purpose she struck her\nhand against it. No feeling of annoyance with Denham remained; he\ncertainly did not hinder any flight she might choose to make, whether\nin the direction of the sky or of her home; but that her condition was\ndue to him, or to anything that he had said, she had no consciousness\nat all.\n\nThey were now within sight of the stream of cabs and omnibuses crossing\nto and from the Surrey side of the river; the sound of the traffic, the\nhooting of motor-horns, and the light chime of tram-bells sounded more\nand more distinctly, and, with the increase of noise, they both became\nsilent. With a common instinct they slackened their pace, as if to\nlengthen the time of semi-privacy allowed them. To Ralph, the pleasure\nof these last yards of the walk with Katharine was so great that he\ncould not look beyond the present moment to the time when she should\nhave left him. He had no wish to use the last moments of their\ncompanionship in adding fresh words to what he had already said. Since\nthey had stopped talking, she had become to him not so much a real\nperson, as the very woman he dreamt of; but his solitary dreams had\nnever produced any such keenness of sensation as that which he felt in\nher presence. He himself was also strangely transfigured. He had\ncomplete mastery of all his faculties. For the first time he was in\npossession of his full powers. The vistas which opened before him\nseemed to have no perceptible end. But the mood had none of the\nrestlessness or feverish desire to add one delight to another which had\nhitherto marked, and somewhat spoilt, the most rapturous of his\nimaginings. It was a mood that took such clear-eyed account of the\nconditions of human life that he was not disturbed in the least by the\ngliding presence of a taxicab, and without agitation he perceived that\nKatharine was conscious of it also, and turned her head in that\ndirection. Their halting steps acknowledged the desirability of\nengaging the cab; and they stopped simultaneously, and signed to it.\n\n\"Then you will let me know your decision as soon as you can?\" he asked,\nwith his hand on the door.\n\nShe hesitated for a moment. She could not immediately recall what the\nquestion was that she had to decide.\n\n\"I will write,\" she said vaguely. \"No,\" she added, in a second,\nbethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided upon a\nquestion to which she had paid no attention, \"I don t see how to manage\nit.\"\n\nShe stood looking at Denham, considering and hesitating, with her foot\nupon the step. He guessed her difficulties; he knew in a second that\nshe had heard nothing; he knew everything that she felt.\n\n\"There s only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that I know\nof,\" he said quickly; \"that s Kew.\"\n\n\"Kew?\"\n\n\"Kew,\" he repeated, with immense decision. He shut the door and gave\nher address to the driver. She instantly was conveyed away from him,\nand her cab joined the knotted stream of vehicles, each marked by a\nlight, and indistinguishable one from the other. He stood watching for\na moment, and then, as if swept by some fierce impulse, from the spot\nwhere they had stood, he turned, crossed the road at a rapid pace, and\ndisappeared.\n\nHe walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural\nexaltation until he reached a narrow street, at this hour empty of\ntraffic and passengers. Here, whether it was the shops with their\nshuttered windows, the smooth and silvered curve of the wood pavement,\nor a natural ebb of feeling, his exaltation slowly oozed and deserted\nhim. He was now conscious of the loss that follows any revelation; he\nhad lost something in speaking to Katharine, for, after all, was the\nKatharine whom he loved the same as the real Katharine? She had\ntranscended her entirely at moments; her skirt had blown, her feather\nwaved, her voice spoken; yes, but how terrible sometimes the pause\nbetween the voice of one s dreams and the voice that comes from the\nobject of one s dreams! He felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the\nfigure cut by human beings when they try to carry out, in practice,\nwhat they have the power to conceive. How small both he and Katharine\nhad appeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped\nthem! He recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which\nthey had tried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over to\nhimself. By repeating Katharine s words, he came in a few moments to\nsuch a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever. But\nshe was engaged to be married, he remembered with a start. The strength\nof his feeling was revealed to him instantly, and he gave himself up to\nan irresistible rage and sense of frustration. The image of Rodney came\nbefore him with every circumstance of folly and indignity. That little\npink-cheeked dancing-master to marry Katharine? that gibbering ass with\nthe face of a monkey on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop?\nwith his tragedies and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides\nand pettinesses? Lord! marry Rodney! She must be as great a fool as he\nwas. His bitterness took possession of him, and as he sat in the corner\nof the underground carriage, he looked as stark an image of\nunapproachable severity as could be imagined. Directly he reached home\nhe sat down at his table, and began to write Katharine a long, wild,\nmad letter, begging her for both their sakes to break with Rodney,\nimploring her not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty, the\none truth, the one hope; not to be a traitor, not to be a deserter, for\nif she were and he wound up with a quiet and brief assertion that,\nwhatever she did or left undone, he would believe to be the best, and\naccept from her with gratitude. He covered sheet after sheet, and heard\nthe early carts starting for London before he went to bed.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIV\n\n\nThe first signs of spring, even such as make themselves felt towards\nthe middle of February, not only produce little white and violet\nflowers in the more sheltered corners of woods and gardens, but bring\nto birth thoughts and desires comparable to those faintly colored and\nsweetly scented petals in the minds of men and women. Lives frozen by\nage, so far as the present is concerned, to a hard surface, which\nneither reflects nor yields, at this season become soft and fluid,\nreflecting the shapes and colors of the present, as well as the shapes\nand colors of the past. In the case of Mrs. Hilbery, these early spring\ndays were chiefly upsetting inasmuch as they caused a general\nquickening of her emotional powers, which, as far as the past was\nconcerned, had never suffered much diminution. But in the spring her\ndesire for expression invariably increased. She was haunted by the\nghosts of phrases. She gave herself up to a sensual delight in the\ncombinations of words. She sought them in the pages of her favorite\nauthors. She made them for herself on scraps of paper, and rolled them\non her tongue when there seemed no occasion for such eloquence. She was\nupheld in these excursions by the certainty that no language could\noutdo the splendor of her father s memory, and although her efforts did\nnot notably further the end of his biography, she was under the\nimpression of living more in his shade at such times than at others. No\none can escape the power of language, let alone those of English birth\nbrought up from childhood, as Mrs. Hilbery had been, to disport\nthemselves now in the Saxon plainness, now in the Latin splendor of the\ntongue, and stored with memories, as she was, of old poets exuberating\nin an infinity of vocables. Even Katharine was slightly affected\nagainst her better judgment by her mother s enthusiasm. Not that her\njudgment could altogether acquiesce in the necessity for a study of\nShakespeare s sonnets as a preliminary to the fifth chapter of her\ngrandfather s biography. Beginning with a perfectly frivolous jest,\nMrs. Hilbery had evolved a theory that Anne Hathaway had a way, among\nother things, of writing Shakespeare s sonnets; the idea, struck out to\nenliven a party of professors, who forwarded a number of privately\nprinted manuals within the next few days for her instruction, had\nsubmerged her in a flood of Elizabethan literature; she had come half\nto believe in her joke, which was, she said, at least as good as other\npeople s facts, and all her fancy for the time being centered upon\nStratford-on-Avon. She had a plan, she told Katharine, when, rather\nlater than usual, Katharine came into the room the morning after her\nwalk by the river, for visiting Shakespeare s tomb. Any fact about the\npoet had become, for the moment, of far greater interest to her than\nthe immediate present, and the certainty that there was existing in\nEngland a spot of ground where Shakespeare had undoubtedly stood, where\nhis very bones lay directly beneath one s feet, was so absorbing to her\non this particular occasion that she greeted her daughter with the\nexclamation:\n\n\"D you think he ever passed this house?\"\n\nThe question, for the moment, seemed to Katharine to have reference to\nRalph Denham.\n\n\"On his way to Blackfriars, I mean,\" Mrs. Hilbery continued, \"for you\nknow the latest discovery is that he owned a house there.\"\n\nKatharine still looked about her in perplexity, and Mrs. Hilbery added:\n\n\"Which is a proof that he wasn t as poor as they ve sometimes said. I\nshould like to think that he had enough, though I don t in the least\nwant him to be rich.\"\n\nThen, perceiving her daughter s expression of perplexity, Mrs. Hilbery\nburst out laughing.\n\n\"My dear, I m not talking about _your_ William, though that s another\nreason for liking him. I m talking, I m thinking, I m dreaming of _my_\nWilliam William Shakespeare, of course. Isn t it odd,\" she mused,\nstanding at the window and tapping gently upon the pane, \"that for all\none can see, that dear old thing in the blue bonnet, crossing the road\nwith her basket on her arm, has never heard that there was such a\nperson? Yet it all goes on: lawyers hurrying to their work, cabmen\nsquabbling for their fares, little boys rolling their hoops, little\ngirls throwing bread to the gulls, as if there weren t a Shakespeare in\nthe world. I should like to stand at that crossing all day long and\nsay:  People, read Shakespeare! \"\n\nKatharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope. As\nShelley was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he were alive,\nit had, of course, considerable value. Her immediate task was to decide\nwhether the whole letter should be printed, or only the paragraph which\nmentioned Shelley s name, and she reached out for a pen and held it in\nreadiness to do justice upon the sheet. Her pen, however, remained in\nthe air. Almost surreptitiously she slipped a clean sheet in front of\nher, and her hand, descending, began drawing square boxes halved and\nquartered by straight lines, and then circles which underwent the same\nprocess of dissection.\n\n\"Katharine! I ve hit upon a brilliant idea!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed \"to\nlay out, say, a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare, and give\nthem to working men. Some of your clever friends who get up meetings\nmight help us, Katharine. And that might lead to a playhouse, where we\ncould all take parts. You d be Rosalind but you ve a dash of the old\nnurse in you. Your father s Hamlet, come to years of discretion; and\nI m well, I m a bit of them all; I m quite a large bit of the fool, but\nthe fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things. Now who shall\nWilliam be? A hero? Hotspur? Henry the Fifth? No, William s got a touch\nof Hamlet in him, too. I can fancy that William talks to himself when\nhe s alone. Ah, Katharine, you must say very beautiful things when\nyou re together!\" she added wistfully, with a glance at her daughter,\nwho had told her nothing about the dinner the night before.\n\n\"Oh, we talk a lot of nonsense,\" said Katharine, hiding her slip of\npaper as her mother stood by her, and spreading the old letter about\nShelley in front of her.\n\n\"It won t seem to you nonsense in ten years  time,\" said Mrs. Hilbery.\n\"Believe me, Katharine, you ll look back on these days afterwards;\nyou ll remember all the silly things you ve said; and you ll find that\nyour life has been built on them. The best of life is built on what we\nsay when we re in love. It isn t nonsense, Katharine,\" she urged, \"it s\nthe truth, it s the only truth.\"\n\nKatharine was on the point of interrupting her mother, and then she was\non the point of confiding in her. They came strangely close together\nsometimes. But, while she hesitated and sought for words not too\ndirect, her mother had recourse to Shakespeare, and turned page after\npage, set upon finding some quotation which said all this about love\nfar, far better than she could. Accordingly, Katharine did nothing but\nscrub one of her circles an intense black with her pencil, in the midst\nof which process the telephone-bell rang, and she left the room to\nanswer it.\n\nWhen she returned, Mrs. Hilbery had found not the passage she wanted,\nbut another of exquisite beauty as she justly observed, looking up for\na second to ask Katharine who that was?\n\n\"Mary Datchet,\" Katharine replied briefly.\n\n\"Ah I half wish I d called you Mary, but it wouldn t have gone with\nHilbery, and it wouldn t have gone with Rodney. Now this isn t the\npassage I wanted. (I never can find what I want.) But it s spring; it s\nthe daffodils; it s the green fields; it s the birds.\"\n\nShe was cut short in her quotation by another imperative\ntelephone-bell. Once more Katharine left the room.\n\n\"My dear child, how odious the triumphs of science are!\" Mrs. Hilbery\nexclaimed on her return. \"They ll be linking us with the moon next but\nwho was that?\"\n\n\"William,\" Katharine replied yet more briefly.\n\n\"I ll forgive William anything, for I m certain that there aren t any\nWilliams in the moon. I hope he s coming to luncheon?\"\n\n\"He s coming to tea.\"\n\n\"Well, that s better than nothing, and I promise to leave you alone.\"\n\n\"There s no need for you to do that,\" said Katharine.\n\nShe swept her hand over the faded sheet, and drew herself up squarely\nto the table as if she refused to waste time any longer. The gesture\nwas not lost upon her mother. It hinted at the existence of something\nstern and unapproachable in her daughter s character, which struck\nchill upon her, as the sight of poverty, or drunkenness, or the logic\nwith which Mr. Hilbery sometimes thought good to demolish her certainty\nof an approaching millennium struck chill upon her. She went back to\nher own table, and putting on her spectacles with a curious expression\nof quiet humility, addressed herself for the first time that morning to\nthe task before her. The shock with an unsympathetic world had a\nsobering effect on her. For once, her industry surpassed her\ndaughter s. Katharine could not reduce the world to that particular\nperspective in which Harriet Martineau, for instance, was a figure of\nsolid importance, and possessed of a genuine relationship to this\nfigure or to that date. Singularly enough, the sharp call of the\ntelephone-bell still echoed in her ear, and her body and mind were in a\nstate of tension, as if, at any moment, she might hear another summons\nof greater interest to her than the whole of the nineteenth century.\nShe did not clearly realize what this call was to be; but when the ears\nhave got into the habit of listening, they go on listening\ninvoluntarily, and thus Katharine spent the greater part of the morning\nin listening to a variety of sounds in the back streets of Chelsea. For\nthe first time in her life, probably, she wished that Mrs. Hilbery\nwould not keep so closely to her work. A quotation from Shakespeare\nwould not have come amiss. Now and again she heard a sigh from her\nmother s table, but that was the only proof she gave of her existence,\nand Katharine did not think of connecting it with the square aspect of\nher own position at the table, or, perhaps, she would have thrown her\npen down and told her mother the reason of her restlessness. The only\nwriting she managed to accomplish in the course of the morning was one\nletter, addressed to her cousin, Cassandra Otway a rambling letter,\nlong, affectionate, playful and commanding all at once. She bade\nCassandra put her creatures in the charge of a groom, and come to them\nfor a week or so. They would go and hear some music together.\nCassandra s dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation\nfast hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate\nher from all interesting people and pursuits. She was finishing the\nsheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck\nupon her ears. She jumped up hastily, and slammed the door with a\nsharpness which made Mrs. Hilbery start. Where was Katharine off to? In\nher preoccupied state she had not heard the bell.\n\nThe alcove on the stairs, in which the telephone was placed, was\nscreened for privacy by a curtain of purple velvet. It was a pocket for\nsuperfluous possessions, such as exist in most houses which harbor the\nwreckage of three generations. Prints of great-uncles, famed for their\nprowess in the East, hung above Chinese teapots, whose sides were\nriveted by little gold stitches, and the precious teapots, again, stood\nupon bookcases containing the complete works of William Cowper and Sir\nWalter Scott. The thread of sound, issuing from the telephone, was\nalways colored by the surroundings which received it, so it seemed to\nKatharine. Whose voice was now going to combine with them, or to strike\na discord?\n\n\"Whose voice?\" she asked herself, hearing a man inquire, with great\ndetermination, for her number. The unfamiliar voice now asked for Miss\nHilbery. Out of all the welter of voices which crowd round the far end\nof the telephone, out of the enormous range of possibilities, whose\nvoice, what possibility, was this? A pause gave her time to ask herself\nthis question. It was solved next moment.\n\n\"I ve looked out the train.... Early on Saturday afternoon would suit\nme best.... I m Ralph Denham.... But I ll write it down....\"\n\nWith more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point of a\nbayonet, Katharine replied:\n\n\"I think I could come. I ll look at my engagements.... Hold on.\"\n\nShe dropped the machine, and looked fixedly at the print of the\ngreat-uncle who had not ceased to gaze, with an air of amiable\nauthority, into a world which, as yet, beheld no symptoms of the Indian\nMutiny. And yet, gently swinging against the wall, within the black\ntube, was a voice which recked nothing of Uncle James, of China\nteapots, or of red velvet curtains. She watched the oscillation of the\ntube, and at the same moment became conscious of the individuality of\nthe house in which she stood; she heard the soft domestic sounds of\nregular existence upon staircases and floors above her head, and\nmovements through the wall in the house next door. She had no very\nclear vision of Denham himself, when she lifted the telephone to her\nlips and replied that she thought Saturday would suit her. She hoped\nthat he would not say good-bye at once, although she felt no particular\nanxiety to attend to what he was saying, and began, even while he\nspoke, to think of her own upper room, with its books, its papers\npressed between the leaves of dictionaries, and the table that could be\ncleared for work. She replaced the instrument, thoughtfully; her\nrestlessness was assuaged; she finished her letter to Cassandra without\ndifficulty, addressed the envelope, and fixed the stamp with her usual\nquick decision.\n\nA bunch of anemones caught Mrs. Hilbery s eye when they had finished\nluncheon. The blue and purple and white of the bowl, standing in a pool\nof variegated light on a polished Chippendale table in the drawing-room\nwindow, made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure.\n\n\"Who is lying ill in bed, Katharine?\" she demanded. \"Which of our\nfriends wants cheering up? Who feels that they ve been forgotten and\npassed over, and that nobody wants them? Whose water rates are overdue,\nand the cook leaving in a temper without waiting for her wages? There\nwas somebody I know \" she concluded, but for the moment the name of\nthis desirable acquaintance escaped her. The best representative of the\nforlorn company whose day would be brightened by a bunch of anemones\nwas, in Katharine s opinion, the widow of a general living in the\nCromwell Road. In default of the actually destitute and starving, whom\nshe would much have preferred, Mrs. Hilbery was forced to acknowledge\nher claims, for though in comfortable circumstances, she was extremely\ndull, unattractive, connected in some oblique fashion with literature,\nand had been touched to the verge of tears, on one occasion, by an\nafternoon call.\n\nIt happened that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere, so that the\ntask of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell upon Katharine.\nShe took her letter to Cassandra with her, meaning to post it in the\nfirst pillar-box she came to. When, however, she was fairly out of\ndoors, and constantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip\nher envelope down their scarlet throats, she forbore. She made absurd\nexcuses, as that she did not wish to cross the road, or that she was\ncertain to pass another post-office in a more central position a little\nfarther on. The longer she held the letter in her hand, however, the\nmore persistently certain questions pressed upon her, as if from a\ncollection of voices in the air. These invisible people wished to be\ninformed whether she was engaged to William Rodney, or was the\nengagement broken off? Was it right, they asked, to invite Cassandra\nfor a visit, and was William Rodney in love with her, or likely to fall\nin love? Then the questioners paused for a moment, and resumed as if\nanother side of the problem had just come to their notice. What did\nRalph Denham mean by what he said to you last night? Do you consider\nthat he is in love with you? Is it right to consent to a solitary walk\nwith him, and what advice are you going to give him about his future?\nHas William Rodney cause to be jealous of your conduct, and what do you\npropose to do about Mary Datchet? What are you going to do? What does\nhonor require you to do? they repeated.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" Katharine exclaimed, after listening to all these\nremarks, \"I suppose I ought to make up my mind.\"\n\nBut the debate was a formal skirmishing, a pastime to gain\nbreathing-space. Like all people brought up in a tradition, Katharine\nwas able, within ten minutes or so, to reduce any moral difficulty to\nits traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers. The book\nof wisdom lay open, if not upon her mother s knee, upon the knees of\nmany uncles and aunts. She had only to consult them, and they would at\nonce turn to the right page and read out an answer exactly suited to\none in her position. The rules which should govern the behavior of an\nunmarried woman are written in red ink, graved upon marble, if, by some\nfreak of nature, it should fall out that the unmarried woman has not\nthe same writing scored upon her heart. She was ready to believe that\nsome people are fortunate enough to reject, accept, resign, or lay down\ntheir lives at the bidding of traditional authority; she could envy\nthem; but in her case the questions became phantoms directly she tried\nseriously to find an answer, which proved that the traditional answer\nwould be of no use to her individually. Yet it had served so many\npeople, she thought, glancing at the rows of houses on either side of\nher, where families, whose incomes must be between a thousand and\nfifteen-hundred a year lived, and kept, perhaps, three servants, and\ndraped their windows with curtains which were always thick and\ngenerally dirty, and must, she thought, since you could only see a\nlooking-glass gleaming above a sideboard on which a dish of apples was\nset, keep the room inside very dark. But she turned her head away,\nobserving that this was not a method of thinking the matter out.\n\nThe only truth which she could discover was the truth of what she\nherself felt a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination\nshed by the eyes of all the people who are in agreement to see\ntogether; but having rejected the visionary voices, she had no choice\nbut to make this her guide through the dark masses which confronted\nher. She tried to follow her beam, with an expression upon her face\nwhich would have made any passer-by think her reprehensibly and almost\nridiculously detached from the surrounding scene. One would have felt\nalarmed lest this young and striking woman were about to do something\neccentric. But her beauty saved her from the worst fate that can befall\na pedestrian; people looked at her, but they did not laugh. To seek a\ntrue feeling among the chaos of the unfeelings or half-feelings of\nlife, to recognize it when found, and to accept the consequences of the\ndiscovery, draws lines upon the smoothest brow, while it quickens the\nlight of the eyes; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering,\ndebasing, and exalting, and, as Katharine speedily found, her\ndiscoveries gave her equal cause for surprise, shame, and intense\nanxiety. Much depended, as usual, upon the interpretation of the word\nlove; which word came up again and again, whether she considered\nRodney, Denham, Mary Datchet, or herself; and in each case it seemed to\nstand for something different, and yet for something unmistakable and\nsomething not to be passed by. For the more she looked into the\nconfusion of lives which, instead of running parallel, had suddenly\nintersected each other, the more distinctly she seemed to convince\nherself that there was no other light on them than was shed by this\nstrange illumination, and no other path save the one upon which it\nthrew its beams. Her blindness in the case of Rodney, her attempt to\nmatch his true feeling with her false feeling, was a failure never to\nbe sufficiently condemned; indeed, she could only pay it the tribute of\nleaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion\nor excuse.\n\nWith this to humiliate there was much to exalt. She thought of three\ndifferent scenes; she thought of Mary sitting upright and saying, \"I m\nin love I m in love\"; she thought of Rodney losing his\nself-consciousness among the dead leaves, and speaking with the\nabandonment of a child; she thought of Denham leaning upon the stone\nparapet and talking to the distant sky, so that she thought him mad.\nHer mind, passing from Mary to Denham, from William to Cassandra, and\nfrom Denham to herself if, as she rather doubted, Denham s state of\nmind was connected with herself seemed to be tracing out the lines of\nsome symmetrical pattern, some arrangement of life, which invested, if\nnot herself, at least the others, not only with interest, but with a\nkind of tragic beauty. She had a fantastic picture of them upholding\nsplendid palaces upon their bent backs. They were the lantern-bearers,\nwhose lights, scattered among the crowd, wove a pattern, dissolving,\njoining, meeting again in combination. Half forming such conceptions as\nthese in her rapid walk along the dreary streets of South Kensington,\nshe determined that, whatever else might be obscure, she must further\nthe objects of Mary, Denham, William, and Cassandra. The way was not\napparent. No course of action seemed to her indubitably right. All she\nachieved by her thinking was the conviction that, in such a cause, no\nrisk was too great; and that, far from making any rules for herself or\nothers, she would let difficulties accumulate unsolved, situations\nwiden their jaws unsatiated, while she maintained a position of\nabsolute and fearless independence. So she could best serve the people\nwho loved.\n\nRead in the light of this exaltation, there was a new meaning in the\nwords which her mother had penciled upon the card attached to the bunch\nof anemones. The door of the house in the Cromwell Road opened; gloomy\nvistas of passage and staircase were revealed; such light as there was\nseemed to be concentrated upon a silver salver of visiting-cards, whose\nblack borders suggested that the widow s friends had all suffered the\nsame bereavement. The parlor-maid could hardly be expected to fathom\nthe meaning of the grave tone in which the young lady proffered the\nflowers, with Mrs. Hilbery s love; and the door shut upon the offering.\n\nThe sight of a face, the slam of a door, are both rather destructive of\nexaltation in the abstract; and, as she walked back to Chelsea,\nKatharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves.\nIf you cannot make sure of people, however, you can hold fairly fast to\nfigures, and in some way or other her thought about such problems as\nshe was wont to consider worked in happily with her mood as to her\nfriends  lives. She reached home rather late for tea.\n\nOn the ancient Dutch chest in the hall she perceived one or two hats,\ncoats, and walking-sticks, and the sound of voices reached her as she\nstood outside the drawing-room door. Her mother gave a little cry as\nshe came in; a cry which conveyed to Katharine the fact that she was\nlate, that the teacups and milk-jugs were in a conspiracy of\ndisobedience, and that she must immediately take her place at the head\nof the table and pour out tea for the guests. Augustus Pelham, the\ndiarist, liked a calm atmosphere in which to tell his stories; he liked\nattention; he liked to elicit little facts, little stories, about the\npast and the great dead, from such distinguished characters as Mrs.\nHilbery for the nourishment of his diary, for whose sake he frequented\ntea-tables and ate yearly an enormous quantity of buttered toast. He,\ntherefore, welcomed Katharine with relief, and she had merely to shake\nhands with Rodney and to greet the American lady who had come to be\nshown the relics, before the talk started again on the broad lines of\nreminiscence and discussion which were familiar to her.\n\nYet, even with this thick veil between them, she could not help looking\nat Rodney, as if she could detect what had happened to him since they\nmet. It was in vain. His clothes, even the white slip, the pearl in his\ntie, seemed to intercept her quick glance, and to proclaim the futility\nof such inquiries of a discreet, urbane gentleman, who balanced his cup\nof tea and poised a slice of bread and butter on the edge of the\nsaucer. He would not meet her eye, but that could be accounted for by\nhis activity in serving and helping, and the polite alacrity with which\nhe was answering the questions of the American visitor.\n\nIt was certainly a sight to daunt any one coming in with a head full of\ntheories about love. The voices of the invisible questioners were\nreinforced by the scene round the table, and sounded with a tremendous\nself-confidence, as if they had behind them the common sense of twenty\ngenerations, together with the immediate approval of Mr. Augustus\nPelham, Mrs. Vermont Bankes, William Rodney, and, possibly, Mrs.\nHilbery herself. Katharine set her teeth, not entirely in the\nmetaphorical sense, for her hand, obeying the impulse towards definite\naction, laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had\nbeen grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness. The address was\nuppermost, and a moment later she saw William s eye rest upon it as he\nrose to fulfil some duty with a plate. His expression instantly\nchanged. He did what he was on the point of doing, and then looked at\nKatharine with a look which revealed enough of his confusion to show\nher that he was not entirely represented by his appearance. In a minute\nor two he proved himself at a loss with Mrs. Vermont Bankes, and Mrs.\nHilbery, aware of the silence with her usual quickness, suggested that,\nperhaps, it was now time that Mrs. Bankes should be shown \"our things.\"\n\nKatharine accordingly rose, and led the way to the little inner room\nwith the pictures and the books. Mrs. Bankes and Rodney followed her.\n\nShe turned on the lights, and began directly in her low, pleasant\nvoice: \"This table is my grandfather s writing-table. Most of the later\npoems were written at it. And this is his pen the last pen he ever\nused.\" She took it in her hand and paused for the right number of\nseconds. \"Here,\" she continued, \"is the original manuscript of the  Ode\nto Winter.  The early manuscripts are far less corrected than the later\nones, as you will see directly.... Oh, do take it yourself,\" she added,\nas Mrs. Bankes asked, in an awestruck tone of voice, for that\nprivilege, and began a preliminary unbuttoning of her white kid gloves.\n\n\"You are wonderfully like your grandfather, Miss Hilbery,\" the American\nlady observed, gazing from Katharine to the portrait, \"especially about\nthe eyes. Come, now, I expect she writes poetry herself, doesn t she?\"\nshe asked in a jocular tone, turning to William. \"Quite one s ideal of\na poet, is it not, Mr. Rodney? I cannot tell you what a privilege I\nfeel it to be standing just here with the poet s granddaughter. You\nmust know we think a great deal of your grandfather in America, Miss\nHilbery. We have societies for reading him aloud. What! His very own\nslippers!\" Laying aside the manuscript, she hastily grasped the old\nshoes, and remained for a moment dumb in contemplation of them.\n\nWhile Katharine went on steadily with her duties as show-woman, Rodney\nexamined intently a row of little drawings which he knew by heart\nalready. His disordered state of mind made it necessary for him to take\nadvantage of these little respites, as if he had been out in a high\nwind and must straighten his dress in the first shelter he reached. His\ncalm was only superficial, as he knew too well; it did not exist much\nbelow the surface of tie, waistcoat, and white slip.\n\nOn getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind to\nignore what had been said the night before; he had been convinced, by\nthe sight of Denham, that his love for Katharine was passionate, and\nwhen he addressed her early that morning on the telephone, he had meant\nhis cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to her the fact that,\nafter a night of madness, they were as indissolubly engaged as ever.\nBut when he reached his office his torments began. He found a letter\nfrom Cassandra waiting for him. She had read his play, and had taken\nthe very first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of\nit. She knew, she wrote, that her praise meant absolutely nothing; but\nstill, she had sat up all night; she thought this, that, and the other;\nshe was full of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places,\nbut enough was written plain to gratify William s vanity exceedingly.\nShe was quite intelligent enough to say the right things, or, even more\ncharmingly, to hint at them. In other ways, too, it was a very charming\nletter. She told him about her music, and about a Suffrage meeting to\nwhich Henry had taken her, and she asserted, half seriously, that she\nhad learnt the Greek alphabet, and found it \"fascinating.\" The word was\nunderlined. Had she laughed when she drew that line? Was she ever\nserious? Didn t the letter show the most engaging compound of\nenthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality, all tapering into a flame of\ngirlish freakishness, which flitted, for the rest of the morning, as a\nwill-o -the-wisp, across Rodney s landscape. He could not resist\nbeginning an answer to her there and then. He found it particularly\ndelightful to shape a style which should express the bowing and\ncurtsying, advancing and retreating, which are characteristic of one of\nthe many million partnerships of men and women. Katharine never trod\nthat particular measure, he could not help reflecting;\nKatharine Cassandra; Cassandra Katharine they alternated in his\nconsciousness all day long. It was all very well to dress oneself\ncarefully, compose one s face, and start off punctually at half-past\nfour to a tea-party in Cheyne Walk, but Heaven only knew what would\ncome of it all, and when Katharine, after sitting silent with her usual\nimmobility, wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table\nbeneath his eyes a letter addressed to Cassandra herself, his composure\ndeserted him. What did she mean by her behavior?\n\nHe looked up sharply from his row of little pictures. Katharine was\ndisposing of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion. Surely\nthe victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms appeared in the\neyes of the poet s granddaughter. Katharine never made any attempt to\nspare people s feelings, he reflected; and, being himself very\nsensitive to all shades of comfort and discomfort, he cut short the\nauctioneer s catalog, which Katharine was reeling off more and more\nabsent-mindedly, and took Mrs. Vermont Bankes, with a queer sense of\nfellowship in suffering, under his own protection.\n\nBut within a few minutes the American lady had completed her\ninspection, and inclining her head in a little nod of reverential\nfarewell to the poet and his shoes, she was escorted downstairs by\nRodney. Katharine stayed by herself in the little room. The ceremony of\nancestor-worship had been more than usually oppressive to her.\nMoreover, the room was becoming crowded beyond the bounds of order.\nOnly that morning a heavily insured proof-sheet had reached them from a\ncollector in Australia, which recorded a change of the poet s mind\nabout a very famous phrase, and, therefore, had claims to the honor of\nglazing and framing. But was there room for it? Must it be hung on the\nstaircase, or should some other relic give place to do it honor?\nFeeling unable to decide the question, Katharine glanced at the\nportrait of her grandfather, as if to ask his opinion. The artist who\nhad painted it was now out of fashion, and by dint of showing it to\nvisitors, Katharine had almost ceased to see anything but a glow of\nfaintly pleasing pink and brown tints, enclosed within a circular\nscroll of gilt laurel-leaves. The young man who was her grandfather\nlooked vaguely over her head. The sensual lips were slightly parted,\nand gave the face an expression of beholding something lovely or\nmiraculous vanishing or just rising upon the rim of the distance. The\nexpression repeated itself curiously upon Katharine s face as she gazed\nup into his. They were the same age, or very nearly so. She wondered\nwhat he was looking for; were there waves beating upon a shore for him,\ntoo, she wondered, and heroes riding through the leaf-hung forests? For\nperhaps the first time in her life she thought of him as a man, young,\nunhappy, tempestuous, full of desires and faults; for the first time\nshe realized him for herself, and not from her mother s memory. He\nmight have been her brother, she thought. It seemed to her that they\nwere akin, with the mysterious kinship of blood which makes it seem\npossible to interpret the sights which the eyes of the dead behold so\nintently, or even to believe that they look with us upon our present\njoys and sorrows. He would have understood, she thought, suddenly; and\ninstead of laying her withered flowers upon his shrine, she brought him\nher own perplexities perhaps a gift of greater value, should the dead\nbe conscious of gifts, than flowers and incense and adoration. Doubts,\nquestionings, and despondencies she felt, as she looked up, would be\nmore welcome to him than homage, and he would hold them but a very\nsmall burden if she gave him, also, some share in what she suffered and\nachieved. The depth of her own pride and love were not more apparent to\nher than the sense that the dead asked neither flowers nor regrets, but\na share in the life which they had given her, the life which they had\nlived.\n\nRodney found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfather s\nportrait. She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Come and sit down, William. How glad I was you were here! I felt\nmyself getting ruder and ruder.\"\n\n\"You are not good at hiding your feelings,\" he returned dryly.\n\n\"Oh, don t scold me I ve had a horrid afternoon.\" She told him how she\nhad taken the flowers to Mrs. McCormick, and how South Kensington\nimpressed her as the preserve of officers  widows. She described how\nthe door had opened, and what gloomy avenues of busts and palm-trees\nand umbrellas had been revealed to her. She spoke lightly, and\nsucceeded in putting him at his ease. Indeed, he rapidly became too\nmuch at his ease to persist in a condition of cheerful neutrality. He\nfelt his composure slipping from him. Katharine made it seem so natural\nto ask her to help him, or advise him, to say straight out what he had\nin his mind. The letter from Cassandra was heavy in his pocket. There\nwas also the letter to Cassandra lying on the table in the next room.\nThe atmosphere seemed charged with Cassandra. But, unless Katharine\nbegan the subject of her own accord, he could not even hint he must\nignore the whole affair; it was the part of a gentleman to preserve a\nbearing that was, as far as he could make it, the bearing of an\nundoubting lover. At intervals he sighed deeply. He talked rather more\nquickly than usual about the possibility that some of the operas of\nMozart would be played in the summer. He had received a notice, he\nsaid, and at once produced a pocket-book stuffed with papers, and began\nshuffling them in search. He held a thick envelope between his finger\nand thumb, as if the notice from the opera company had become in some\nway inseparably attached to it.\n\n\"A letter from Cassandra?\" said Katharine, in the easiest voice in the\nworld, looking over his shoulder. \"I ve just written to ask her to come\nhere, only I forgot to post it.\"\n\nHe handed her the envelope in silence. She took it, extracted the\nsheets, and read the letter through.\n\nThe reading seemed to Rodney to take an intolerably long time.\n\n\"Yes,\" she observed at length, \"a very charming letter.\"\n\nRodney s face was half turned away, as if in bashfulness. Her view of\nhis profile almost moved her to laughter. She glanced through the pages\nonce more.\n\n\"I see no harm,\" William blurted out, \"in helping her with Greek, for\nexample if she really cares for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"There s no reason why she shouldn t care,\" said Katharine, consulting\nthe pages once more. \"In fact ah, here it is  The Greek alphabet is\nabsolutely _fascinating_.  Obviously she does care.\"\n\n\"Well, Greek may be rather a large order. I was thinking chiefly of\nEnglish. Her criticisms of my play, though they re too generous,\nevidently immature she can t be more than twenty-two, I suppose? they\ncertainly show the sort of thing one wants: real feeling for poetry,\nunderstanding, not formed, of course, but it s at the root of\neverything after all. There d be no harm in lending her books?\"\n\n\"No. Certainly not.\"\n\n\"But if it hum led to a correspondence? I mean, Katharine, I take it,\nwithout going into matters which seem to me a little morbid, I mean,\"\nhe floundered, \"you, from your point of view, feel that there s nothing\ndisagreeable to you in the notion? If so, you ve only to speak, and I\nnever think of it again.\"\n\nShe was surprised by the violence of her desire that he never should\nthink of it again. For an instant it seemed to her impossible to\nsurrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love, but was\ncertainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman in the world.\nCassandra would never understand him she was not good enough for him.\nThe letter seemed to her a letter of flattery a letter addressed to his\nweakness, which it made her angry to think was known to another. For he\nwas not weak; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised she\nhad only to speak, and he would never think of Cassandra again.\n\nShe paused. Rodney guessed the reason. He was amazed.\n\n\"She loves me,\" he thought. The woman he admired more than any one in\nthe world, loved him, as he had given up hope that she would ever love\nhim. And now that for the first time he was sure of her love, he\nresented it. He felt it as a fetter, an encumbrance, something which\nmade them both, but him in particular, ridiculous. He was in her power\ncompletely, but his eyes were open and he was no longer her slave or\nher dupe. He would be her master in future. The instant prolonged\nitself as Katharine realized the strength of her desire to speak the\nwords that should keep William for ever, and the baseness of the\ntemptation which assailed her to make the movement, or speak the word,\nwhich he had often begged her for, which she was now near enough to\nfeeling. She held the letter in her hand. She sat silent.\n\nAt this moment there was a stir in the other room; the voice of Mrs.\nHilbery was heard talking of proof-sheets rescued by miraculous\nprovidence from butcher s ledgers in Australia; the curtain separating\none room from the other was drawn apart, and Mrs. Hilbery and Augustus\nPelham stood in the doorway. Mrs. Hilbery stopped short. She looked at\nher daughter, and at the man her daughter was to marry, with her\npeculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on the brink of satire.\n\n\"The best of all my treasures, Mr. Pelham!\" she exclaimed. \"Don t move,\nKatharine. Sit still, William. Mr. Pelham will come another day.\"\n\nMr. Pelham looked, smiled, bowed, and, as his hostess had moved on,\nfollowed her without a word. The curtain was drawn again either by him\nor by Mrs. Hilbery.\n\nBut her mother had settled the question somehow. Katharine doubted no\nlonger.\n\n\"As I told you last night,\" she said, \"I think it s your duty, if\nthere s a chance that you care for Cassandra, to discover what your\nfeeling is for her now. It s your duty to her, as well as to me. But we\nmust tell my mother. We can t go on pretending.\"\n\n\"That is entirely in your hands, of course,\" said Rodney, with an\nimmediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Katharine.\n\nDirectly he left her she would go to her mother, and explain that the\nengagement was at an end or it might be better that they should go\ntogether?\n\n\"But, Katharine,\" Rodney began, nervously attempting to stuff\nCassandra s sheets back into their envelope; \"if Cassandra should\nCassandra you ve asked Cassandra to stay with you.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I ve not posted the letter.\"\n\nHe crossed his knees in a discomfited silence. By all his codes it was\nimpossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken off his\nengagement to help him to become acquainted with another woman with a\nview to his falling in love with her. If it was announced that their\nengagement was over, a long and complete separation would inevitably\nfollow; in those circumstances, letters and gifts were returned; after\nyears of distance the severed couple met, perhaps at an evening party,\nand touched hands uncomfortably with an indifferent word or two. He\nwould be cast off completely; he would have to trust to his own\nresources. He could never mention Cassandra to Katharine again; for\nmonths, and doubtless years, he would never see Katharine again;\nanything might happen to her in his absence.\n\nKatharine was almost as well aware of his perplexities as he was. She\nknew in what direction complete generosity pointed the way; but\npride for to remain engaged to Rodney and to cover his experiments hurt\nwhat was nobler in her than mere vanity fought for its life.\n\n\"I m to give up my freedom for an indefinite time,\" she thought, \"in\norder that William may see Cassandra here at his ease. He s not the\ncourage to manage it without my help he s too much of a coward to tell\nme openly what he wants. He hates the notion of a public breach. He\nwants to keep us both.\"\n\nWhen she reached this point, Rodney pocketed the letter and elaborately\nlooked at his watch. Although the action meant that he resigned\nCassandra, for he knew his own incompetence and distrusted himself\nentirely, and lost Katharine, for whom his feeling was profound though\nunsatisfactory, still it appeared to him that there was nothing else\nleft for him to do. He was forced to go, leaving Katharine free, as he\nhad said, to tell her mother that the engagement was at an end. But to\ndo what plain duty required of an honorable man, cost an effort which\nonly a day or two ago would have been inconceivable to him. That a\nrelationship such as he had glanced at with desire could be possible\nbetween him and Katharine, he would have been the first, two days ago,\nto deny with indignation. But now his life had changed; his attitude\nhad changed; his feelings were different; new aims and possibilities\nhad been shown him, and they had an almost irresistible fascination and\nforce. The training of a life of thirty-five years had not left him\ndefenceless; he was still master of his dignity; he rose, with a mind\nmade up to an irrevocable farewell.\n\n\"I leave you, then,\" he said, standing up and holding out his hand with\nan effort that left him pale, but lent him dignity, \"to tell your\nmother that our engagement is ended by your desire.\"\n\nShe took his hand and held it.\n\n\"You don t trust me?\" she said.\n\n\"I do, absolutely,\" he replied.\n\n\"No. You don t trust me to help you.... I could help you?\"\n\n\"I m hopeless without your help!\" he exclaimed passionately, but\nwithdrew his hand and turned his back. When he faced her, she thought\nthat she saw him for the first time without disguise.\n\n\"It s useless to pretend that I don t understand what you re offering,\nKatharine. I admit what you say. Speaking to you perfectly frankly, I\nbelieve at this moment that I do love your cousin; there is a chance\nthat, with your help, I might but no,\" he broke off, \"it s impossible,\nit s wrong I m infinitely to blame for having allowed this situation to\narise.\"\n\n\"Sit beside me. Let s consider sensibly \"\n\n\"Your sense has been our undoing \" he groaned.\n\n\"I accept the responsibility.\"\n\n\"Ah, but can I allow that?\" he exclaimed. \"It would mean for we must\nface it, Katharine that we let our engagement stand for the time\nnominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be absolute.\"\n\n\"And yours too.\"\n\n\"Yes, we should both be free. Let us say that I saw Cassandra once,\ntwice, perhaps, under these conditions; and then if, as I think\ncertain, the whole thing proves a dream, we tell your mother instantly.\nWhy not tell her now, indeed, under pledge of secrecy?\"\n\n\"Why not? It would be over London in ten minutes, besides, she would\nnever even remotely understand.\"\n\n\"Your father, then? This secrecy is detestable it s dishonorable.\"\n\n\"My father would understand even less than my mother.\"\n\n\"Ah, who could be expected to understand?\" Rodney groaned; \"but it s\nfrom your point of view that we must look at it. It s not only asking\ntoo much, it s putting you into a position a position in which I could\nnot endure to see my own sister.\"\n\n\"We re not brothers and sisters,\" she said impatiently, \"and if we\ncan t decide, who can? I m not talking nonsense,\" she proceeded. \"I ve\ndone my best to think this out from every point of view, and I ve come\nto the conclusion that there are risks which have to be taken, though I\ndon t deny that they hurt horribly.\"\n\n\"Katharine, you mind? You ll mind too much.\"\n\n\"No I shan t,\" she said stoutly. \"I shall mind a good deal, but I m\nprepared for that; I shall get through it, because you will help me.\nYou ll both help me. In fact, we ll help each other. That s a Christian\ndoctrine, isn t it?\"\n\n\"It sounds more like Paganism to me,\" Rodney groaned, as he reviewed\nthe situation into which her Christian doctrine was plunging them.\n\nAnd yet he could not deny that a divine relief possessed him, and that\nthe future, instead of wearing a lead-colored mask, now blossomed with\na thousand varied gaieties and excitements. He was actually to see\nCassandra within a week or perhaps less, and he was more anxious to\nknow the date of her arrival than he could own even to himself. It\nseemed base to be so anxious to pluck this fruit of Katharine s\nunexampled generosity and of his own contemptible baseness. And yet,\nthough he used these words automatically, they had now no meaning. He\nwas not debased in his own eyes by what he had done, and as for\npraising Katharine, were they not partners, conspirators, people bent\nupon the same quest together, so that to praise the pursuit of a common\nend as an act of generosity was meaningless. He took her hand and\npressed it, not in thanks so much as in an ecstasy of comradeship.\n\n\"We will help each other,\" he said, repeating her words, seeking her\neyes in an enthusiasm of friendship.\n\nHer eyes were grave but dark with sadness as they rested on him. \"He s\nalready gone,\" she thought, \"far away he thinks of me no more.\" And the\nfancy came to her that, as they sat side by side, hand in hand, she\ncould hear the earth pouring from above to make a barrier between them,\nso that, as they sat, they were separated second by second by an\nimpenetrable wall. The process, which affected her as that of being\nsealed away and for ever from all companionship with the person she\ncared for most, came to an end at last, and by common consent they\nunclasped their fingers, Rodney touching hers with his lips, as the\ncurtain parted, and Mrs. Hilbery peered through the opening with her\nbenevolent and sarcastic expression to ask whether Katharine could\nremember was it Tuesday or Wednesday, and did she dine in Westminster?\n\n\"Dearest William,\" she said, pausing, as if she could not resist the\npleasure of encroaching for a second upon this wonderful world of love\nand confidence and romance. \"Dearest children,\" she added, disappearing\nwith an impulsive gesture, as if she forced herself to draw the curtain\nupon a scene which she refused all temptation to interrupt.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXV\n\n\nAt a quarter-past three in the afternoon of the following Saturday\nRalph Denham sat on the bank of the lake in Kew Gardens, dividing the\ndial-plate of his watch into sections with his forefinger. The just and\ninexorable nature of time itself was reflected in his face. He might\nhave been composing a hymn to the unhasting and unresting march of that\ndivinity. He seemed to greet the lapse of minute after minute with\nstern acquiescence in the inevitable order. His expression was so\nsevere, so serene, so immobile, that it seemed obvious that for him at\nleast there was a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty\nirritation on his part was to mar, although the wasting time wasted\nalso high private hopes of his own.\n\nHis face was no bad index to what went on within him. He was in a\ncondition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily\nlife. He could not accept the fact that a lady was fifteen minutes late\nin keeping her appointment without seeing in that accident the\nfrustration of his entire life. Looking at his watch, he seemed to look\ndeep into the springs of human existence, and by the light of what he\nsaw there altered his course towards the north and the midnight....\nYes, one s voyage must be made absolutely without companions through\nice and black water towards what goal? Here he laid his finger upon the\nhalf-hour, and decided that when the minute-hand reached that point he\nwould go, at the same time answering the question put by another of the\nmany voices of consciousness with the reply that there was undoubtedly\na goal, but that it would need the most relentless energy to keep\nanywhere in its direction. Still, still, one goes on, the ticking\nseconds seemed to assure him, with dignity, with open eyes, with\ndetermination not to accept the second-rate, not to be tempted by the\nunworthy, not to yield, not to compromise. Twenty-five minutes past\nthree were now marked upon the face of the watch. The world, he assured\nhimself, since Katharine Hilbery was now half an hour behind her time,\noffers no happiness, no rest from struggle, no certainty. In a scheme\nof things utterly bad from the start the only unpardonable folly is\nthat of hope. Raising his eyes for a moment from the face of his watch,\nhe rested them upon the opposite bank, reflectively and not without a\ncertain wistfulness, as if the sternness of their gaze were still\ncapable of mitigation. Soon a look of the deepest satisfaction filled\nthem, though, for a moment, he did not move. He watched a lady who came\nrapidly, and yet with a trace of hesitation, down the broad grass-walk\ntowards him. She did not see him. Distance lent her figure an\nindescribable height, and romance seemed to surround her from the\nfloating of a purple veil which the light air filled and curved from\nher shoulders.\n\n\"Here she comes, like a ship in full sail,\" he said to himself, half\nremembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down\nthus with feathers flying and airs saluting her. The greenery and the\nhigh presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at\nher coming. He rose, and she saw him; her little exclamation proved\nthat she was glad to find him, and then that she blamed herself for\nbeing late.\n\n\"Why did you never tell me? I didn t know there was this,\" she\nremarked, alluding to the lake, the broad green space, the vista of\ntrees, with the ruffled gold of the Thames in the distance and the\nDucal castle standing in its meadows. She paid the rigid tail of the\nDucal lion the tribute of incredulous laughter.\n\n\"You ve never been to Kew?\" Denham remarked.\n\nBut it appeared that she had come once as a small child, when the\ngeography of the place was entirely different, and the fauna included\ncertainly flamingoes and, possibly, camels. They strolled on,\nrefashioning these legendary gardens. She was, as he felt, glad merely\nto stroll and loiter and let her fancy touch upon anything her eyes\nencountered a bush, a park-keeper, a decorated goose as if the\nrelaxation soothed her. The warmth of the afternoon, the first of\nspring, tempted them to sit upon a seat in a glade of beech-trees, with\nforest drives striking green paths this way and that around them. She\nsighed deeply.\n\n\"It s so peaceful,\" she said, as if in explanation of her sigh. Not a\nsingle person was in sight, and the stir of the wind in the branches,\nthat sound so seldom heard by Londoners, seemed to her as if wafted\nfrom fathomless oceans of sweet air in the distance.\n\nWhile she breathed and looked, Denham was engaged in uncovering with\nthe point of his stick a group of green spikes half smothered by the\ndead leaves. He did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist. In\nnaming the little green plant to her he used the Latin name, thus\ndisguising some flower familiar even to Chelsea, and making her\nexclaim, half in amusement, at his knowledge. Her own ignorance was\nvast, she confessed. What did one call that tree opposite, for\ninstance, supposing one condescended to call it by its English name?\nBeech or elm or sycamore? It chanced, by the testimony of a dead leaf,\nto be oak; and a little attention to a diagram which Denham proceeded\nto draw upon an envelope soon put Katharine in possession of some of\nthe fundamental distinctions between our British trees. She then asked\nhim to inform her about flowers. To her they were variously shaped and\ncolored petals, poised, at different seasons of the year, upon very\nsimilar green stalks; but to him they were, in the first instance,\nbulbs or seeds, and later, living things endowed with sex, and pores,\nand susceptibilities which adapted themselves by all manner of\ningenious devices to live and beget life, and could be fashioned squat\nor tapering, flame-colored or pale, pure or spotted, by processes which\nmight reveal the secrets of human existence. Denham spoke with\nincreasing ardor of a hobby which had long been his in secret. No\ndiscourse could have worn a more welcome sound in Katharine s ears. For\nweeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant music in her mind.\nIt wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses of her being where\nloneliness had brooded so long undisturbed.\n\nShe wished he would go on for ever talking of plants, and showing her\nhow science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled their endless\nvariations. A law that might be inscrutable but was certainly\nomnipotent appealed to her at the moment, because she could find\nnothing like it in possession of human lives. Circumstances had long\nforced her, as they force most women in the flower of youth, to\nconsider, painfully and minutely, all that part of life which is\nconspicuously without order; she had had to consider moods and wishes,\ndegrees of liking or disliking, and their effect upon the destiny of\npeople dear to her; she had been forced to deny herself any\ncontemplation of that other part of life where thought constructs a\ndestiny which is independent of human beings. As Denham spoke, she\nfollowed his words and considered their bearing with an easy vigor\nwhich spoke of a capacity long hoarded and unspent. The very trees and\nthe green merging into the blue distance became symbols of the vast\nexternal world which recks so little of the happiness, of the marriages\nor deaths of individuals. In order to give her examples of what he was\nsaying, Denham led the way, first to the Rock Garden, and then to the\nOrchid House.\n\nFor him there was safety in the direction which the talk had taken. His\nemphasis might come from feelings more personal than those science\nroused in him, but it was disguised, and naturally he found it easy to\nexpound and explain. Nevertheless, when he saw Katharine among the\norchids, her beauty strangely emphasized by the fantastic plants, which\nseemed to peer and gape at her from striped hoods and fleshy throats,\nhis ardor for botany waned, and a more complex feeling replaced it. She\nfell silent. The orchids seemed to suggest absorbing reflections. In\ndefiance of the rules she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one.\nThe sight of the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably\nthat he started and turned away. But next moment he controlled himself;\nhe looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with the\ncontemplative, considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly what\nis before him, but gropes in regions that lie beyond it. The far-away\nlook entirely lacked self-consciousness. Denham doubted whether she\nremembered his presence. He could recall himself, of course, by a word\nor a movement but why? She was happier thus. She needed nothing that he\ncould give her. And for him, too, perhaps, it was best to keep aloof,\nonly to know that she existed, to preserve what he already had perfect,\nremote, and unbroken. Further, her still look, standing among the\norchids in that hot atmosphere, strangely illustrated some scene that\nhe had imagined in his room at home. The sight, mingling with his\nrecollection, kept him silent when the door was shut and they were\nwalking on again.\n\nBut though she did not speak, Katharine had an uneasy sense that\nsilence on her part was selfishness. It was selfish of her to continue,\nas she wished to do, a discussion of subjects not remotely connected\nwith any human beings. She roused herself to consider their exact\nposition upon the turbulent map of the emotions. Oh yes it was a\nquestion whether Ralph Denham should live in the country and write a\nbook; it was getting late; they must waste no more time; Cassandra\narrived to-night for dinner; she flinched and roused herself, and\ndiscovered that she ought to be holding something in her hands. But\nthey were empty. She held them out with an exclamation.\n\n\"I ve left my bag somewhere where?\" The gardens had no points of the\ncompass, so far as she was concerned. She had been walking for the most\npart on grass that was all she knew. Even the road to the Orchid House\nhad now split itself into three. But there was no bag in the Orchid\nHouse. It must, therefore, have been left upon the seat. They retraced\ntheir steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think about\nsomething that is lost. What did this bag look like? What did it\ncontain?\n\n\"A purse a ticket some letters, papers,\" Katharine counted, becoming\nmore agitated as she recalled the list. Denham went on quickly in\nadvance of her, and she heard him shout that he had found it before she\nreached the seat. In order to make sure that all was safe she spread\nthe contents on her knee. It was a queer collection, Denham thought,\ngazing with the deepest interest. Loose gold coins were tangled in a\nnarrow strip of lace; there were letters which somehow suggested the\nextreme of intimacy; there were two or three keys, and lists of\ncommissions against which crosses were set at intervals. But she did\nnot seem satisfied until she had made sure of a certain paper so folded\nthat Denham could not judge what it contained. In her relief and\ngratitude she began at once to say that she had been thinking over what\nDenham had told her of his plans.\n\nHe cut her short. \"Don t let s discuss that dreary business.\"\n\n\"But I thought \"\n\n\"It s a dreary business. I ought never to have bothered you \"\n\n\"Have you decided, then?\"\n\nHe made an impatient sound. \"It s not a thing that matters.\"\n\nShe could only say rather flatly, \"Oh!\"\n\n\"I mean it matters to me, but it matters to no one else. Anyhow,\" he\ncontinued, more amiably, \"I see no reason why you should be bothered\nwith other people s nuisances.\"\n\nShe supposed that she had let him see too clearly her weariness of this\nside of life.\n\n\"I m afraid I ve been absent-minded,\" she began, remembering how often\nWilliam had brought this charge against her.\n\n\"You have a good deal to make you absent-minded,\" he replied.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, flushing. \"No,\" she contradicted herself. \"Nothing\nparticular, I mean. But I was thinking about plants. I was enjoying\nmyself. In fact, I ve seldom enjoyed an afternoon more. But I want to\nhear what you ve settled, if you don t mind telling me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it s all settled,\" he replied. \"I m going to this infernal cottage\nto write a worthless book.\"\n\n\"How I envy you,\" she replied, with the utmost sincerity.\n\n\"Well, cottages are to be had for fifteen shillings a week.\"\n\n\"Cottages are to be had yes,\" she replied. \"The question is \" She\nchecked herself. \"Two rooms are all I should want,\" she continued, with\na curious sigh; \"one for eating, one for sleeping. Oh, but I should\nlike another, a large one at the top, and a little garden where one\ncould grow flowers. A path so down to a river, or up to a wood, and the\nsea not very far off, so that one could hear the waves at night. Ships\njust vanishing on the horizon \" She broke off. \"Shall you be near the\nsea?\"\n\n\"My notion of perfect happiness,\" he began, not replying to her\nquestion, \"is to live as you ve said.\"\n\n\"Well, now you can. You will work, I suppose,\" she continued; \"you ll\nwork all the morning and again after tea and perhaps at night. You\nwon t have people always coming about you to interrupt.\"\n\n\"How far can one live alone?\" he asked. \"Have you tried ever?\"\n\n\"Once for three weeks,\" she replied. \"My father and mother were in\nItaly, and something happened so that I couldn t join them. For three\nweeks I lived entirely by myself, and the only person I spoke to was a\nstranger in a shop where I lunched a man with a beard. Then I went back\nto my room by myself and well, I did what I liked. It doesn t make me\nout an amiable character, I m afraid,\" she added, \"but I can t endure\nliving with other people. An occasional man with a beard is\ninteresting; he s detached; he lets me go my way, and we know we shall\nnever meet again. Therefore, we are perfectly sincere a thing not\npossible with one s friends.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Denham replied abruptly.\n\n\"Why  nonsense ?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Because you don t mean what you say,\" he expostulated.\n\n\"You re very positive,\" she said, laughing and looking at him. How\narbitrary, hot-tempered, and imperious he was! He had asked her to come\nto Kew to advise him; he then told her that he had settled the question\nalready; he then proceeded to find fault with her. He was the very\nopposite of William Rodney, she thought; he was shabby, his clothes\nwere badly made, he was ill versed in the amenities of life; he was\ntongue-tied and awkward to the verge of obliterating his real\ncharacter. He was awkwardly silent; he was awkwardly emphatic. And yet\nshe liked him.\n\n\"I don t mean what I say,\" she repeated good-humoredly. \"Well ?\"\n\n\"I doubt whether you make absolute sincerity your standard in life,\" he\nanswered significantly.\n\nShe flushed. He had penetrated at once to the weak spot her engagement,\nand had reason for what he said. He was not altogether justified now,\nat any rate, she was glad to remember; but she could not enlighten him\nand must bear his insinuations, though from the lips of a man who had\nbehaved as he had behaved their force should not have been sharp.\nNevertheless, what he said had its force, she mused; partly because he\nseemed unconscious of his own lapse in the case of Mary Datchet, and\nthus baffled her insight; partly because he always spoke with force,\nfor what reason she did not yet feel certain.\n\n\"Absolute sincerity is rather difficult, don t you think?\" she\ninquired, with a touch of irony.\n\n\"There are people one credits even with that,\" he replied a little\nvaguely. He was ashamed of his savage wish to hurt her, and yet it was\nnot for the sake of hurting her, who was beyond his shafts, but in\norder to mortify his own incredibly reckless impulse of abandonment to\nthe spirit which seemed, at moments, about to rush him to the uttermost\nends of the earth. She affected him beyond the scope of his wildest\ndreams. He seemed to see that beneath the quiet surface of her manner,\nwhich was almost pathetically at hand and within reach for all the\ntrivial demands of daily life, there was a spirit which she reserved or\nrepressed for some reason either of loneliness or could it be\npossible of love. Was it given to Rodney to see her unmasked,\nunrestrained, unconscious of her duties? a creature of uncalculating\npassion and instinctive freedom? No; he refused to believe it. It was\nin her loneliness that Katharine was unreserved. \"I went back to my\nroom by myself and I did what I liked.\" She had said that to him, and\nin saying it had given him a glimpse of possibilities, even of\nconfidences, as if he might be the one to share her loneliness, the\nmere hint of which made his heart beat faster and his brain spin. He\nchecked himself as brutally as he could. He saw her redden, and in the\nirony of her reply he heard her resentment.\n\nHe began slipping his smooth, silver watch in his pocket, in the hope\nthat somehow he might help himself back to that calm and fatalistic\nmood which had been his when he looked at its face upon the bank of the\nlake, for that mood must, at whatever cost, be the mood of his\nintercourse with Katharine. He had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence\nin the letter which he had never sent, and now all the force of his\ncharacter must make good those vows in her presence.\n\nShe, thus challenged, tried meanwhile to define her points. She wished\nto make Denham understand.\n\n\"Don t you see that if you have no relations with people it s easier to\nbe honest with them?\" she inquired. \"That is what I meant. One needn t\ncajole them; one s under no obligation to them. Surely you must have\nfound with your own family that it s impossible to discuss what matters\nto you most because you re all herded together, because you re in a\nconspiracy, because the position is false \" Her reasoning suspended\nitself a little inconclusively, for the subject was complex, and she\nfound herself in ignorance whether Denham had a family or not. Denham\nwas agreed with her as to the destructiveness of the family system, but\nhe did not wish to discuss the problem at that moment.\n\nHe turned to a problem which was of greater interest to him.\n\n\"I m convinced,\" he said, \"that there are cases in which perfect\nsincerity is possible cases where there s no relationship, though the\npeople live together, if you like, where each is free, where there s no\nobligation upon either side.\"\n\n\"For a time perhaps,\" she agreed, a little despondently. \"But\nobligations always grow up. There are feelings to be considered. People\naren t simple, and though they may mean to be reasonable, they end\" in\nthe condition in which she found herself, she meant, but added\nlamely \"in a muddle.\"\n\n\"Because,\" Denham instantly intervened, \"they don t make themselves\nunderstood at the beginning. I could undertake, at this instant,\" he\ncontinued, with a reasonable intonation which did much credit to his\nself-control, \"to lay down terms for a friendship which should be\nperfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward.\"\n\nShe was curious to hear them, but, besides feeling that the topic\nconcealed dangers better known to her than to him, she was reminded by\nhis tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the Embankment.\nAnything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her; it was as much\nan infliction to her as the rubbing of a skinless wound.\n\nBut he went on, without waiting for her invitation.\n\n\"In the first place, such a friendship must be unemotional,\" he laid it\ndown emphatically. \"At least, on both sides it must be understood that\nif either chooses to fall in love, he or she does so entirely at his\nown risk. Neither is under any obligation to the other. They must be at\nliberty to break or to alter at any moment. They must be able to say\nwhatever they wish to say. All this must be understood.\"\n\n\"And they gain something worth having?\" she asked.\n\n\"It s a risk of course it s a risk,\" he replied. The word\n\nwas one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with\nherself of late.\n\n\"But it s the only way if you think friendship worth having,\" he\nconcluded.\n\n\"Perhaps under those conditions it might be,\" she said reflectively.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"those are the terms of the friendship I wish to offer\nyou.\" She had known that this was coming, but, none the less, felt a\nlittle shock, half of pleasure, half of reluctance, when she heard the\nformal statement.\n\n\"I should like it,\" she began, \"but \"\n\n\"Would Rodney mind?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" she replied quickly.\n\n\"No, no, it isn t that,\" she went on, and again came to an end. She had\nbeen touched by the unreserved and yet ceremonious way in which he had\nmade what he called his offer of terms, but if he was generous it was\nthe more necessary for her to be cautious. They would find themselves\nin difficulties, she speculated; but, at this point, which was not very\nfar, after all, upon the road of caution, her foresight deserted her.\nShe sought for some definite catastrophe into which they must\ninevitably plunge. But she could think of none. It seemed to her that\nthese catastrophes were fictitious; life went on and on life was\ndifferent altogether from what people said. And not only was she at an\nend of her stock of caution, but it seemed suddenly altogether\nsuperfluous. Surely if any one could take care of himself, Ralph Denham\ncould; he had told her that he did not love her. And, further, she\nmeditated, walking on beneath the beech-trees and swinging her\numbrella, as in her thought she was accustomed to complete freedom, why\nshould she perpetually apply so different a standard to her behavior in\npractice? Why, she reflected, should there be this perpetual disparity\nbetween the thought and the action, between the life of solitude and\nthe life of society, this astonishing precipice on one side of which\nthe soul was active and in broad daylight, on the other side of which\nit was contemplative and dark as night? Was it not possible to step\nfrom one to the other, erect, and without essential change? Was this\nnot the chance he offered her the rare and wonderful chance of\nfriendship? At any rate, she told Denham, with a sigh in which he heard\nboth impatience and relief, that she agreed; she thought him right; she\nwould accept his terms of friendship.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"let s go and have tea.\"\n\nIn fact, these principles having been laid down, a great lightness of\nspirit showed itself in both of them. They were both convinced that\nsomething of profound importance had been settled, and could now give\ntheir attention to their tea and the Gardens. They wandered in and out\nof glass-houses, saw lilies swimming in tanks, breathed in the scent of\nthousands of carnations, and compared their respective tastes in the\nmatter of trees and lakes. While talking exclusively of what they saw,\nso that any one might have overheard them, they felt that the compact\nbetween them was made firmer and deeper by the number of people who\npassed them and suspected nothing of the kind. The question of Ralph s\ncottage and future was not mentioned again.\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVI\n\n\nAlthough the old coaches, with their gay panels and the guard s horn,\nand the humors of the box and the vicissitudes of the road, have long\nmoldered into dust so far as they were matter, and are preserved in the\nprinted pages of our novelists so far as they partook of the spirit, a\njourney to London by express train can still be a very pleasant and\nromantic adventure. Cassandra Otway, at the age of twenty-two, could\nimagine few things more pleasant. Satiated with months of green fields\nas she was, the first row of artisans  villas on the outskirts of\nLondon seemed to have something serious about it, which positively\nincreased the importance of every person in the railway carriage, and\neven, to her impressionable mind, quickened the speed of the train and\ngave a note of stern authority to the shriek of the engine-whistle.\nThey were bound for London; they must have precedence of all traffic\nnot similarly destined. A different demeanor was necessary directly one\nstepped out upon Liverpool Street platform, and became one of those\npreoccupied and hasty citizens for whose needs innumerable taxi-cabs,\nmotor-omnibuses, and underground railways were in waiting. She did her\nbest to look dignified and preoccupied too, but as the cab carried her\naway, with a determination which alarmed her a little, she became more\nand more forgetful of her station as a citizen of London, and turned\nher head from one window to another, picking up eagerly a building on\nthis side or a street scene on that to feed her intense curiosity. And\nyet, while the drive lasted no one was real, nothing was ordinary; the\ncrowds, the Government buildings, the tide of men and women washing the\nbase of the great glass windows, were all generalized, and affected her\nas if she saw them on the stage.\n\nAll these feelings were sustained and partly inspired by the fact that\nher journey took her straight to the center of her most romantic world.\nA thousand times in the midst of her pastoral landscape her thoughts\ntook this precise road, were admitted to the house in Chelsea, and went\ndirectly upstairs to Katharine s room, where, invisible themselves,\nthey had the better chance of feasting upon the privacy of the room s\nadorable and mysterious mistress. Cassandra adored her cousin; the\nadoration might have been foolish, but was saved from that excess and\nlent an engaging charm by the volatile nature of Cassandra s\ntemperament. She had adored a great many things and people in the\ncourse of twenty-two years; she had been alternately the pride and the\ndesperation of her teachers. She had worshipped architecture and music,\nnatural history and humanity, literature and art, but always at the\nheight of her enthusiasm, which was accompanied by a brilliant degree\nof accomplishment, she changed her mind and bought, surreptitiously,\nanother grammar. The terrible results which governesses had predicted\nfrom such mental dissipation were certainly apparent now that Cassandra\nwas twenty-two, and had never passed an examination, and daily showed\nherself less and less capable of passing one. The more serious\nprediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also\nverified. But from all these short strands of different accomplishments\nCassandra wove for herself an attitude, a cast of mind, which, if\nuseless, was found by some people to have the not despicable virtues of\nvivacity and freshness. Katharine, for example, thought her a most\ncharming companion. The cousins seemed to assemble between them a great\nrange of qualities which are never found united in one person and\nseldom in half a dozen people. Where Katharine was simple, Cassandra\nwas complex; where Katharine was solid and direct, Cassandra was vague\nand evasive. In short, they represented very well the manly and the\nwomanly sides of the feminine nature, and, for foundation, there was\nthe profound unity of common blood between them. If Cassandra adored\nKatharine she was incapable of adoring any one without refreshing her\nspirit with frequent draughts of raillery and criticism, and Katharine\nenjoyed her laughter at least as much as her respect.\n\nRespect was certainly uppermost in Cassandra s mind at the present\nmoment. Katharine s engagement had appealed to her imagination as the\nfirst engagement in a circle of contemporaries is apt to appeal to the\nimaginations of the others; it was solemn, beautiful, and mysterious;\nit gave both parties the important air of those who have been initiated\ninto some rite which is still concealed from the rest of the group. For\nKatharine s sake Cassandra thought William a most distinguished and\ninteresting character, and welcomed first his conversation and then his\nmanuscript as the marks of a friendship which it flattered and\ndelighted her to inspire.\n\nKatharine was still out when she arrived at Cheyne Walk. After greeting\nher uncle and aunt and receiving, as usual, a present of two sovereigns\nfor \"cab fares and dissipation\" from Uncle Trevor, whose favorite niece\nshe was, she changed her dress and wandered into Katharine s room to\nawait her. What a great looking-glass Katharine had, she thought, and\nhow mature all the arrangements upon the dressing-table were compared\nto what she was used to at home. Glancing round, she thought that the\nbills stuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece\nwere astonishingly like Katharine, There wasn t a photograph of William\nanywhere to be seen. The room, with its combination of luxury and\nbareness, its silk dressing-gowns and crimson slippers, its shabby\ncarpet and bare walls, had a powerful air of Katharine herself; she\nstood in the middle of the room and enjoyed the sensation; and then,\nwith a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering,\nCassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the\nshelf above the bed. In most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which\nthe last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if, late at\nnight, in the heart of privacy, people, skeptical by day, find solace\nin sipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or\nperplexities as may steal from their hiding-places in the dark. But\nthere was no hymn-book here. By their battered covers and enigmatical\ncontents, Cassandra judged them to be old school-books belonging to\nUncle Trevor, and piously, though eccentrically, preserved by his\ndaughter. There was no end, she thought, to the unexpectedness of\nKatharine. She had once had a passion for geometry herself, and, curled\nupon Katharine s quilt, she became absorbed in trying to remember how\nfar she had forgotten what she once knew. Katharine, coming in a little\nlater, found her deep in this characteristic pursuit.\n\n\"My dear,\" Cassandra exclaimed, shaking the book at her cousin, \"my\nwhole life s changed from this moment! I must write the man s name down\nat once, or I shall forget \"\n\nWhose name, what book, which life was changed Katharine proceeded to\nascertain. She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly, for she was\nvery late.\n\n\"May I sit and watch you?\" Cassandra asked, shutting up her book. \"I\ngot ready on purpose.\"\n\n\"Oh, you re ready, are you?\" said Katharine, half turning in the midst\nof her operations, and looking at Cassandra, who sat, clasping her\nknees, on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"There are people dining here,\" she said, taking in the effect of\nCassandra from a new point of view. After an interval, the distinction,\nthe irregular charm, of the small face with its long tapering nose and\nits bright oval eyes were very notable. The hair rose up off the\nforehead rather stiffly, and, given a more careful treatment by\nhairdressers and dressmakers, the light angular figure might possess a\nlikeness to a French lady of distinction in the eighteenth century.\n\n\"Who s coming to dinner?\" Cassandra asked, anticipating further\npossibilities of rapture.\n\n\"There s William, and, I believe, Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Aubrey.\"\n\n\"I m so glad William is coming. Did he tell you that he sent me his\nmanuscript? I think it s wonderful I think he s almost good enough for\nyou, Katharine.\"\n\n\"You shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him.\"\n\n\"I shan t dare do that,\" Cassandra asserted.\n\n\"Why? You re not afraid of him, are you?\"\n\n\"A little because he s connected with you.\"\n\nKatharine smiled.\n\n\"But then, with your well-known fidelity, considering that you re\nstaying here at least a fortnight, you won t have any illusions left\nabout me by the time you go. I give you a week, Cassandra. I shall see\nmy power fading day by day. Now it s at the climax; but to-morrow it ll\nhave begun to fade. What am I to wear, I wonder? Find me a blue dress,\nCassandra, over there in the long wardrobe.\"\n\nShe spoke disconnectedly, handling brush and comb, and pulling out the\nlittle drawers in her dressing-table and leaving them open. Cassandra,\nsitting on the bed behind her, saw the reflection of her cousin s face\nin the looking-glass. The face in the looking-glass was serious and\nintent, apparently occupied with other things besides the straightness\nof the parting which, however, was being driven as straight as a Roman\nroad through the dark hair. Cassandra was impressed again by\nKatharine s maturity; and, as she enveloped herself in the blue dress\nwhich filled almost the whole of the long looking-glass with blue light\nand made it the frame of a picture, holding not only the slightly\nmoving effigy of the beautiful woman, but shapes and colors of objects\nreflected from the background, Cassandra thought that no sight had ever\nbeen quite so romantic. It was all in keeping with the room and the\nhouse, and the city round them; for her ears had not yet ceased to\nnotice the hum of distant wheels.\n\nThey went downstairs rather late, in spite of Katharine s extreme speed\nin getting ready. To Cassandra s ears the buzz of voices inside the\ndrawing-room was like the tuning up of the instruments of the\norchestra. It seemed to her that there were numbers of people in the\nroom, and that they were strangers, and that they were beautiful and\ndressed with the greatest distinction, although they proved to be\nmostly her relations, and the distinction of their clothing was\nconfined, in the eyes of an impartial observer, to the white waistcoat\nwhich Rodney wore. But they all rose simultaneously, which was by\nitself impressive, and they all exclaimed, and shook hands, and she was\nintroduced to Mr. Peyton, and the door sprang open, and dinner was\nannounced, and they filed off, William Rodney offering her his slightly\nbent black arm, as she had secretly hoped he would. In short, had the\nscene been looked at only through her eyes, it must have been described\nas one of magical brilliancy. The pattern of the soup-plates, the stiff\nfolds of the napkins, which rose by the side of each plate in the shape\nof arum lilies, the long sticks of bread tied with pink ribbon, the\nsilver dishes and the sea-colored champagne glasses, with the flakes of\ngold congealed in their stems all these details, together with a\ncuriously pervasive smell of kid gloves, contributed to her\nexhilaration, which must be repressed, however, because she was grown\nup, and the world held no more for her to marvel at.\n\nThe world held no more for her to marvel at, it is true; but it held\nother people; and each other person possessed in Cassandra s mind some\nfragment of what privately she called \"reality.\" It was a gift that\nthey would impart if you asked them for it, and thus no dinner-party\ncould possibly be dull, and little Mr. Peyton on her right and William\nRodney on her left were in equal measure endowed with the quality which\nseemed to her so unmistakable and so precious that the way people\nneglected to demand it was a constant source of surprise to her. She\nscarcely knew, indeed, whether she was talking to Mr. Peyton or to\nWilliam Rodney. But to one who, by degrees, assumed the shape of an\nelderly man with a mustache, she described how she had arrived in\nLondon that very afternoon, and how she had taken a cab and driven\nthrough the streets. Mr. Peyton, an editor of fifty years, bowed his\nbald head repeatedly, with apparent understanding. At least, he\nunderstood that she was very young and pretty, and saw that she was\nexcited, though he could not gather at once from her words or remember\nfrom his own experience what there was to be excited about. \"Were there\nany buds on the trees?\" he asked. \"Which line did she travel by?\"\n\nHe was cut short in these amiable inquiries by her desire to know\nwhether he was one of those who read, or one of those who look out of\nthe window? Mr. Peyton was by no means sure which he did. He rather\nthought he did both. He was told that he had made a most dangerous\nconfession. She could deduce his entire history from that one fact. He\nchallenged her to proceed; and she proclaimed him a Liberal Member of\nParliament.\n\nWilliam, nominally engaged in a desultory conversation with Aunt\nEleanor, heard every word, and taking advantage of the fact that\nelderly ladies have little continuity of conversation, at least with\nthose whom they esteem for their youth and their sex, he asserted his\npresence by a very nervous laugh.\n\nCassandra turned to him directly. She was enchanted to find that,\ninstantly and with such ease, another of these fascinating beings was\noffering untold wealth for her extraction.\n\n\"There s no doubt what _you_ do in a railway carriage, William,\" she\nsaid, making use in her pleasure of his first name. \"You never _once_\nlook out of the window; you read _all_ the time.\"\n\n\"And what facts do you deduce from that?\" Mr. Peyton asked.\n\n\"Oh, that he s a poet, of course,\" said Cassandra. \"But I must confess\nthat I knew that before, so it isn t fair. I ve got your manuscript\nwith me,\" she went on, disregarding Mr. Peyton in a shameless way.\n\"I ve got all sorts of things I want to ask you about it.\"\n\nWilliam inclined his head and tried to conceal the pleasure that her\nremark gave him. But the pleasure was not unalloyed. However\nsusceptible to flattery William might be, he would never tolerate it\nfrom people who showed a gross or emotional taste in literature, and if\nCassandra erred even slightly from what he considered essential in this\nrespect he would express his discomfort by flinging out his hands and\nwrinkling his forehead; he would find no pleasure in her flattery after\nthat.\n\n\"First of all,\" she proceeded, \"I want to know why you chose to write a\nplay?\"\n\n\"Ah! You mean it s not dramatic?\"\n\n\"I mean that I don t see what it would gain by being acted. But then\ndoes Shakespeare gain? Henry and I are always arguing about\nShakespeare. I m certain he s wrong, but I can t prove it because I ve\nonly seen Shakespeare acted once in Lincoln. But I m quite positive,\"\nshe insisted, \"that Shakespeare wrote for the stage.\"\n\n\"You re perfectly right,\" Rodney exclaimed. \"I was hoping you were on\nthat side. Henry s wrong entirely wrong. Of course, I ve failed, as all\nthe moderns fail. Dear, dear, I wish I d consulted you before.\"\n\nFrom this point they proceeded to go over, as far as memory served\nthem, the different aspects of Rodney s drama. She said nothing that\njarred upon him, and untrained daring had the power to stimulate\nexperience to such an extent that Rodney was frequently seen to hold\nhis fork suspended before him, while he debated the first principles of\nthe art. Mrs. Hilbery thought to herself that she had never seen him to\nsuch advantage; yes, he was somehow different; he reminded her of some\none who was dead, some one who was distinguished she had forgotten his\nname.\n\nCassandra s voice rose high in its excitement.\n\n\"You ve not read  The Idiot !\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"I ve read  War and Peace ,\" William replied, a little testily.\n\n\"_War and Peace_!\" she echoed, in a tone of derision.\n\n\"I confess I don t understand the Russians.\"\n\n\"Shake hands! Shake hands!\" boomed Uncle Aubrey from across the table.\n\"Neither do I. And I hazard the opinion that they don t themselves.\"\n\nThe old gentleman had ruled a large part of the Indian Empire, but he\nwas in the habit of saying that he had rather have written the works of\nDickens. The table now took possession of a subject much to its liking.\nAunt Eleanor showed premonitory signs of pronouncing an opinion.\nAlthough she had blunted her taste upon some form of philanthropy for\ntwenty-five years, she had a fine natural instinct for an upstart or a\npretender, and knew to a hairbreadth what literature should be and what\nit should not be. She was born to the knowledge, and scarcely thought\nit a matter to be proud of.\n\n\"Insanity is not a fit subject for fiction,\" she announced positively.\n\n\"There s the well-known case of Hamlet,\" Mr. Hilbery interposed, in his\nleisurely, half-humorous tones.\n\n\"Ah, but poetry s different, Trevor,\" said Aunt Eleanor, as if she had\nspecial authority from Shakespeare to say so. \"Different altogether.\nAnd I ve never thought, for my part, that Hamlet was as mad as they\nmake out. What is your opinion, Mr. Peyton?\" For, as there was a\nminister of literature present in the person of the editor of an\nesteemed review, she deferred to him.\n\nMr. Peyton leant a little back in his chair, and, putting his head\nrather on one side, observed that that was a question that he had never\nbeen able to answer entirely to his satisfaction. There was much to be\nsaid on both sides, but as he considered upon which side he should say\nit, Mrs. Hilbery broke in upon his judicious meditations.\n\n\"Lovely, lovely Ophelia!\" she exclaimed. \"What a wonderful power it\nis poetry! I wake up in the morning all bedraggled; there s a yellow\nfog outside; little Emily turns on the electric light when she brings\nme my tea, and says,  Oh, ma am, the water s frozen in the cistern, and\ncook s cut her finger to the bone.  And then I open a little green\nbook, and the birds are singing, the stars shining, the flowers\ntwinkling \" She looked about her as if these presences had suddenly\nmanifested themselves round her dining-room table.\n\n\"Has the cook cut her finger badly?\" Aunt Eleanor demanded, addressing\nherself naturally to Katharine.\n\n\"Oh, the cook s finger is only my way of putting it,\" said Mrs.\nHilbery. \"But if she had cut her arm off, Katharine would have sewn it\non again,\" she remarked, with an affectionate glance at her daughter,\nwho looked, she thought, a little sad. \"But what horrid, horrid\nthoughts,\" she wound up, laying down her napkin and pushing her chair\nback. \"Come, let us find something more cheerful to talk about\nupstairs.\"\n\nUpstairs in the drawing-room Cassandra found fresh sources of pleasure,\nfirst in the distinguished and expectant look of the room, and then in\nthe chance of exercising her divining-rod upon a new assortment of\nhuman beings. But the low tones of the women, their meditative\nsilences, the beauty which, to her at least, shone even from black\nsatin and the knobs of amber which encircled elderly necks, changed her\nwish to chatter to a more subdued desire merely to watch and to\nwhisper. She entered with delight into an atmosphere in which private\nmatters were being interchanged freely, almost in monosyllables, by the\nolder women who now accepted her as one of themselves. Her expression\nbecame very gentle and sympathetic, as if she, too, were full of\nsolicitude for the world which was somehow being cared for, managed and\ndeprecated by Aunt Maggie and Aunt Eleanor. After a time she perceived\nthat Katharine was outside the community in some way, and, suddenly,\nshe threw aside her wisdom and gentleness and concern and began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" Katharine asked.\n\nA joke so foolish and unfilial wasn t worth explaining.\n\n\"It was nothing ridiculous in the worst of taste, but still, if you\nhalf shut your eyes and looked \" Katharine half shut her eyes and\nlooked, but she looked in the wrong direction, and Cassandra laughed\nmore than ever, and was still laughing and doing her best to explain in\na whisper that Aunt Eleanor, through half-shut eyes, was like the\nparrot in the cage at Stogdon House, when the gentlemen came in and\nRodney walked straight up to them and wanted to know what they were\nlaughing at.\n\n\"I utterly refuse to tell you!\" Cassandra replied, standing up\nstraight, clasping her hands in front of her, and facing him. Her\nmockery was delicious to him. He had not even for a second the fear\nthat she had been laughing at him. She was laughing because life was so\nadorable, so enchanting.\n\n\"Ah, but you re cruel to make me feel the barbarity of my sex,\" he\nreplied, drawing his feet together and pressing his finger-tips upon an\nimaginary opera-hat or malacca cane. \"We ve been discussing all sorts\nof dull things, and now I shall never know what I want to know more\nthan anything in the world.\"\n\n\"You don t deceive us for a minute!\" she cried. \"Not for a second. We\nboth know that you ve been enjoying yourself immensely. Hasn t he,\nKatharine?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, \"I think he s speaking the truth. He doesn t care\nmuch for politics.\"\n\nHer words, though spoken simply, produced a curious change in the\nlight, sparkling atmosphere. William at once lost his look of animation\nand said seriously:\n\n\"I detest politics.\"\n\n\"I don t think any man has the right to say that,\" said Cassandra,\nalmost severely.\n\n\"I agree. I mean that I detest politicians,\" he corrected himself\nquickly.\n\n\"You see, I believe Cassandra is what they call a Feminist,\" Katharine\nwent on. \"Or rather, she was a Feminist six months ago, but it s no\ngood supposing that she is now what she was then. That is one of her\ngreatest charms in my eyes. One never can tell.\" She smiled at her as\nan elder sister might smile.\n\n\"Katharine, you make one feel so horribly small!\" Cassandra exclaimed.\n\n\"No, no, that s not what she means,\" Rodney interposed. \"I quite agree\nthat women have an immense advantage over us there. One misses a lot by\nattempting to know things thoroughly.\"\n\n\"He knows Greek thoroughly,\" said Katharine. \"But then he also knows a\ngood deal about painting, and a certain amount about music. He s very\ncultivated perhaps the most cultivated person I know.\"\n\n\"And poetry,\" Cassandra added.\n\n\"Yes, I was forgetting his play,\" Katharine remarked, and turning her\nhead as though she saw something that needed her attention in a far\ncorner of the room, she left them.\n\nFor a moment they stood silent, after what seemed a deliberate\nintroduction to each other, and Cassandra watched her crossing the\nroom.\n\n\"Henry,\" she said next moment, \"would say that a stage ought to be no\nbigger than this drawing-room. He wants there to be singing and dancing\nas well as acting only all the opposite of Wagner you understand?\"\n\nThey sat down, and Katharine, turning when she reached the window, saw\nWilliam with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open, as if\nready to speak the moment Cassandra ceased.\n\nKatharine s duty, whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair, was\neither forgotten or discharged, but she continued to stand by the\nwindow without doing anything. The elderly people were all grouped\ntogether round the fire. They seemed an independent, middle-aged\ncommunity busy with its own concerns. They were telling stories very\nwell and listening to them very graciously. But for her there was no\nobvious employment.\n\n\"If anybody says anything, I shall say that I m looking at the river,\"\nshe thought, for in her slavery to her family traditions, she was ready\nto pay for her transgression with some plausible falsehood. She pushed\naside the blind and looked at the river. But it was a dark night and\nthe water was barely visible. Cabs were passing, and couples were\nloitering slowly along the road, keeping as close to the railings as\npossible, though the trees had as yet no leaves to cast shadow upon\ntheir embraces. Katharine, thus withdrawn, felt her loneliness. The\nevening had been one of pain, offering her, minute after minute,\nplainer proof that things would fall out as she had foreseen. She had\nfaced tones, gestures, glances; she knew, with her back to them, that\nWilliam, even now, was plunging deeper and deeper into the delight of\nunexpected understanding with Cassandra. He had almost told her that he\nwas finding it infinitely better than he could have believed. She\nlooked out of the window, sternly determined to forget private\nmisfortunes, to forget herself, to forget individual lives. With her\neyes upon the dark sky, voices reached her from the room in which she\nwas standing. She heard them as if they came from people in another\nworld, a world antecedent to her world, a world that was the prelude,\nthe antechamber to reality; it was as if, lately dead, she heard the\nliving talking. The dream nature of our life had never been more\napparent to her, never had life been more certainly an affair of four\nwalls, whose objects existed only within the range of lights and fires,\nbeyond which lay nothing, or nothing more than darkness. She seemed\nphysically to have stepped beyond the region where the light of\nillusion still makes it desirable to possess, to love, to struggle. And\nyet her melancholy brought her no serenity. She still heard the voices\nwithin the room. She was still tormented by desires. She wished to be\nbeyond their range. She wished inconsistently enough that she could\nfind herself driving rapidly through the streets; she was even anxious\nto be with some one who, after a moment s groping, took a definite\nshape and solidified into the person of Mary Datchet. She drew the\ncurtains so that the draperies met in deep folds in the middle of the\nwindow.\n\n\"Ah, there she is,\" said Mr. Hilbery, who was standing swaying affably\nfrom side to side, with his back to the fire. \"Come here, Katharine. I\ncouldn t see where you d got to our children,\" he observed\nparenthetically, \"have their uses I want you to go to my study,\nKatharine; go to the third shelf on the right-hand side of the door;\ntake down  Trelawny s Recollections of Shelley ; bring it to me. Then,\nPeyton, you will have to admit to the assembled company that you have\nbeen mistaken.\"\n\n\" Trelawny s Recollections of Shelley.  The third shelf on the right of\nthe door,\" Katharine repeated. After all, one does not check children\nin their play, or rouse sleepers from their dreams. She passed William\nand Cassandra on her way to the door.\n\n\"Stop, Katharine,\" said William, speaking almost as if he were\nconscious of her against his will. \"Let me go.\" He rose, after a\nsecond s hesitation, and she understood that it cost him an effort. She\nknelt one knee upon the sofa where Cassandra sat, looking down at her\ncousin s face, which still moved with the speed of what she had been\nsaying.\n\n\"Are you happy?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" Cassandra exclaimed, as if no further words were needed.\n\"Of course, we disagree about every subject under the sun,\" she\nexclaimed, \"but I think he s the cleverest man I ve ever met and you re\nthe most beautiful woman,\" she added, looking at Katharine, and as she\nlooked her face lost its animation and became almost melancholy in\nsympathy with Katharine s melancholy, which seemed to Cassandra the\nlast refinement of her distinction.\n\n\"Ah, but it s only ten o clock,\" said Katharine darkly.\n\n\"As late as that! Well ?\" She did not understand.\n\n\"At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go. The illusion fades.\nBut I accept my fate. I make hay while the sun shines.\" Cassandra\nlooked at her with a puzzled expression.\n\n\"Here s Katharine talking about rats, and hay, and all sorts of odd\nthings,\" she said, as William returned to them. He had been quick. \"Can\nyou make her out?\"\n\nKatharine perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did\nnot find that particular problem to his taste at present. She stood\nupright at once and said in a different tone:\n\n\"I really am off, though. I wish you d explain if they say anything,\nWilliam. I shan t be late, but I ve got to see some one.\"\n\n\"At this time of night?\" Cassandra exclaimed.\n\n\"Whom have you got to see?\" William demanded.\n\n\"A friend,\" she remarked, half turning her head towards him. She knew\nthat he wished her to stay, not, indeed, with them, but in their\nneighborhood, in case of need.\n\n\"Katharine has a great many friends,\" said William rather lamely,\nsitting down once more, as Katharine left the room.\n\nShe was soon driving quickly, as she had wished to drive, through the\nlamp-lit streets. She liked both light and speed, and the sense of\nbeing out of doors alone, and the knowledge that she would reach Mary\nin her high, lonely room at the end of the drive. She climbed the stone\nsteps quickly, remarking the queer look of her blue silk skirt and blue\nshoes upon the stone, dusty with the boots of the day, under the light\nof an occasional jet of flickering gas.\n\nThe door was opened in a second by Mary herself, whose face showed not\nonly surprise at the sight of her visitor, but some degree of\nembarrassment. She greeted her cordially, and, as there was no time for\nexplanations, Katharine walked straight into the sitting-room, and\nfound herself in the presence of a young man who was lying back in a\nchair and holding a sheet of paper in his hand, at which he was looking\nas if he expected to go on immediately with what he was in the middle\nof saying to Mary Datchet. The apparition of an unknown lady in full\nevening dress seemed to disturb him. He took his pipe from his mouth,\nrose stiffly, and sat down again with a jerk.\n\n\"Have you been dining out?\" Mary asked.\n\n\"Are you working?\" Katharine inquired simultaneously.\n\nThe young man shook his head, as if he disowned his share in the\nquestion with some irritation.\n\n\"Well, not exactly,\" Mary replied. \"Mr. Basnett had brought some papers\nto show me. We were going through them, but we d almost done.... Tell\nus about your party.\"\n\nMary had a ruffled appearance, as if she had been running her fingers\nthrough her hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed\nmore or less like a Russian peasant girl. She sat down again in a chair\nwhich looked as if it had been her seat for some hours; the saucer\nwhich stood upon the arm contained the ashes of many cigarettes. Mr.\nBasnett, a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead\nfrom which the hair was combed straight back, was one of that group of\n\"very able young men\" suspected by Mr. Clacton, justly as it turned\nout, of an influence upon Mary Datchet. He had come down from one of\nthe Universities not long ago, and was now charged with the reformation\nof society. In connection with the rest of the group of very able young\nmen he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the\namalgamation of the middle class and the working class, and for a joint\nassault of the two bodies, combined in the Society for the Education of\nDemocracy, upon Capital. The scheme had already reached the stage in\nwhich it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and\nhe had been deputed to expound the scheme to Mary, and make her an\noffer of the Secretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small\nsalary was attached. Since seven o clock that evening he had been\nreading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers\nwas expounded, but the reading was so frequently interrupted by\ndiscussion, and it was so often necessary to inform Mary \"in strictest\nconfidence\" of the private characters and evil designs of certain\nindividuals and societies that they were still only half-way through\nthe manuscript. Neither of them realized that the talk had already\nlasted three hours. In their absorption they had forgotten even to feed\nthe fire, and yet both Mr. Basnett in his exposition, and Mary in her\ninterrogation, carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to\ncheck the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion. Her\nquestions frequently began, \"Am I to understand \" and his replies\ninvariably represented the views of some one called \"we.\"\n\nBy this time Mary was almost persuaded that she, too, was included in\nthe \"we,\" and agreed with Mr. Basnett in believing that \"our\" views,\n\"our\" society, \"our\" policy, stood for something quite definitely\nsegregated from the main body of society in a circle of superior\nillumination.\n\nThe appearance of Katharine in this atmosphere was extremely\nincongruous, and had the effect of making Mary remember all sorts of\nthings that she had been glad to forget.\n\n\"You ve been dining out?\" she asked again, looking, with a little\nsmile, at the blue silk and the pearl-sewn shoes.\n\n\"No, at home. Are you starting something new?\" Katharine hazarded,\nrather hesitatingly, looking at the papers.\n\n\"We are,\" Mr. Basnett replied. He said no more.\n\n\"I m thinking of leaving our friends in Russell Square,\" Mary\nexplained.\n\n\"I see. And then you will do something else.\"\n\n\"Well, I m afraid I like working,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Afraid,\" said Mr. Basnett, conveying the impression that, in his\nopinion, no sensible person could be afraid of liking to work.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine, as if he had stated this opinion aloud. \"I\nshould like to start something something off one s own bat that s what\nI should like.\"\n\n\"Yes, that s the fun,\" said Mr. Basnett, looking at her for the first\ntime rather keenly, and refilling his pipe.\n\n\"But you can t limit work that s what I mean,\" said Mary. \"I mean there\nare other sorts of work. No one works harder than a woman with little\nchildren.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Mr. Basnett. \"It s precisely the women with babies we\nwant to get hold of.\" He glanced at his document, rolled it into a\ncylinder between his fingers, and gazed into the fire. Katharine felt\nthat in this company anything that one said would be judged upon its\nmerits; one had only to say what one thought, rather barely and\ntersely, with a curious assumption that the number of things that could\nproperly be thought about was strictly limited. And Mr. Basnett was\nonly stiff upon the surface; there was an intelligence in his face\nwhich attracted her intelligence.\n\n\"When will the public know?\" she asked.\n\n\"What d you mean about us?\" Mr. Basnett asked, with a little smile.\n\n\"That depends upon many things,\" said Mary. The conspirators looked\npleased, as if Katharine s question, with the belief in their existence\nwhich it implied, had a warming effect upon them.\n\n\"In starting a society such as we wish to start (we can t say any more\nat present),\" Mr. Basnett began, with a little jerk of his head, \"there\nare two things to remember the Press and the public. Other societies,\nwhich shall be nameless, have gone under because they ve appealed only\nto cranks. If you don t want a mutual admiration society, which dies as\nsoon as you ve all discovered each other s faults, you must nobble the\nPress. You must appeal to the public.\"\n\n\"That s the difficulty,\" said Mary thoughtfully.\n\n\"That s where she comes in,\" said Mr. Basnett, jerking his head in\nMary s direction. \"She s the only one of us who s a capitalist. She can\nmake a whole-time job of it. I m tied to an office; I can only give my\nspare time. Are you, by any chance, on the look-out for a job?\" he\nasked Katharine, with a queer mixture of distrust and deference.\n\n\"Marriage is her job at present,\" Mary replied for her.\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Mr. Basnett. He made allowances for that; he and his\nfriends had faced the question of sex, along with all others, and\nassigned it an honorable place in their scheme of life. Katharine felt\nthis beneath the roughness of his manner; and a world entrusted to the\nguardianship of Mary Datchet and Mr. Basnett seemed to her a good\nworld, although not a romantic or beautiful place or, to put it\nfiguratively, a place where any line of blue mist softly linked tree to\ntree upon the horizon. For a moment she thought she saw in his face,\nbent now over the fire, the features of that original man whom we still\nrecall every now and then, although we know only the clerk, barrister,\nGovernmental official, or workingman variety of him. Not that Mr.\nBasnett, giving his days to commerce and his spare time to social\nreform, would long carry about him any trace of his possibilities of\ncompleteness; but, for the moment, in his youth and ardor, still\nspeculative, still uncramped, one might imagine him the citizen of a\nnobler state than ours. Katharine turned over her small stock of\ninformation, and wondered what their society might be going to attempt.\nThen she remembered that she was hindering their business, and rose,\nstill thinking of this society, and thus thinking, she said to Mr.\nBasnett:\n\n\"Well, you ll ask me to join when the time comes, I hope.\"\n\nHe nodded, and took his pipe from his mouth, but, being unable to think\nof anything to say, he put it back again, although he would have been\nglad if she had stayed.\n\nAgainst her wish, Mary insisted upon taking her downstairs, and then,\nas there was no cab to be seen, they stood in the street together,\nlooking about them.\n\n\"Go back,\" Katharine urged her, thinking of Mr. Basnett with his papers\nin his hand.\n\n\"You can t wander about the streets alone in those clothes,\" said Mary,\nbut the desire to find a cab was not her true reason for standing\nbeside Katharine for a minute or two. Unfortunately for her composure,\nMr. Basnett and his papers seemed to her an incidental diversion of\nlife s serious purpose compared with some tremendous fact which\nmanifested itself as she stood alone with Katharine. It may have been\ntheir common womanhood.\n\n\"Have you seen Ralph?\" she asked suddenly, without preface.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine directly, but she did not remember when or where\nshe had seen him. It took her a moment or two to remember why Mary\nshould ask her if she had seen Ralph.\n\n\"I believe I m jealous,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Nonsense, Mary,\" said Katharine, rather distractedly, taking her arm\nand beginning to walk up the street in the direction of the main road.\n\"Let me see; we went to Kew, and we agreed to be friends. Yes, that s\nwhat happened.\" Mary was silent, in the hope that Katharine would tell\nher more. But Katharine said nothing.\n\n\"It s not a question of friendship,\" Mary exclaimed, her anger rising,\nto her own surprise. \"You know it s not. How can it be? I ve no right\nto interfere \" She stopped. \"Only I d rather Ralph wasn t hurt,\" she\nconcluded.\n\n\"I think he seems able to take care of himself,\" Katharine observed.\nWithout either of them wishing it, a feeling of hostility had risen\nbetween them.\n\n\"Do you really think it s worth it?\" said Mary, after a pause.\n\n\"How can one tell?\" Katharine asked.\n\n\"Have you ever cared for any one?\" Mary demanded rashly and foolishly.\n\n\"I can t wander about London discussing my feelings Here s a cab no,\nthere s some one in it.\"\n\n\"We don t want to quarrel,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Ought I to have told him that I wouldn t be his friend?\" Katharine\nasked. \"Shall I tell him that? If so, what reason shall I give him?\"\n\n\"Of course you can t tell him that,\" said Mary, controlling herself.\n\n\"I believe I shall, though,\" said Katharine suddenly.\n\n\"I lost my temper, Katharine; I shouldn t have said what I did.\"\n\n\"The whole thing s foolish,\" said Katharine, peremptorily. \"That s what\nI say. It s not worth it.\" She spoke with unnecessary vehemence, but it\nwas not directed against Mary Datchet. Their animosity had completely\ndisappeared, and upon both of them a cloud of difficulty and darkness\nrested, obscuring the future, in which they had both to find a way.\n\n\"No, no, it s not worth it,\" Katharine repeated. \"Suppose, as you say,\nit s out of the question this friendship; he falls in love with me. I\ndon t want that. Still,\" she added, \"I believe you exaggerate; love s\nnot everything; marriage itself is only one of the things \" They had\nreached the main thoroughfare, and stood looking at the omnibuses and\npassers-by, who seemed, for the moment, to illustrate what Katharine\nhad said of the diversity of human interests. For both of them it had\nbecome one of those moments of extreme detachment, when it seems\nunnecessary ever again to shoulder the burden of happiness and\nself-assertive existence. Their neighbors were welcome to their\npossessions.\n\n\"I don t lay down any rules,\"  said Mary, recovering herself first, as\nthey turned after a long pause of this description. \"All I say is that\nyou should know what you re about for certain; but,\" she added, \"I\nexpect you do.\"\n\nAt the same time she was profoundly perplexed, not only by what she\nknew of the arrangements for Katharine s marriage, but by the\nimpression which she had of her, there on her arm, dark and\ninscrutable.\n\nThey walked back again and reached the steps which led up to Mary s\nflat. Here they stopped and paused for a moment, saying nothing.\n\n\"You must go in,\" said Katharine, rousing herself. \"He s waiting all\nthis time to go on with his reading.\" She glanced up at the lighted\nwindow near the top of the house, and they both looked at it and waited\nfor a moment. A flight of semicircular steps ran up to the hall, and\nMary slowly mounted the first two or three, and paused, looking down\nupon Katharine.\n\n\"I think you underrate the value of that emotion,\" she said slowly, and\na little awkwardly. She climbed another step and looked down once more\nupon the figure that was only partly lit up, standing in the street\nwith a colorless face turned upwards. As Mary hesitated, a cab came by\nand Katharine turned and stopped it, saying as she opened the door:\n\n\"Remember, I want to belong to your society remember,\" she added,\nhaving to raise her voice a little, and shutting the door upon the rest\nof her words.\n\nMary mounted the stairs step by step, as if she had to lift her body up\nan extremely steep ascent. She had had to wrench herself forcibly away\nfrom Katharine, and every step vanquished her desire. She held on\ngrimly, encouraging herself as though she were actually making some\ngreat physical effort in climbing a height. She was conscious that Mr.\nBasnett, sitting at the top of the stairs with his documents, offered\nher solid footing if she were capable of reaching it. The knowledge\ngave her a faint sense of exaltation.\n\nMr. Basnett raised his eyes as she opened the door.\n\n\"I ll go on where I left off,\" he said. \"Stop me if you want anything\nexplained.\"\n\nHe had been re-reading the document, and making pencil notes in the\nmargin while he waited, and he went on again as if there had been no\ninterruption. Mary sat down among the flat cushions, lit another\ncigarette, and listened with a frown upon her face.\n\nKatharine leant back in the corner of the cab that carried her to\nChelsea, conscious of fatigue, and conscious, too, of the sober and\nsatisfactory nature of such industry as she had just witnessed. The\nthought of it composed and calmed her. When she reached home she let\nherself in as quietly as she could, in the hope that the household was\nalready gone to bed. But her excursion had occupied less time than she\nthought, and she heard sounds of unmistakable liveliness upstairs. A\ndoor opened, and she drew herself into a ground-floor room in case the\nsound meant that Mr. Peyton were taking his leave. From where she stood\nshe could see the stairs, though she was herself invisible. Some one\nwas coming down the stairs, and now she saw that it was William Rodney.\nHe looked a little strange, as if he were walking in his sleep; his\nlips moved as if he were acting some part to himself. He came down very\nslowly, step by step, with one hand upon the banisters to guide\nhimself. She thought he looked as if he were in some mood of high\nexaltation, which it made her uncomfortable to witness any longer\nunseen. She stepped into the hall. He gave a great start upon seeing\nher and stopped.\n\n\"Katharine!\" he exclaimed. \"You ve been out?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.... Are they still up?\"\n\nHe did not answer, and walked into the ground-floor room through the\ndoor which stood open.\n\n\"It s been more wonderful than I can tell you,\" he said, \"I m\nincredibly happy \"\n\nHe was scarcely addressing her, and she said nothing. For a moment they\nstood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. Then he asked her\nquickly, \"But tell me, how did it seem to you? What did you think,\nKatharine? Is there a chance that she likes me? Tell me, Katharine!\"\n\nBefore she could answer a door opened on the landing above and\ndisturbed them. It disturbed William excessively. He started back,\nwalked rapidly into the hall, and said in a loud and ostentatiously\nordinary tone:\n\n\"Good night, Katharine. Go to bed now. I shall see you soon. I hope I\nshall be able to come to-morrow.\"\n\nNext moment he was gone. She went upstairs and found Cassandra on the\nlanding. She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping\nto look at others in a little bookcase. She said that she could never\ntell which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or\nmetaphysics.\n\n\"What do you read in bed, Katharine?\" she asked, as they walked\nupstairs side by side.\n\n\"Sometimes one thing sometimes another,\" said Katharine vaguely.\nCassandra looked at her.\n\n\"D you know, you re extraordinarily queer,\" she said. \"Every one seems\nto me a little queer. Perhaps it s the effect of London.\"\n\n\"Is William queer, too?\" Katharine asked.\n\n\"Well, I think he is a little,\" Cassandra replied. \"Queer, but very\nfascinating. I shall read Milton to-night. It s been one of the\nhappiest nights of my life, Katharine,\" she added, looking with shy\ndevotion at her cousin s beautiful face.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVII\n\n\nLondon, in the first days of spring, has buds that open and flowers\nthat suddenly shake their petals white, purple, or crimson in\ncompetition with the display in the garden beds, although these city\nflowers are merely so many doors flung wide in Bond Street and the\nneighborhood, inviting you to look at a picture, or hear a symphony, or\nmerely crowd and crush yourself among all sorts of vocal, excitable,\nbrightly colored human beings. But, all the same, it is no mean rival\nto the quieter process of vegetable florescence. Whether or not there\nis a generous motive at the root, a desire to share and impart, or\nwhether the animation is purely that of insensate fervor and friction,\nthe effect, while it lasts, certainly encourages those who are young,\nand those who are ignorant, to think the world one great bazaar, with\nbanners fluttering and divans heaped with spoils from every quarter of\nthe globe for their delight.\n\nAs Cassandra Otway went about London provided with shillings that\nopened turnstiles, or more often with large white cards that\ndisregarded turnstiles, the city seemed to her the most lavish and\nhospitable of hosts. After visiting the National Gallery, or Hertford\nHouse, or hearing Brahms or Beethoven at the Bechstein Hall, she would\ncome back to find a new person awaiting her, in whose soul were\nimbedded some grains of the invaluable substance which she still called\nreality, and still believed that she could find. The Hilberys, as the\nsaying is, \"knew every one,\" and that arrogant claim was certainly\nupheld by the number of houses which, within a certain area, lit their\nlamps at night, opened their doors after 3 p. m., and admitted the\nHilberys to their dining-rooms, say, once a month. An indefinable\nfreedom and authority of manner, shared by most of the people who lived\nin these houses, seemed to indicate that whether it was a question of\nart, music, or government, they were well within the gates, and could\nsmile indulgently at the vast mass of humanity which is forced to wait\nand struggle, and pay for entrance with common coin at the door. The\ngates opened instantly to admit Cassandra. She was naturally critical\nof what went on inside, and inclined to quote what Henry would have\nsaid; but she often succeeded in contradicting Henry, in his absence,\nand invariably paid her partner at dinner, or the kind old lady who\nremembered her grandmother, the compliment of believing that there was\nmeaning in what they said. For the sake of the light in her eager eyes,\nmuch crudity of expression and some untidiness of person were forgiven\nher. It was generally felt that, given a year or two of experience,\nintroduced to good dressmakers, and preserved from bad influences, she\nwould be an acquisition. Those elderly ladies, who sit on the edge of\nballrooms sampling the stuff of humanity between finger and thumb and\nbreathing so evenly that the necklaces, which rise and fall upon their\nbreasts, seem to represent some elemental force, such as the waves upon\nthe ocean of humanity, concluded, a little smilingly, that she would\ndo. They meant that she would in all probability marry some young man\nwhose mother they respected.\n\nWilliam Rodney was fertile in suggestions. He knew of little galleries,\nand select concerts, and private performances, and somehow made time to\nmeet Katharine and Cassandra, and to give them tea or dinner or supper\nin his rooms afterwards. Each one of her fourteen days thus promised to\nbear some bright illumination in its sober text. But Sunday approached.\nThe day is usually dedicated to Nature. The weather was almost kindly\nenough for an expedition. But Cassandra rejected Hampton Court,\nGreenwich, Richmond, and Kew in favor of the Zoological Gardens. She\nhad once trifled with the psychology of animals, and still knew\nsomething about inherited characteristics. On Sunday afternoon,\ntherefore, Katharine, Cassandra, and William Rodney drove off to the\nZoo. As their cab approached the entrance, Katharine bent forward and\nwaved her hand to a young man who was walking rapidly in the same\ndirection.\n\n\"There s Ralph Denham!\" she exclaimed. \"I told him to meet us here,\"\nshe added. She had even come provided with a ticket for him. William s\nobjection that he would not be admitted was, therefore, silenced\ndirectly. But the way in which the two men greeted each other was\nsignificant of what was going to happen. As soon as they had admired\nthe little birds in the large cage William and Cassandra lagged behind,\nand Ralph and Katharine pressed on rather in advance. It was an\narrangement in which William took his part, and one that suited his\nconvenience, but he was annoyed all the same. He thought that Katharine\nshould have told him that she had invited Denham to meet them.\n\n\"One of Katharine s friends,\" he said rather sharply. It was clear that\nhe was irritated, and Cassandra felt for his annoyance. They were\nstanding by the pen of some Oriental hog, and she was prodding the\nbrute gently with the point of her umbrella, when a thousand little\nobservations seemed, in some way, to collect in one center. The center\nwas one of intense and curious emotion. Were they happy? She dismissed\nthe question as she asked it, scorning herself for applying such simple\nmeasures to the rare and splendid emotions of so unique a couple.\nNevertheless, her manner became immediately different, as if, for the\nfirst time, she felt consciously womanly, and as if William might\nconceivably wish later on to confide in her. She forgot all about the\npsychology of animals, and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown, and\nbecame instantly engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could\nadminister consolation, and she hoped that Katharine would keep ahead\nwith Mr. Denham, as a child who plays at being grown-up hopes that her\nmother won t come in just yet, and spoil the game. Or was it not rather\nthat she had ceased to play at being grown-up, and was conscious,\nsuddenly, that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest?\n\nThere was still unbroken silence between Katharine and Ralph Denham,\nbut the occupants of the different cages served instead of speech.\n\n\"What have you been doing since we met?\" Ralph asked at length.\n\n\"Doing?\" she pondered. \"Walking in and out of other people s houses. I\nwonder if these animals are happy?\" she speculated, stopping before a\ngray bear, who was philosophically playing with a tassel which once,\nperhaps, formed part of a lady s parasol.\n\n\"I m afraid Rodney didn t like my coming,\" Ralph remarked.\n\n\"No. But he ll soon get over that,\" she replied. The detachment\nexpressed by her voice puzzled Ralph, and he would have been glad if\nshe had explained her meaning further. But he was not going to press\nher for explanations. Each moment was to be, as far as he could make\nit, complete in itself, owing nothing of its happiness to explanations,\nborrowing neither bright nor dark tints from the future.\n\n\"The bears seem happy,\" he remarked. \"But we must buy them a bag of\nsomething. There s the place to buy buns. Let s go and get them.\" They\nwalked to the counter piled with little paper bags, and each\nsimultaneously produced a shilling and pressed it upon the young lady,\nwho did not know whether to oblige the lady or the gentleman, but\ndecided, from conventional reasons, that it was the part of the\ngentleman to pay.\n\n\"I wish to pay,\" said Ralph peremptorily, refusing the coin which\nKatharine tendered. \"I have a reason for what I do,\" he added, seeing\nher smile at his tone of decision.\n\n\"I believe you have a reason for everything,\" she agreed, breaking the\nbun into parts and tossing them down the bears  throats, \"but I can t\nbelieve it s a good one this time. What is your reason?\"\n\nHe refused to tell her. He could not explain to her that he was\noffering up consciously all his happiness to her, and wished, absurdly\nenough, to pour every possession he had upon the blazing pyre, even his\nsilver and gold. He wished to keep this distance between them the\ndistance which separates the devotee from the image in the shrine.\n\nCircumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have been,\nhad they been seated in a drawing-room, for example, with a tea-tray\nbetween them. He saw her against a background of pale grottos and sleek\nhides; camels slanted their heavy-lidded eyes at her, giraffes\nfastidiously observed her from their melancholy eminence, and the\npink-lined trunks of elephants cautiously abstracted buns from her\noutstretched hands. Then there were the hothouses. He saw her bending\nover pythons coiled upon the sand, or considering the brown rock\nbreaking the stagnant water of the alligators  pool, or searching some\nminute section of tropical forest for the golden eye of a lizard or the\nindrawn movement of the green frogs  flanks. In particular, he saw her\noutlined against the deep green waters, in which squadrons of silvery\nfish wheeled incessantly, or ogled her for a moment, pressing their\ndistorted mouths against the glass, quivering their tails straight out\nbehind them. Again, there was the insect house, where she lifted the\nblinds of the little cages, and marveled at the purple circles marked\nupon the rich tussore wings of some lately emerged and semi-conscious\nbutterfly, or at caterpillars immobile like the knobbed twigs of a\npale-skinned tree, or at slim green snakes stabbing the glass wall\nagain and again with their flickering cleft tongues. The heat of the\nair, and the bloom of heavy flowers, which swam in water or rose\nstiffly from great red jars, together with the display of curious\npatterns and fantastic shapes, produced an atmosphere in which human\nbeings tended to look pale and to fall silent.\n\nOpening the door of a house which rang with the mocking and profoundly\nunhappy laughter of monkeys, they discovered William and Cassandra.\nWilliam appeared to be tempting some small reluctant animal to descend\nfrom an upper perch to partake of half an apple. Cassandra was reading\nout, in her high-pitched tones, an account of this creature s secluded\ndisposition and nocturnal habits. She saw Katharine and exclaimed:\n\n\"Here you are! Do prevent William from torturing this unfortunate\naye-aye.\"\n\n\"We thought we d lost you,\" said William. He looked from one to the\nother, and seemed to take stock of Denham s unfashionable appearance.\nHe seemed to wish to find some outlet for malevolence, but, failing\none, he remained silent. The glance, the slight quiver of the upper\nlip, were not lost upon Katharine.\n\n\"William isn t kind to animals,\" she remarked. \"He doesn t know what\nthey like and what they don t like.\"\n\n\"I take it you re well versed in these matters, Denham,\" said Rodney,\nwithdrawing his hand with the apple.\n\n\"It s mainly a question of knowing how to stroke them,\" Denham replied.\n\n\"Which is the way to the Reptile House?\" Cassandra asked him, not from\na genuine desire to visit the reptiles, but in obedience to her\nnew-born feminine susceptibility, which urged her to charm and\nconciliate the other sex. Denham began to give her directions, and\nKatharine and William moved on together.\n\n\"I hope you ve had a pleasant afternoon,\" William remarked.\n\n\"I like Ralph Denham,\" she replied.\n\n\" a se voit,\" William returned, with superficial urbanity.\n\nMany retorts were obvious, but wishing, on the whole, for peace,\nKatharine merely inquired:\n\n\"Are you coming back to tea?\"\n\n\"Cassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland\nPlace,\" he replied. \"I don t know whether you and Denham would care to\njoin us.\"\n\n\"I ll ask him,\" she replied, turning her head to look for him. But he\nand Cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more.\n\nWilliam and Katharine watched them for a moment, and each looked\ncuriously at the object of the other s preference. But resting his eye\nupon Cassandra, to whose elegance the dressmakers had now done justice,\nWilliam said sharply:\n\n\"If you come, I hope you won t do your best to make me ridiculous.\"\n\n\"If that s what you re afraid of I certainly shan t come,\" Katharine\nreplied.\n\nThey were professedly looking into the enormous central cage of\nmonkeys, and being thoroughly annoyed by William, she compared him to a\nwretched misanthropical ape, huddled in a scrap of old shawl at the end\nof a pole, darting peevish glances of suspicion and distrust at his\ncompanions. Her tolerance was deserting her. The events of the past\nweek had worn it thin. She was in one of those moods, perhaps not\nuncommon with either sex, when the other becomes very clearly\ndistinguished, and of contemptible baseness, so that the necessity of\nassociation is degrading, and the tie, which at such moments is always\nextremely close, drags like a halter round the neck. William s exacting\ndemands and his jealousy had pulled her down into some horrible swamp\nof her nature where the primeval struggle between man and woman still\nrages.\n\n\"You seem to delight in hurting me,\" William persisted. \"Why did you\nsay that just now about my behavior to animals?\" As he spoke he rattled\nhis stick against the bars of the cage, which gave his words an\naccompaniment peculiarly exasperating to Katharine s nerves.\n\n\"Because it s true. You never see what any one feels,\" she said. \"You\nthink of no one but yourself.\"\n\n\"That is not true,\" said William. By his determined rattling he had now\ncollected the animated attention of some half-dozen apes. Either to\npropitiate them, or to show his consideration for their feelings, he\nproceeded to offer them the apple which he held.\n\nThe sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration of\nthe picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that Katharine\nwas seized with laughter. She laughed uncontrollably. William flushed\nred. No display of anger could have hurt his feelings more profoundly.\nIt was not only that she was laughing at him; the detachment of the\nsound was horrible.\n\n\"I don t know what you re laughing at,\" he muttered, and, turning,\nfound that the other couple had rejoined them. As if the matter had\nbeen privately agreed upon, the couples separated once more, Katharine\nand Denham passing out of the house without more than a perfunctory\nglance round them. Denham obeyed what seemed to be Katharine s wish in\nthus making haste. Some change had come over her. He connected it with\nher laughter, and her few words in private with Rodney; he felt that\nshe had become unfriendly to him. She talked, but her remarks were\nindifferent, and when he spoke her attention seemed to wander. This\nchange of mood was at first extremely disagreeable to him; but soon he\nfound it salutary. The pale drizzling atmosphere of the day affected\nhim, also. The charm, the insidious magic in which he had luxuriated,\nwere suddenly gone; his feeling had become one of friendly respect, and\nto his great pleasure he found himself thinking spontaneously of the\nrelief of finding himself alone in his room that night. In his surprise\nat the suddenness of the change, and at the extent of his freedom, he\nbethought him of a daring plan, by which the ghost of Katharine could\nbe more effectually exorcised than by mere abstinence. He would ask her\nto come home with him to tea. He would force her through the mill of\nfamily life; he would place her in a light unsparing and revealing. His\nfamily would find nothing to admire in her, and she, he felt certain,\nwould despise them all, and this, too, would help him. He felt himself\nbecoming more and more merciless towards her. By such courageous\nmeasures any one, he thought, could end the absurd passions which were\nthe cause of so much pain and waste. He could foresee a time when his\nexperiences, his discovery, and his triumph were made available for\nyounger brothers who found themselves in the same predicament. He\nlooked at his watch, and remarked that the gardens would soon be\nclosed.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he added, \"I think we ve seen enough for one afternoon. Where\nhave the others got to?\" He looked over his shoulder, and, seeing no\ntrace of them, remarked at once:\n\n\"We d better be independent of them. The best plan will be for you to\ncome back to tea with me.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn t you come with me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because we re next door to Highgate here,\" he replied promptly.\n\nShe assented, having very little notion whether Highgate was next door\nto Regent s Park or not. She was only glad to put off her return to the\nfamily tea-table in Chelsea for an hour or two. They proceeded with\ndogged determination through the winding roads of Regent s Park, and\nthe Sunday-stricken streets of the neighborhood, in the direction of\nthe Tube station. Ignorant of the way, she resigned herself entirely to\nhim, and found his silence a convenient cover beneath which to continue\nher anger with Rodney.\n\nWhen they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom of\nHighgate, she wondered, for the first time, where he was taking her.\nHad he a family, or did he live alone in rooms? On the whole she was\ninclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged, and possibly\ninvalid, mother. She sketched lightly, upon the blank vista down which\nthey walked, the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising\nfrom behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering words about \"my\nson s friends,\" and was on the point of asking Ralph to tell her what\nshe might expect, when he jerked open one of the infinite number of\nidentical wooden doors, and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the\nAlpine style of architecture. As they listened to the shaking of the\nbell in the basement, she could summon no vision to replace the one so\nrudely destroyed.\n\n\"I must warn you to expect a family party,\" said Ralph. \"They re mostly\nin on Sundays. We can go to my room afterwards.\"\n\n\"Have you many brothers and sisters?\" she asked, without concealing her\ndismay.\n\n\"Six or seven,\" he replied grimly, as the door opened.\n\nWhile Ralph took off his coat, she had time to notice the ferns and\nphotographs and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a babble, of\nvoices talking each other down, from the sound of them. The rigidity of\nextreme shyness came over her. She kept as far behind Denham as she\ncould, and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded\nlights, which fell upon a number of people, of different ages, sitting\nround a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food, and\nunflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas. Ralph walked straight to the\nfar end of the table.\n\n\"Mother, this is Miss Hilbery,\" he said.\n\nA large elderly lady, bent over an unsatisfactory spirit-lamp, looked\nup with a little frown, and observed:\n\n\"I beg your pardon. I thought you were one of my own girls. Dorothy,\"\nshe continued on the same breath, to catch the servant before she left\nthe room, \"we shall want some more methylated spirits unless the lamp\nitself is out of order. If one of you could invent a good spirit-lamp \"\nshe sighed, looking generally down the table, and then began seeking\namong the china before her for two clean cups for the new-comers.\n\nThe unsparing light revealed more ugliness than Katharine had seen in\none room for a very long time. It was the ugliness of enormous folds of\nbrown material, looped and festooned, of plush curtains, from which\ndepended balls and fringes, partially concealing bookshelves swollen\nwith black school-texts. Her eye was arrested by crossed scabbards of\nfretted wood upon the dull green wall, and wherever there was a high\nflat eminence, some fern waved from a pot of crinkled china, or a\nbronze horse reared so high that the stump of a tree had to sustain his\nforequarters. The waters of family life seemed to rise and close over\nher head, and she munched in silence.\n\nAt length Mrs. Denham looked up from her teacups and remarked:\n\n\"You see, Miss Hilbery, my children all come in at different hours and\nwant different things. (The tray should go up if you ve done, Johnnie.)\nMy boy Charles is in bed with a cold. What else can you\nexpect? standing in the wet playing football. We did try drawing-room\ntea, but it didn t do.\"\n\nA boy of sixteen, who appeared to be Johnnie, grumbled derisively both\nat the notion of drawing-room tea and at the necessity of carrying a\ntray up to his brother. But he took himself off, being enjoined by his\nmother to mind what he was doing, and shut the door after him.\n\n\"It s much nicer like this,\" said Katharine, applying herself with\ndetermination to the dissection of her cake; they had given her too\nlarge a slice. She knew that Mrs. Denham suspected her of critical\ncomparisons. She knew that she was making poor progress with her cake.\nMrs. Denham had looked at her sufficiently often to make it clear to\nKatharine that she was asking who this young woman was, and why Ralph\nhad brought her to tea with them. There was an obvious reason, which\nMrs. Denham had probably reached by this time. Outwardly, she was\nbehaving with rather rusty and laborious civility. She was making\nconversation about the amenities of Highgate, its development and\nsituation.\n\n\"When I first married,\" she said, \"Highgate was quite separate from\nLondon, Miss Hilbery, and this house, though you wouldn t believe it,\nhad a view of apple orchards. That was before the Middletons built\ntheir house in front of us.\"\n\n\"It must be a great advantage to live at the top of a hill,\" said\nKatharine. Mrs. Denham agreed effusively, as if her opinion of\nKatharine s sense had risen.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, we find it very healthy,\" she said, and she went on, as\npeople who live in the suburbs so often do, to prove that it was\nhealthier, more convenient, and less spoilt than any suburb round\nLondon. She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she\nexpressed unpopular views, and that her children disagreed with her.\n\n\"The ceiling s fallen down in the pantry again,\" said Hester, a girl of\neighteen, abruptly.\n\n\"The whole house will be down one of these days,\" James muttered.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Denham. \"It s only a little bit of plaster I\ndon t see how any house could be expected to stand the wear and tear\nyou give it.\" Here some family joke exploded, which Katharine could not\nfollow. Even Mrs. Denham laughed against her will.\n\n\"Miss Hilbery s thinking us all so rude,\" she added reprovingly. Miss\nHilbery smiled and shook her head, and was conscious that a great many\neyes rested upon her, for a moment, as if they would find pleasure in\ndiscussing her when she was gone. Owing, perhaps, to this critical\nglance, Katharine decided that Ralph Denham s family was commonplace,\nunshapely, lacking in charm, and fitly expressed by the hideous nature\nof their furniture and decorations. She glanced along a mantelpiece\nranged with bronze chariots, silver vases, and china ornaments that\nwere either facetious or eccentric.\n\nShe did not apply her judgment consciously to Ralph, but when she\nlooked at him, a moment later, she rated him lower than at any other\ntime of their acquaintanceship.\n\nHe had made no effort to tide over the discomforts of her introduction,\nand now, engaged in argument with his brother, apparently forgot her\npresence. She must have counted upon his support more than she\nrealized, for this indifference, emphasized, as it was, by the\ninsignificant commonplace of his surroundings, awoke her, not only to\nthat ugliness, but to her own folly. She thought of one scene after\nanother in a few seconds, with that shudder which is almost a blush.\nShe had believed him when he spoke of friendship. She had believed in a\nspiritual light burning steadily and steadfastly behind the erratic\ndisorder and incoherence of life. The light was now gone out, suddenly,\nas if a sponge had blotted it. The litter of the table and the tedious\nbut exacting conversation of Mrs. Denham remained: they struck, indeed,\nupon a mind bereft of all defences, and, keenly conscious of the\ndegradation which is the result of strife whether victorious or not,\nshe thought gloomily of her loneliness, of life s futility, of the\nbarren prose of reality, of William Rodney, of her mother, and the\nunfinished book.\n\nHer answers to Mrs. Denham were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness,\nand to Ralph, who watched her narrowly, she seemed further away than\nwas compatible with her physical closeness. He glanced at her, and\nground out further steps in his argument, determined that no folly\nshould remain when this experience was over. Next moment, a silence,\nsudden and complete, descended upon them all. The silence of all these\npeople round the untidy table was enormous and hideous; something\nhorrible seemed about to burst from it, but they endured it\nobstinately. A second later the door opened and there was a stir of\nrelief; cries of \"Hullo, Joan! There s nothing left for you to eat,\"\nbroke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the\ntable-cloth, and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little\nwaves again. It was obvious that Joan had some mysterious and\nbeneficent power upon her family. She went up to Katharine as if she\nhad heard of her, and was very glad to see her at last. She explained\nthat she had been visiting an uncle who was ill, and that had kept her.\nNo, she hadn t had any tea, but a slice of bread would do. Some one\nhanded up a hot cake, which had been keeping warm in the fender; she\nsat down by her mother s side, Mrs. Denham s anxieties seemed to relax,\nand every one began eating and drinking, as if tea had begun over\nagain. Hester voluntarily explained to Katharine that she was reading\nto pass some examination, because she wanted more than anything in the\nwhole world to go to Newnham.\n\n\"Now, just let me hear you decline  amo  I love,\" Johnnie demanded.\n\n\"No, Johnnie, no Greek at meal-times,\" said Joan, overhearing him\ninstantly. \"She s up at all hours of the night over her books, Miss\nHilbery, and I m sure that s not the way to pass examinations,\" she\nwent on, smiling at Katharine, with the worried humorous smile of the\nelder sister whose younger brothers and sisters have become almost like\nchildren of her own.\n\n\"Joan, you don t really think that  amo  is Greek?\" Ralph\n\nasked.\n\n\"Did I say Greek? Well, never mind. No dead languages at tea-time. My\ndear boy, don t trouble to make me any toast \"\n\n\"Or if you do, surely there s the toasting-fork somewhere?\" said Mrs.\nDenham, still cherishing the belief that the bread-knife could be\nspoilt. \"Do one of you ring and ask for one,\" she said, without any\nconviction that she would be obeyed. \"But is Ann coming to be with\nUncle Joseph?\" she continued. \"If so, surely they had better send Amy\nto us \" and in the mysterious delight of learning further details of\nthese arrangements, and suggesting more sensible plans of her own,\nwhich, from the aggrieved way in which she spoke, she did not seem to\nexpect any one to adopt, Mrs. Denham completely forgot the presence of\na well-dressed visitor, who had to be informed about the amenities of\nHighgate. As soon as Joan had taken her seat, an argument had sprung up\non either side of Katharine, as to whether the Salvation Army has any\nright to play hymns at street corners on Sunday mornings, thereby\nmaking it impossible for James to have his sleep out, and tampering\nwith the rights of individual liberty.\n\n\"You see, James likes to lie in bed and sleep like a hog,\" said\nJohnnie, explaining himself to Katharine, whereupon James fired up and,\nmaking her his goal, also exclaimed:\n\n\"Because Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep out.\nJohnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry \"\n\nThey appealed to her, and she forgot her cake and began to laugh and\ntalk and argue with sudden animation. The large family seemed to her so\nwarm and various that she forgot to censure them for their taste in\npottery. But the personal question between James and Johnnie merged\ninto some argument already, apparently, debated, so that the parts had\nbeen distributed among the family, in which Ralph took the lead; and\nKatharine found herself opposed to him and the champion of Johnnie s\ncause, who, it appeared, always lost his head and got excited in\nargument with Ralph.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that s what I mean. She s got it right,\" he exclaimed, after\nKatharine had restated his case, and made it more precise. The debate\nwas left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph. They looked into each\nother s eyes fixedly, like wrestlers trying to see what movement is\ncoming next, and while Ralph spoke, Katharine bit her lower lip, and\nwas always ready with her next point as soon as he had done. They were\nvery well matched, and held the opposite views.\n\nBut at the most exciting stage of the argument, for no reason that\nKatharine could see, all chairs were pushed back, and one after another\nthe Denham family got up and went out of the door, as if a bell had\nsummoned them. She was not used to the clockwork regulations of a large\nfamily. She hesitated in what she was saying, and rose. Mrs. Denham and\nJoan had drawn together and stood by the fireplace, slightly raising\ntheir skirts above their ankles, and discussing something which had an\nair of being very serious and very private. They appeared to have\nforgotten her presence among them. Ralph stood holding the door open\nfor her.\n\n\"Won t you come up to my room?\" he said. And Katharine, glancing back\nat Joan, who smiled at her in a preoccupied way, followed Ralph\nupstairs. She was thinking of their argument, and when, after the long\nclimb, he opened his door, she began at once.\n\n\"The question is, then, at what point is it right for the individual to\nassert his will against the will of the State.\"\n\nFor some time they continued the argument, and then the intervals\nbetween one statement and the next became longer and longer, and they\nspoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously, and at last fell\nsilent. Katharine went over the argument in her mind, remembering how,\nnow and then, it had been set conspicuously on the right course by some\nremark offered either by James or by Johnnie.\n\n\"Your brothers are very clever,\" she said. \"I suppose you re in the\nhabit of arguing?\"\n\n\"James and Johnnie will go on like that for hours,\" Ralph replied. \"So\nwill Hester, if you start her upon Elizabethan dramatists.\"\n\n\"And the little girl with the pigtail?\"\n\n\"Molly? She s only ten. But they re always arguing among themselves.\"\n\nHe was immensely pleased by Katharine s praise of his brothers and\nsisters. He would have liked to go on telling her about them, but he\nchecked himself.\n\n\"I see that it must be difficult to leave them,\" Katharine continued.\nHis deep pride in his family was more evident to him, at that moment,\nthan ever before, and the idea of living alone in a cottage was\nridiculous. All that brotherhood and sisterhood, and a common childhood\nin a common past mean, all the stability, the unambitious comradeship,\nand tacit understanding of family life at its best, came to his mind,\nand he thought of them as a company, of which he was the leader, bound\non a difficult, dreary, but glorious voyage. And it was Katharine who\nhad opened his eyes to this, he thought.\n\nA little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her\nattention.\n\n\"My tame rook,\" he explained briefly. \"A cat had bitten one of its\nlegs.\" She looked at the rook, and her eyes went from one object to\nanother.\n\n\"You sit here and read?\" she said, her eyes resting upon his books. He\nsaid that he was in the habit of working there at night.\n\n\"The great advantage of Highgate is the view over London. At night the\nview from my window is splendid.\" He was extremely anxious that she\nshould appreciate his view, and she rose to see what was to be seen. It\nwas already dark enough for the turbulent haze to be yellow with the\nlight of street lamps, and she tried to determine the quarters of the\ncity beneath her. The sight of her gazing from his window gave him a\npeculiar satisfaction. When she turned, at length, he was still sitting\nmotionless in his chair.\n\n\"It must be late,\" she said. \"I must be going.\" She settled upon the\narm of the chair irresolutely, thinking that she had no wish to go\nhome. William would be there, and he would find some way of making\nthings unpleasant for her, and the memory of their quarrel came back to\nher. She had noticed Ralph s coldness, too. She looked at him, and from\nhis fixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory,\nsome argument. He had thought, perhaps, of some fresh point in his\nposition, as to the bounds of personal liberty. She waited, silently,\nthinking about liberty.\n\n\"You ve won again,\" he said at last, without moving.\n\n\"I ve won?\" she repeated, thinking of the argument.\n\n\"I wish to God I hadn t asked you here,\" he burst out.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"When you re here, it s different I m happy. You ve only to walk to the\nwindow you ve only to talk about liberty. When I saw you down there\namong them all \" He stopped short.\n\n\"You thought how ordinary I was.\"\n\n\"I tried to think so. But I thought you more wonderful than ever.\"\n\nAn immense relief, and a reluctance to enjoy that relief, conflicted in\nher heart.\n\nShe slid down into the chair.\n\n\"I thought you disliked me,\" she said.\n\n\"God knows I tried,\" he replied. \"I ve done my best to see you as you\nare, without any of this damned romantic nonsense. That was why I asked\nyou here, and it s increased my folly. When you re gone I shall look\nout of that window and think of you. I shall waste the whole evening\nthinking of you. I shall waste my whole life, I believe.\"\n\nHe spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared; she frowned;\nand her tone changed to one almost of severity.\n\n\"This is what I foretold. We shall gain nothing but unhappiness. Look\nat me, Ralph.\" He looked at her. \"I assure you that I m far more\nordinary than I appear. Beauty means nothing whatever. In fact, the\nmost beautiful women are generally the most stupid. I m not that, but\nI m a matter-of-fact, prosaic, rather ordinary character; I order the\ndinner, I pay the bills, I do the accounts, I wind up the clock, and I\nnever look at a book.\"\n\n\"You forget \" he began, but she would not let him speak.\n\n\"You come and see me among flowers and pictures, and think me\nmysterious, romantic, and all the rest of it. Being yourself very\ninexperienced and very emotional, you go home and invent a story about\nme, and now you can t separate me from the person you ve imagined me to\nbe. You call that, I suppose, being in love; as a matter of fact it s\nbeing in delusion. All romantic people are the same,\" she added. \"My\nmother spends her life in making stories about the people she s fond\nof. But I won t have you do it about me, if I can help it.\"\n\n\"You can t help it,\" he said.\n\n\"I warn you it s the source of all evil.\"\n\n\"And of all good,\" he added.\n\n\"You ll find out that I m not what you think me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But I shall gain more than I lose.\"\n\n\"If such gain s worth having.\"\n\nThey were silent for a space.\n\n\"That may be what we have to face,\" he said. \"There may be nothing\nelse. Nothing but what we imagine.\"\n\n\"The reason of our loneliness,\" she mused, and they were silent for a\ntime.\n\n\"When are you to be married?\" he asked abruptly, with a change of tone.\n\n\"Not till September, I think. It s been put off.\"\n\n\"You won t be lonely then,\" he said. \"According to what people say,\nmarriage is a very queer business. They say it s different from\nanything else. It may be true. I ve known one or two cases where it\nseems to be true.\" He hoped that she would go on with the subject. But\nshe made no reply. He had done his best to master himself, and his\nvoice was sufficiently indifferent, but her silence tormented him. She\nwould never speak to him of Rodney of her own accord, and her reserve\nleft a whole continent of her soul in darkness.\n\n\"It may be put off even longer than that,\" she said, as if by an\nafterthought. \"Some one in the office is ill, and William has to take\nhis place. We may put it off for some time in fact.\"\n\n\"That s rather hard on him, isn t it?\" Ralph asked.\n\n\"He has his work,\" she replied. \"He has lots of things that interest\nhim.... I know I ve been to that place,\" she broke off, pointing to a\nphotograph. \"But I can t remember where it is oh, of course it s\nOxford. Now, what about your cottage?\"\n\n\"I m not going to take it.\"\n\n\"How you change your mind!\" she smiled.\n\n\"It s not that,\" he said impatiently. \"It s that I want to be where I\ncan see you.\"\n\n\"Our compact is going to hold in spite of all I ve said?\" she asked.\n\n\"For ever, so far as I m concerned,\" he replied.\n\n\"You re going to go on dreaming and imagining and making up stories\nabout me as you walk along the street, and pretending that we re riding\nin a forest, or landing on an island \"\n\n\"No. I shall think of you ordering dinner, paying bills, doing the\naccounts, showing old ladies the relics \"\n\n\"That s better,\" she said. \"You can think of me to-morrow morning\nlooking up dates in the  Dictionary of National Biography. \"\n\n\"And forgetting your purse,\" Ralph added.\n\nAt this she smiled, but in another moment her smile faded, either\nbecause of his words or of the way in which he spoke them. She was\ncapable of forgetting things. He saw that. But what more did he see?\nWas he not looking at something she had never shown to anybody? Was it\nnot something so profound that the notion of his seeing it almost\nshocked her? Her smile faded, and for a moment she seemed upon the\npoint of speaking, but looking at him in silence, with a look that\nseemed to ask what she could not put into words, she turned and bade\nhim good night.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVIII\n\n\nLike a strain of music, the effect of Katharine s presence slowly died\nfrom the room in which Ralph sat alone. The music had ceased in the\nrapture of its melody. He strained to catch the faintest lingering\nechoes; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace; but soon it\nfailed, and he paced the room so hungry for the sound to come again\nthat he was conscious of no other desire left in life. She had gone\nwithout speaking; abruptly a chasm had been cut in his course, down\nwhich the tide of his being plunged in disorder; fell upon rocks; flung\nitself to destruction. The distress had an effect of physical ruin and\ndisaster. He trembled; he was white; he felt exhausted, as if by a\ngreat physical effort. He sank at last into a chair standing opposite\nher empty one, and marked, mechanically, with his eye upon the clock,\nhow she went farther and farther from him, was home now, and now,\ndoubtless, again with Rodney. But it was long before he could realize\nthese facts; the immense desire for her presence churned his senses\ninto foam, into froth, into a haze of emotion that removed all facts\nfrom his grasp, and gave him a strange sense of distance, even from the\nmaterial shapes of wall and window by which he was surrounded. The\nprospect of the future, now that the strength of his passion was\nrevealed to him, appalled him.\n\nThe marriage would take place in September, she had said; that allowed\nhim, then, six full months in which to undergo these terrible extremes\nof emotion. Six months of torture, and after that the silence of the\ngrave, the isolation of the insane, the exile of the damned; at best, a\nlife from which the chief good was knowingly and for ever excluded. An\nimpartial judge might have assured him that his chief hope of recovery\nlay in this mystic temper, which identified a living woman with much\nthat no human beings long possess in the eyes of each other; she would\npass, and the desire for her vanish, but his belief in what she stood\nfor, detached from her, would remain. This line of thought offered,\nperhaps, some respite, and possessed of a brain that had its station\nconsiderably above the tumult of the senses, he tried to reduce the\nvague and wandering incoherency of his emotions to order. The sense of\nself-preservation was strong in him, and Katharine herself had\nstrangely revived it by convincing him that his family deserved and\nneeded all his strength. She was right, and for their sake, if not for\nhis own, this passion, which could bear no fruit, must be cut off,\nuprooted, shown to be as visionary and baseless as she had maintained.\nThe best way of achieving this was not to run away from her, but to\nface her, and having steeped himself in her qualities, to convince his\nreason that they were, as she assured him, not those that he imagined.\nShe was a practical woman, a domestic wife for an inferior poet,\nendowed with romantic beauty by some freak of unintelligent Nature. No\ndoubt her beauty itself would not stand examination. He had the means\nof settling this point at least. He possessed a book of photographs\nfrom the Greek statues; the head of a goddess, if the lower part were\nconcealed, had often given him the ecstasy of being in Katharine s\npresence. He took it down from the shelf and found the picture. To this\nhe added a note from her, bidding him meet her at the Zoo. He had a\nflower which he had picked at Kew to teach her botany. Such were his\nrelics. He placed them before him, and set himself to visualize her so\nclearly that no deception or delusion was possible. In a second he\ncould see her, with the sun slanting across her dress, coming towards\nhim down the green walk at Kew. He made her sit upon the seat beside\nhim. He heard her voice, so low and yet so decided in its tone; she\nspoke reasonably of indifferent matters. He could see her faults, and\nanalyze her virtues. His pulse became quieter, and his brain increased\nin clarity. This time she could not escape him. The illusion of her\npresence became more and more complete. They seemed to pass in and out\nof each other s minds, questioning and answering. The utmost fullness\nof communion seemed to be theirs. Thus united, he felt himself raised\nto an eminence, exalted, and filled with a power of achievement such as\nhe had never known in singleness. Once more he told over\nconscientiously her faults, both of face and character; they were\nclearly known to him; but they merged themselves in the flawless union\nthat was born of their association. They surveyed life to its uttermost\nlimits. How deep it was when looked at from this height! How sublime!\nHow the commonest things moved him almost to tears! Thus, he forgot the\ninevitable limitations; he forgot her absence, he thought it of no\naccount whether she married him or another; nothing mattered, save that\nshe should exist, and that he should love her. Some words of these\nreflections were uttered aloud, and it happened that among them were\nthe words, \"I love her.\" It was the first time that he had used the\nword \"love\" to describe his feeling; madness, romance, hallucination he\nhad called it by these names before; but having, apparently by\naccident, stumbled upon the word \"love,\" he repeated it again and again\nwith a sense of revelation.\n\n\"But I m in love with you!\" he exclaimed, with something like dismay.\nHe leant against the window-sill, looking over the city as she had\nlooked. Everything had become miraculously different and completely\ndistinct. His feelings were justified and needed no further\nexplanation. But he must impart them to some one, because his discovery\nwas so important that it concerned other people too. Shutting the book\nof Greek photographs, and hiding his relics, he ran downstairs,\nsnatched his coat, and passed out of doors.\n\nThe lamps were being lit, but the streets were dark enough and empty\nenough to let him walk his fastest, and to talk aloud as he walked. He\nhad no doubt where he was going. He was going to find Mary Datchet. The\ndesire to share what he felt, with some one who understood it, was so\nimperious that he did not question it. He was soon in her street. He\nran up the stairs leading to her flat two steps at a time, and it never\ncrossed his mind that she might not be at home. As he rang her bell, he\nseemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful\nthat was separate from himself, and gave him power and authority over\nall other people. Mary came to the door after a moment s pause. He was\nperfectly silent, and in the dusk his face looked completely white. He\nfollowed her into her room.\n\n\"Do you know each other?\" she said, to his extreme surprise, for he had\ncounted on finding her alone. A young man rose, and said that he knew\nRalph by sight.\n\n\"We were just going through some papers,\" said Mary. \"Mr. Basnett has\nto help me, because I don t know much about my work yet. It s the new\nsociety,\" she explained. \"I m the secretary. I m no longer at Russell\nSquare.\"\n\nThe voice in which she gave this information was so constrained as to\nsound almost harsh.\n\n\"What are your aims?\" said Ralph. He looked neither at Mary nor at Mr.\nBasnett. Mr. Basnett thought he had seldom seen a more disagreeable or\nformidable man than this friend of Mary s, this sarcastic-looking,\nwhite-faced Mr. Denham, who seemed to demand, as if by right, an\naccount of their proposals, and to criticize them before he had heard\nthem. Nevertheless, he explained his projects as clearly as he could,\nand knew that he wished Mr. Denham to think well of them.\n\n\"I see,\" said Ralph, when he had done. \"D you know, Mary,\" he suddenly\nremarked, \"I believe I m in for a cold. Have you any quinine?\" The look\nwhich he cast at her frightened her; it expressed mutely, perhaps\nwithout his own consciousness, something deep, wild, and passionate.\nShe left the room at once. Her heart beat fast at the knowledge of\nRalph s presence; but it beat with pain, and with an extraordinary\nfear. She stood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room.\n\n\"Of course, I agree with you,\" she heard Ralph say, in this strange\nvoice, to Mr. Basnett. \"But there s more that might be done. Have you\nseen Judson, for instance? You should make a point of getting him.\"\n\nMary returned with the quinine.\n\n\"Judson s address?\" Mr. Basnett inquired, pulling out his notebook and\npreparing to write. For twenty minutes, perhaps, he wrote down names,\naddresses, and other suggestions that Ralph dictated to him. Then, when\nRalph fell silent, Mr. Basnett felt that his presence was not desired,\nand thanking Ralph for his help, with a sense that he was very young\nand ignorant compared with him, he said good-bye.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Ralph, directly Mr. Basnett had shut the door and they\nwere alone together. \"Mary,\" he repeated. But the old difficulty of\nspeaking to Mary without reserve prevented him from continuing. His\ndesire to proclaim his love for Katharine was still strong in him, but\nhe had felt, directly he saw Mary, that he could not share it with her.\nThe feeling increased as he sat talking to Mr. Basnett. And yet all the\ntime he was thinking of Katharine, and marveling at his love. The tone\nin which he spoke Mary s name was harsh.\n\n\"What is it, Ralph?\" she asked, startled by his tone. She looked at him\nanxiously, and her little frown showed that she was trying painfully to\nunderstand him, and was puzzled. He could feel her groping for his\nmeaning, and he was annoyed with her, and thought how he had always\nfound her slow, painstaking, and clumsy. He had behaved badly to her,\ntoo, which made his irritation the more acute. Without waiting for him\nto answer, she rose as if his answer were indifferent to her, and began\nto put in order some papers that Mr. Basnett had left on the table. She\nhummed a scrap of a tune under her breath, and moved about the room as\nif she were occupied in making things tidy, and had no other concern.\n\n\"You ll stay and dine?\" she said casually, returning to her seat.\n\n\"No,\" Ralph replied. She did not press him further. They sat side by\nside without speaking, and Mary reached her hand for her work basket,\nand took out her sewing and threaded a needle.\n\n\"That s a clever young man,\" Ralph observed, referring to Mr. Basnett.\n\n\"I m glad you thought so. It s tremendously interesting work, and\nconsidering everything, I think we ve done very well. But I m inclined\nto agree with you; we ought to try to be more conciliatory. We re\nabsurdly strict. It s difficult to see that there may be sense in what\none s opponents say, though they are one s opponents. Horace Basnett is\ncertainly too uncompromising. I mustn t forget to see that he writes\nthat letter to Judson. You re too busy, I suppose, to come on to our\ncommittee?\" She spoke in the most impersonal manner.\n\n\"I may be out of town,\" Ralph replied, with equal distance of manner.\n\n\"Our executive meets every week, of course,\" she observed. \"But some of\nour members don t come more than once a month. Members of Parliament\nare the worst; it was a mistake, I think, to ask them.\"\n\nShe went on sewing in silence.\n\n\"You ve not taken your quinine,\" she said, looking up and seeing the\ntabloids upon the mantelpiece.\n\n\"I don t want it,\" said Ralph shortly.\n\n\"Well, you know best,\" she replied tranquilly.\n\n\"Mary, I m a brute!\" he exclaimed. \"Here I come and waste your time,\nand do nothing but make myself disagreeable.\"\n\n\"A cold coming on does make one feel wretched,\" she replied.\n\n\"I ve not got a cold. That was a lie. There s nothing the matter with\nme. I m mad, I suppose. I ought to have had the decency to keep away.\nBut I wanted to see you I wanted to tell you I m in love, Mary.\" He\nspoke the word, but, as he spoke it, it seemed robbed of substance.\n\n\"In love, are you?\" she said quietly. \"I m glad, Ralph.\"\n\n\"I suppose I m in love. Anyhow, I m out of my mind. I can t think, I\ncan t work, I don t care a hang for anything in the world. Good\nHeavens, Mary! I m in torment! One moment I m happy; next I m\nmiserable. I hate her for half an hour; then I d give my whole life to\nbe with her for ten minutes; all the time I don t know what I feel, or\nwhy I feel it; it s insanity, and yet it s perfectly reasonable. Can\nyou make any sense of it? Can you see what s happened? I m raving, I\nknow; don t listen, Mary; go on with your work.\"\n\nHe rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room. He knew that\nwhat he had just said bore very little resemblance to what he felt, for\nMary s presence acted upon him like a very strong magnet, drawing from\nhim certain expressions which were not those he made use of when he\nspoke to himself, nor did they represent his deepest feelings. He felt\na little contempt for himself at having spoken thus; but somehow he had\nbeen forced into speech.\n\n\"Do sit down,\" said Mary suddenly. \"You make me so \" She spoke with\nunusual irritability, and Ralph, noticing it with surprise, sat down at\nonce.\n\n\"You haven t told me her name you d rather not, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Her name? Katharine Hilbery.\"\n\n\"But she s engaged \"\n\n\"To Rodney. They re to be married in September.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Mary. But in truth the calm of his manner, now that he\nwas sitting down once more, wrapt her in the presence of something\nwhich she felt to be so strong, so mysterious, so incalculable, that\nshe scarcely dared to attempt to intercept it by any word or question\nthat she was able to frame. She looked at Ralph blankly, with a kind of\nawe in her face, her lips slightly parted, and her brows raised. He was\napparently quite unconscious of her gaze. Then, as if she could look no\nlonger, she leant back in her chair, and half closed her eyes. The\ndistance between them hurt her terribly; one thing after another came\ninto her mind, tempting her to assail Ralph with questions, to force\nhim to confide in her, and to enjoy once more his intimacy. But she\nrejected every impulse, for she could not speak without doing violence\nto some reserve which had grown between them, putting them a little far\nfrom each other, so that he seemed to her dignified and remote, like a\nperson she no longer knew well.\n\n\"Is there anything that I could do for you?\" she asked gently, and even\nwith courtesy, at length.\n\n\"You could see her no, that s not what I want; you mustn t bother about\nme, Mary.\" He, too, spoke very gently.\n\n\"I m afraid no third person can do anything to help,\" she added.\n\n\"No,\" he shook his head. \"Katharine was saying to-day how lonely we\nare.\" She saw the effort with which he spoke Katharine s name, and\nbelieved that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment\nin the past. At any rate, she was conscious of no anger against him;\nbut rather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had\nsuffered. But in the case of Katharine it was different; she was\nindignant with Katharine.\n\n\"There s always work,\" she said, a little aggressively.\n\nRalph moved directly.\n\n\"Do you want to be working now?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no. It s Sunday,\" she replied. \"I was thinking of Katharine. She\ndoesn t understand about work. She s never had to. She doesn t know\nwhat work is. I ve only found out myself quite lately. But it s the\nthing that saves one I m sure of that.\"\n\n\"There are other things, aren t there?\" he hesitated.\n\n\"Nothing that one can count upon,\" she returned. \"After all, other\npeople \" she stopped, but forced herself to go on. \"Where should I be\nnow if I hadn t got to go to my office every day? Thousands of people\nwould tell you the same thing thousands of women. I tell you, work is\nthe only thing that saved me, Ralph.\" He set his mouth, as if her words\nrained blows on him; he looked as if he had made up his mind to bear\nanything she might say, in silence. He had deserved it, and there would\nbe relief in having to bear it. But she broke off, and rose as if to\nfetch something from the next room. Before she reached the door she\nturned back, and stood facing him, self-possessed, and yet defiant and\nformidable in her composure.\n\n\"It s all turned out splendidly for me,\" she said. \"It will for you,\ntoo. I m sure of that. Because, after all, Katharine is worth it.\"\n\n\"Mary !\" he exclaimed. But her head was turned away, and he could not\nsay what he wished to say. \"Mary, you re splendid,\" he concluded. She\nfaced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand. She had suffered and\nrelinquished, she had seen her future turned from one of infinite\npromise to one of barrenness, and yet, somehow, over what she scarcely\nknew, and with what results she could hardly foretell, she had\nconquered. With Ralph s eyes upon her, smiling straight back at him\nserenely and proudly, she knew, for the first time, that she had\nconquered. She let him kiss her hand.\n\nThe streets were empty enough on Sunday night, and if the Sabbath, and\nthe domestic amusements proper to the Sabbath, had not kept people\nindoors, a high strong wind might very probably have done so. Ralph\nDenham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance with his\nown sensations. The gusts, sweeping along the Strand, seemed at the\nsame time to blow a clear space across the sky in which stars appeared,\nand for a short time the quick-speeding silver moon riding through\nclouds, as if they were waves of water surging round her and over her.\nThey swamped her, but she emerged; they broke over her and covered her\nagain; she issued forth indomitable. In the country fields all the\nwreckage of winter was being dispersed; the dead leaves, the withered\nbracken, the dry and discolored grass, but no bud would be broken, nor\nwould the new stalks that showed above the earth take any harm, and\nperhaps to-morrow a line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in\ntheir green. But the whirl of the atmosphere alone was in Denham s\nmood, and what of star or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming\nfor a second upon heaped waves fast following each other. He had not\nbeen able to speak to Mary, though for a moment he had come near enough\nto be tantalized by a wonderful possibility of understanding. But the\ndesire to communicate something of the very greatest importance\npossessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some\nother human being; he sought their company. More by instinct than by\nconscious choice, he took the direction which led to Rodney s rooms. He\nknocked loudly upon his door; but no one answered. He rang the bell. It\ntook him some time to accept the fact that Rodney was out. When he\ncould no longer pretend that the sound of the wind in the old building\nwas the sound of some one rising from his chair, he ran downstairs\nagain, as if his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him.\nHe walked in the direction of Chelsea.\n\nBut physical fatigue, for he had not dined and had tramped both far and\nfast, made him sit for a moment upon a seat on the Embankment. One of\nthe regular occupants of those seats, an elderly man who had drunk\nhimself, probably, out of work and lodging, drifted up, begged a match,\nand sat down beside him. It was a windy night, he said; times were\nhard; some long story of bad luck and injustice followed, told so often\nthat the man seemed to be talking to himself, or, perhaps, the neglect\nof his audience had long made any attempt to catch their attention seem\nscarcely worth while. When he began to speak Ralph had a wild desire to\ntalk to him; to question him; to make him understand. He did, in fact,\ninterrupt him at one point; but it was useless. The ancient story of\nfailure, ill-luck, undeserved disaster, went down the wind,\ndisconnected syllables flying past Ralph s ears with a queer\nalternation of loudness and faintness as if, at certain moments, the\nman s memory of his wrongs revived and then flagged, dying down at last\ninto a grumble of resignation, which seemed to represent a final lapse\ninto the accustomed despair. The unhappy voice afflicted Ralph, but it\nalso angered him. And when the elderly man refused to listen and\nmumbled on, an odd image came to his mind of a lighthouse besieged by\nthe flying bodies of lost birds, who were dashed senseless, by the\ngale, against the glass. He had a strange sensation that he was both\nlighthouse and bird; he was steadfast and brilliant; and at the same\ntime he was whirled, with all other things, senseless against the\nglass. He got up, left his tribute of silver, and pressed on, with the\nwind against him. The image of the lighthouse and the storm full of\nbirds persisted, taking the place of more definite thoughts, as he\nwalked past the Houses of Parliament and down Grosvenor Road, by the\nside of the river. In his state of physical fatigue, details merged\nthemselves in the vaster prospect, of which the flying gloom and the\nintermittent lights of lamp-posts and private houses were the outward\ntoken, but he never lost his sense of walking in the direction of\nKatharine s house. He took it for granted that something would then\nhappen, and, as he walked on, his mind became more and more full of\npleasure and expectancy. Within a certain radius of her house the\nstreets came under the influence of her presence. Each house had an\nindividuality known to Ralph, because of the tremendous individuality\nof the house in which she lived. For some yards before reaching the\nHilberys  door he walked in a trance of pleasure, but when he reached\nit, and pushed the gate of the little garden open, he hesitated. He did\nnot know what to do next. There was no hurry, however, for the outside\nof the house held pleasure enough to last him some time longer. He\ncrossed the road, and leant against the balustrade of the Embankment,\nfixing his eyes upon the house.\n\nLights burnt in the three long windows of the drawing-room. The space\nof the room behind became, in Ralph s vision, the center of the dark,\nflying wilderness of the world; the justification for the welter of\nconfusion surrounding it; the steady light which cast its beams, like\nthose of a lighthouse, with searching composure over the trackless\nwaste. In this little sanctuary were gathered together several\ndifferent people, but their identity was dissolved in a general glory\nof something that might, perhaps, be called civilization; at any rate,\nall dryness, all safety, all that stood up above the surge and\npreserved a consciousness of its own, was centered in the drawing-room\nof the Hilberys. Its purpose was beneficent; and yet so far above his\nlevel as to have something austere about it, a light that cast itself\nout and yet kept itself aloof. Then he began, in his mind, to\ndistinguish different individuals within, consciously refusing as yet\nto attack the figure of Katharine. His thoughts lingered over Mrs.\nHilbery and Cassandra; and then he turned to Rodney and Mr. Hilbery.\nPhysically, he saw them bathed in that steady flow of yellow light\nwhich filled the long oblongs of the windows; in their movements they\nwere beautiful; and in their speech he figured a reserve of meaning,\nunspoken, but understood. At length, after all this half-conscious\nselection and arrangement, he allowed himself to approach the figure of\nKatharine herself; and instantly the scene was flooded with excitement.\nHe did not see her in the body; he seemed curiously to see her as a\nshape of light, the light itself; he seemed, simplified and exhausted\nas he was, to be like one of those lost birds fascinated by the\nlighthouse and held to the glass by the splendor of the blaze.\n\nThese thoughts drove him to tramp a beat up and down the pavement\nbefore the Hilberys  gate. He did not trouble himself to make any plans\nfor the future. Something of an unknown kind would decide both the\ncoming year and the coming hour. Now and again, in his vigil, he sought\nthe light in the long windows, or glanced at the ray which gilded a few\nleaves and a few blades of grass in the little garden. For a long time\nthe light burnt without changing. He had just reached the limit of his\nbeat and was turning, when the front door opened, and the aspect of the\nhouse was entirely changed. A black figure came down the little pathway\nand paused at the gate. Denham understood instantly that it was Rodney.\nWithout hesitation, and conscious only of a great friendliness for any\none coming from that lighted room, he walked straight up to him and\nstopped him. In the flurry of the wind Rodney was taken aback, and for\nthe moment tried to press on, muttering something, as if he suspected a\ndemand upon his charity.\n\n\"Goodness, Denham, what are you doing here?\" he exclaimed, recognizing\nhim.\n\nRalph mumbled something about being on his way home. They walked on\ntogether, though Rodney walked quick enough to make it plain that he\nhad no wish for company.\n\nHe was very unhappy. That afternoon Cassandra had repulsed him; he had\ntried to explain to her the difficulties of the situation, and to\nsuggest the nature of his feelings for her without saying anything\ndefinite or anything offensive to her. But he had lost his head; under\nthe goad of Katharine s ridicule he had said too much, and Cassandra,\nsuperb in her dignity and severity, had refused to hear another word,\nand threatened an immediate return to her home. His agitation, after an\nevening spent between the two women, was extreme. Moreover, he could\nnot help suspecting that Ralph was wandering near the Hilberys  house,\nat this hour, for reasons connected with Katharine. There was probably\nsome understanding between them not that anything of the kind mattered\nto him now. He was convinced that he had never cared for any one save\nCassandra, and Katharine s future was no concern of his. Aloud, he\nsaid, shortly, that he was very tired and wished to find a cab. But on\nSunday night, on the Embankment, cabs were hard to come by, and Rodney\nfound himself constrained to walk some distance, at any rate, in\nDenham s company. Denham maintained his silence. Rodney s irritation\nlapsed. He found the silence oddly suggestive of the good masculine\nqualities which he much respected, and had at this moment great reason\nto need. After the mystery, difficulty, and uncertainty of dealing with\nthe other sex, intercourse with one s own is apt to have a composing\nand even ennobling influence, since plain speaking is possible and\nsubterfuges of no avail. Rodney, too, was much in need of a confidant;\nKatharine, despite her promises of help, had failed him at the critical\nmoment; she had gone off with Denham; she was, perhaps, tormenting\nDenham as she had tormented him. How grave and stable he seemed,\nspeaking little, and walking firmly, compared with what Rodney knew of\nhis own torments and indecisions! He began to cast about for some way\nof telling the story of his relations with Katharine and Cassandra that\nwould not lower him in Denham s eyes. It then occurred to him that,\nperhaps, Katharine herself had confided in Denham; they had something\nin common; it was likely that they had discussed him that very\nafternoon. The desire to discover what they had said of him now came\nuppermost in his mind. He recalled Katharine s laugh; he remembered\nthat she had gone, laughing, to walk with Denham.\n\n\"Did you stay long after we d left?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"No. We went back to my house.\"\n\nThis seemed to confirm Rodney s belief that he had been discussed. He\nturned over the unpalatable idea for a while, in silence.\n\n\"Women are incomprehensible creatures, Denham!\" he then exclaimed.\n\n\"Um,\" said Denham, who seemed to himself possessed of complete\nunderstanding, not merely of women, but of the entire universe. He\ncould read Rodney, too, like a book. He knew that he was unhappy, and\nhe pitied him, and wished to help him.\n\n\"You say something and they fly into a passion. Or for no reason at\nall, they laugh. I take it that no amount of education will \" The\nremainder of the sentence was lost in the high wind, against which they\nhad to struggle; but Denham understood that he referred to Katharine s\nlaughter, and that the memory of it was still hurting him. In\ncomparison with Rodney, Denham felt himself very secure; he saw Rodney\nas one of the lost birds dashed senseless against the glass; one of the\nflying bodies of which the air was full. But he and Katharine were\nalone together, aloft, splendid, and luminous with a twofold radiance.\nHe pitied the unstable creature beside him; he felt a desire to protect\nhim, exposed without the knowledge which made his own way so direct.\nThey were united as the adventurous are united, though one reaches the\ngoal and the other perishes by the way.\n\n\"You couldn t laugh at some one you cared for.\"\n\nThis sentence, apparently addressed to no other human being, reached\nDenham s ears. The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it\ndirectly. Had Rodney spoken those words?\n\n\"You love her.\" Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the\nair several yards in front of him?\n\n\"I ve suffered tortures, Denham, tortures!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know that.\"\n\n\"She s laughed at me.\"\n\n\"Never to me.\"\n\nThe wind blew a space between the words blew them so far away that they\nseemed unspoken.\n\n\"How I ve loved her!\"\n\nThis was certainly spoken by the man at Denham s side. The voice had\nall the marks of Rodney s character, and recalled, with; strange\nvividness, his personal appearance. Denham could see him against the\nblank buildings and towers of the horizon. He saw him dignified,\nexalted, and tragic, as he might have appeared thinking of Katharine\nalone in his rooms at night.\n\n\"I am in love with Katharine myself. That is why I am here to-night.\"\n\nRalph spoke distinctly and deliberately, as if Rodney s confession had\nmade this statement necessary.\n\nRodney exclaimed something inarticulate.\n\n\"Ah, I ve always known it,\" he cried, \"I ve known it from the first.\nYou ll marry her!\"\n\nThe cry had a note of despair in it. Again the wind intercepted their\nwords. They said no more. At length they drew up beneath a lamp-post,\nsimultaneously.\n\n\"My God, Denham, what fools we both are!\" Rodney exclaimed. They looked\nat each other, queerly, in the light of the lamp. Fools! They seemed to\nconfess to each other the extreme depths of their folly. For the\nmoment, under the lamp-post, they seemed to be aware of some common\nknowledge which did away with the possibility of rivalry, and made them\nfeel more sympathy for each other than for any one else in the world.\nGiving simultaneously a little nod, as if in confirmation of this\nunderstanding, they parted without speaking again.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIX\n\n\nBetween twelve and one that Sunday night Katharine lay in bed, not\nasleep, but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view\nof our own lot is possible; or if we must be serious, our seriousness\nis tempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion. She saw the\nforms of Ralph, William, Cassandra, and herself, as if they were all\nequally unsubstantial, and, in putting off reality, had gained a kind\nof dignity which rested upon each impartially. Thus rid of any\nuncomfortable warmth of partisanship or load of obligation, she was\ndropping off to sleep when a light tap sounded upon her door. A moment\nlater Cassandra stood beside her, holding a candle and speaking in the\nlow tones proper to the time of night.\n\n\"Are you awake, Katharine?\"\n\n\"Yes, I m awake. What is it?\"\n\nShe roused herself, sat up, and asked what in Heaven s name Cassandra\nwas doing?\n\n\"I couldn t sleep, and I thought I d come and speak to you only for a\nmoment, though. I m going home to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Home? Why, what has happened?\"\n\n\"Something happened to-day which makes it impossible for me to stay\nhere.\"\n\nCassandra spoke formally, almost solemnly; the announcement was clearly\nprepared and marked a crisis of the utmost gravity. She continued what\nseemed to be part of a set speech.\n\n\"I have decided to tell you the whole truth, Katharine. William allowed\nhimself to behave in a way which made me extremely uncomfortable\nto-day.\"\n\nKatharine seemed to waken completely, and at once to be in control of\nherself.\n\n\"At the Zoo?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, on the way home. When we had tea.\"\n\nAs if foreseeing that the interview might be long, and the night\nchilly, Katharine advised Cassandra to wrap herself in a quilt.\nCassandra did so with unbroken solemnity.\n\n\"There s a train at eleven,\" she said. \"I shall tell Aunt Maggie that I\nhave to go suddenly.... I shall make Violet s visit an excuse. But,\nafter thinking it over, I don t see how I can go without telling you\nthe truth.\"\n\nShe was careful to abstain from looking in Katharine s direction. There\nwas a slight pause.\n\n\"But I don t see the least reason why you should go,\" said Katharine\neventually. Her voice sounded so astonishingly equable that Cassandra\nglanced at her. It was impossible to suppose that she was either\nindignant or surprised; she seemed, on the contrary, sitting up in bed,\nwith her arms clasped round her knees and a little frown on her brow,\nto be thinking closely upon a matter of indifference to her.\n\n\"Because I can t allow any man to behave to me in that way,\" Cassandra\nreplied, and she added, \"particularly when I know that he is engaged to\nsome one else.\"\n\n\"But you like him, don t you?\" Katharine inquired.\n\n\"That s got nothing to do with it,\" Cassandra exclaimed indignantly. \"I\nconsider his conduct, under the circumstances, most disgraceful.\"\n\nThis was the last of the sentences of her premeditated speech; and\nhaving spoken it she was left unprovided with any more to say in that\nparticular style. When Katharine remarked:\n\n\"I should say it had everything to do with it,\" Cassandra s\nself-possession deserted her.\n\n\"I don t understand you in the least, Katharine. How can you behave as\nyou behave? Ever since I came here I ve been amazed by you!\"\n\n\"You ve enjoyed yourself, haven t you?\" Katharine asked.\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Cassandra admitted.\n\n\"Anyhow, my behavior hasn t spoiled your visit.\"\n\n\"No,\" Cassandra allowed once more. She was completely at a loss. In her\nforecast of the interview she had taken it for granted that Katharine,\nafter an outburst of incredulity, would agree that Cassandra must\nreturn home as soon as possible. But Katharine, on the contrary,\naccepted her statement at once, seemed neither shocked nor surprised,\nand merely looked rather more thoughtful than usual. From being a\nmature woman charged with an important mission, Cassandra shrunk to the\nstature of an inexperienced child.\n\n\"Do you think I ve been very foolish about it?\" she asked.\n\nKatharine made no answer, but still sat deliberating silently, and a\ncertain feeling of alarm took possession of Cassandra. Perhaps her\nwords had struck far deeper than she had thought, into depths beyond\nher reach, as so much of Katharine was beyond her reach. She thought\nsuddenly that she had been playing with very dangerous tools.\n\nLooking at her at length, Katharine asked slowly, as if she found the\nquestion very difficult to ask.\n\n\"But do you care for William?\"\n\nShe marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girl s expression, and\nhow she looked away from her.\n\n\"Do you mean, am I in love with him?\" Cassandra asked, breathing\nquickly, and nervously moving her hands.\n\n\"Yes, in love with him,\" Katharine repeated.\n\n\"How can I love the man you re engaged to marry?\" Cassandra burst out.\n\n\"He may be in love with you.\"\n\n\"I don t think you ve any right to say such things, Katharine,\"\nCassandra exclaimed. \"Why do you say them? Don t you mind in the least\nhow William behaves to other women? If I were engaged, I couldn t bear\nit!\"\n\n\"We re not engaged,\" said Katharine, after a pause.\n\n\"Katharine!\" Cassandra cried.\n\n\"No, we re not engaged,\" Katharine repeated. \"But no one knows it but\nourselves.\"\n\n\"But why I don t understand you re not engaged!\" Cassandra said again.\n\"Oh, that explains it! You re not in love with him! You don t want to\nmarry him!\"\n\n\"We aren t in love with each other any longer,\" said Katharine, as if\ndisposing of something for ever and ever.\n\n\"How queer, how strange, how unlike other people you are, Katharine,\"\nCassandra said, her whole body and voice seeming to fall and collapse\ntogether, and no trace of anger or excitement remaining, but only a\ndreamy quietude.\n\n\"You re not in love with him?\"\n\n\"But I love him,\" said Katharine.\n\nCassandra remained bowed, as if by the weight of the revelation, for\nsome little while longer. Nor did Katharine speak. Her attitude was\nthat of some one who wishes to be concealed as much as possible from\nobservation. She sighed profoundly; she was absolutely silent, and\napparently overcome by her thoughts.\n\n\"D you know what time it is?\" she said at length, and shook her pillow,\nas if making ready for sleep.\n\nCassandra rose obediently, and once more took up her candle. Perhaps\nthe white dressing-gown, and the loosened hair, and something unseeing\nin the expression of the eyes gave her a likeness to a woman walking in\nher sleep. Katharine, at least, thought so.\n\n\"There s no reason why I should go home, then?\" Cassandra said,\npausing. \"Unless you want me to go, Katharine? What _do_ you want me to\ndo?\"\n\nFor the first time their eyes met.\n\n\"You wanted us to fall in love,\" Cassandra exclaimed, as if she read\nthe certainty there. But as she looked she saw a sight that surprised\nher. The tears rose slowly in Katharine s eyes and stood there,\nbrimming but contained the tears of some profound emotion, happiness,\ngrief, renunciation; an emotion so complex in its nature that to\nexpress it was impossible, and Cassandra, bending her head and\nreceiving the tears upon her cheek, accepted them in silence as the\nconsecration of her love.\n\n\"Please, miss,\" said the maid, about eleven o clock on the following\nmorning, \"Mrs. Milvain is in the kitchen.\"\n\nA long wicker basket of flowers and branches had arrived from the\ncountry, and Katharine, kneeling upon the floor of the drawing-room,\nwas sorting them while Cassandra watched her from an arm-chair, and\nabsent-mindedly made spasmodic offers of help which were not accepted.\nThe maid s message had a curious effect upon Katharine.\n\nShe rose, walked to the window, and, the maid being gone, said\nemphatically and even tragically:\n\n\"You know what that means.\"\n\nCassandra had understood nothing.\n\n\"Aunt Celia is in the kitchen,\" Katharine repeated.\n\n\"Why in the kitchen?\" Cassandra asked, not unnaturally.\n\n\"Probably because she s discovered something,\" Katharine replied.\nCassandra s thoughts flew to the subject of her preoccupation.\n\n\"About us?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Heaven knows,\" Katharine replied. \"I shan t let her stay in the\nkitchen, though. I shall bring her up here.\"\n\nThe sternness with which this was said suggested that to bring Aunt\nCelia upstairs was, for some reason, a disciplinary measure.\n\n\"For goodness  sake, Katharine,\" Cassandra exclaimed, jumping from her\nchair and showing signs of agitation, \"don t be rash. Don t let her\nsuspect. Remember, nothing s certain \"\n\nKatharine assured her by nodding her head several times, but the manner\nin which she left the room was not calculated to inspire complete\nconfidence in her diplomacy.\n\nMrs. Milvain was sitting, or rather perching, upon the edge of a chair\nin the servants  room. Whether there was any sound reason for her\nchoice of a subterranean chamber, or whether it corresponded with the\nspirit of her quest, Mrs. Milvain invariably came in by the back door\nand sat in the servants  room when she was engaged in confidential\nfamily transactions. The ostensible reason she gave was that neither\nMr. nor Mrs. Hilbery should be disturbed. But, in truth, Mrs. Milvain\ndepended even more than most elderly women of her generation upon the\ndelicious emotions of intimacy, agony, and secrecy, and the additional\nthrill provided by the basement was one not lightly to be forfeited.\nShe protested almost plaintively when Katharine proposed to go\nupstairs.\n\n\"I ve something that I want to say to you in _private_,\" she said,\nhesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush.\n\n\"The drawing-room is empty \"\n\n\"But we might meet your mother upon the stairs. We might disturb your\nfather,\" Mrs. Milvain objected, taking the precaution to speak in a\nwhisper already.\n\nBut as Katharine s presence was absolutely necessary to the success of\nthe interview, and as Katharine obstinately receded up the kitchen\nstairs, Mrs. Milvain had no course but to follow her. She glanced\nfurtively about her as she proceeded upstairs, drew her skirts\ntogether, and stepped with circumspection past all doors, whether they\nwere open or shut.\n\n\"Nobody will overhear us?\" she murmured, when the comparative sanctuary\nof the drawing-room had been reached. \"I see that I have interrupted\nyou,\" she added, glancing at the flowers strewn upon the floor. A\nmoment later she inquired, \"Was some one sitting with you?\" noticing a\nhandkerchief that Cassandra had dropped in her flight.\n\n\"Cassandra was helping me to put the flowers in water,\" said Katharine,\nand she spoke so firmly and clearly that Mrs. Milvain glanced nervously\nat the main door and then at the curtain which divided the little room\nwith the relics from the drawing-room.\n\n\"Ah, Cassandra is still with you,\" she remarked. \"And did William send\nyou those lovely flowers?\"\n\nKatharine sat down opposite her aunt and said neither yes nor no. She\nlooked past her, and it might have been thought that she was\nconsidering very critically the pattern of the curtains. Another\nadvantage of the basement, from Mrs. Milvain s point of view, was that\nit made it necessary to sit very close together, and the light was dim\ncompared with that which now poured through three windows upon\nKatharine and the basket of flowers, and gave even the slight angular\nfigure of Mrs. Milvain herself a halo of gold.\n\n\"They re from Stogdon House,\" said Katharine abruptly, with a little\njerk of her head.\n\nMrs. Milvain felt that it would be easier to tell her niece what she\nwished to say if they were actually in physical contact, for the\nspiritual distance between them was formidable. Katharine, however,\nmade no overtures, and Mrs. Milvain, who was possessed of rash but\nheroic courage, plunged without preface:\n\n\"People are talking about you, Katharine. That is why I have come this\nmorning. You forgive me for saying what I d much rather not say? What I\nsay is only for your own sake, my child.\"\n\n\"There s nothing to forgive yet, Aunt Celia,\" said Katharine, with\napparent good humor.\n\n\"People are saying that William goes everywhere with you and Cassandra,\nand that he is always paying her attentions. At the Markhams  dance he\nsat out five dances with her. At the Zoo they were seen alone together.\nThey left together. They never came back here till seven in the\nevening. But that is not all. They say his manner is very marked he is\nquite different when she is there.\"\n\nMrs. Milvain, whose words had run themselves together, and whose voice\nhad raised its tone almost to one of protest, here ceased, and looked\nintently at Katharine, as if to judge the effect of her communication.\nA slight rigidity had passed over Katharine s face. Her lips were\npressed together; her eyes were contracted, and they were still fixed\nupon the curtain. These superficial changes covered an extreme inner\nloathing such as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent\nspectacle. The indecent spectacle was her own action beheld for the\nfirst time from the outside; her aunt s words made her realize how\ninfinitely repulsive the body of life is without its soul.\n\n\"Well?\" she said at length.\n\nMrs. Milvain made a gesture as if to bring her closer, but it was not\nreturned.\n\n\"We all know how good you are how unselfish how you sacrifice yourself\nto others. But you ve been too unselfish, Katharine. You have made\nCassandra happy, and she has taken advantage of your goodness.\"\n\n\"I don t understand, Aunt Celia,\" said Katharine. \"What has Cassandra\ndone?\"\n\n\"Cassandra has behaved in a way that I could not have thought\npossible,\" said Mrs. Milvain warmly. \"She has been utterly\nselfish utterly heartless. I must speak to her before I go.\"\n\n\"I don t understand,\" Katharine persisted.\n\nMrs. Milvain looked at her. Was it possible that Katharine really\ndoubted? That there was something that Mrs. Milvain herself did not\nunderstand? She braced herself, and pronounced the tremendous words:\n\n\"Cassandra has stolen William s love.\"\n\nStill the words seemed to have curiously little effect.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said Katharine, \"that he has fallen in love with her?\"\n\n\"There are ways of _making_ men fall in love with one, Katharine.\"\n\nKatharine remained silent. The silence alarmed Mrs. Milvain, and she\nbegan hurriedly:\n\n\"Nothing would have made me say these things but your own good. I have\nnot wished to interfere; I have not wished to give you pain. I am a\nuseless old woman. I have no children of my own. I only want to see you\nhappy, Katharine.\"\n\nAgain she stretched forth her arms, but they remained empty.\n\n\"You are not going to say these things to Cassandra,\" said Katharine\nsuddenly. \"You ve said them to me; that s enough.\"\n\nKatharine spoke so low and with such restraint that Mrs. Milvain had to\nstrain to catch her words, and when she heard them she was dazed by\nthem.\n\n\"I ve made you angry! I knew I should!\" she exclaimed. She quivered,\nand a kind of sob shook her; but even to have made Katharine angry was\nsome relief, and allowed her to feel some of the agreeable sensations\nof martyrdom.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katharine, standing up, \"I m so angry that I don t want to\nsay anything more. I think you d better go, Aunt Celia. We don t\nunderstand each other.\"\n\nAt these words Mrs. Milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive;\nshe glanced at her niece s face, but read no pity there, whereupon she\nfolded her hands upon a black velvet bag which she carried in an\nattitude that was almost one of prayer. Whatever divinity she prayed\nto, if pray she did, at any rate she recovered her dignity in a\nsingular way and faced her niece.\n\n\"Married love,\" she said slowly and with emphasis upon every word, \"is\nthe most sacred of all loves. The love of husband and wife is the most\nholy we know. That is the lesson Mamma s children learnt from her; that\nis what they can never forget. I have tried to speak as she would have\nwished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild.\"\n\nKatharine seemed to judge this defence upon its merits, and then to\nconvict it of falsity.\n\n\"I don t see that there is any excuse for your behavior,\" she said.\n\nAt these words Mrs. Milvain rose and stood for a moment beside her\nniece. She had never met with such treatment before, and she did not\nknow with what weapons to break down the terrible wall of resistance\noffered her by one who, by virtue of youth and beauty and sex, should\nhave been all tears and supplications. But Mrs. Milvain herself was\nobstinate; upon a matter of this kind she could not admit that she was\neither beaten or mistaken. She beheld herself the champion of married\nlove in its purity and supremacy; what her niece stood for she was\nquite unable to say, but she was filled with the gravest suspicions.\nThe old woman and the young woman stood side by side in unbroken\nsilence. Mrs. Milvain could not make up her mind to withdraw while her\nprinciples trembled in the balance and her curiosity remained\nunappeased. She ransacked her mind for some question that should force\nKatharine to enlighten her, but the supply was limited, the choice\ndifficult, and while she hesitated the door opened and William Rodney\ncame in. He carried in his hand an enormous and splendid bunch of white\nand purple flowers, and, either not seeing Mrs. Milvain, or\ndisregarding her, he advanced straight to Katharine, and presented the\nflowers with the words:\n\n\"These are for you, Katharine.\"\n\nKatharine took them with a glance that Mrs. Milvain did not fail to\nintercept. But with all her experience, she did not know what to make\nof it. She watched anxiously for further illumination. William greeted\nher without obvious sign of guilt, and, explaining that he had a\nholiday, both he and Katharine seemed to take it for granted that his\nholiday should be celebrated with flowers and spent in Cheyne Walk. A\npause followed; that, too, was natural; and Mrs. Milvain began to feel\nthat she laid herself open to a charge of selfishness if she stayed.\nThe mere presence of a young man had altered her disposition curiously,\nand filled her with a desire for a scene which should end in an\nemotional forgiveness. She would have given much to clasp both nephew\nand niece in her arms. But she could not flatter herself that any hope\nof the customary exaltation remained.\n\n\"I must go,\" she said, and she was conscious of an extreme flatness of\nspirit.\n\nNeither of them said anything to stop her. William politely escorted\nher downstairs, and somehow, amongst her protests and embarrassments,\nMrs. Milvain forgot to say good-bye to Katharine. She departed,\nmurmuring words about masses of flowers and a drawing-room always\nbeautiful even in the depths of winter.\n\nWilliam came back to Katharine; he found her standing where he had left\nher.\n\n\"I ve come to be forgiven,\" he said. \"Our quarrel was perfectly hateful\nto me. I ve not slept all night. You re not angry with me, are you,\nKatharine?\"\n\nShe could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of\nthe impression that her aunt had made on her. It seemed to her that the\nvery flowers were contaminated, and Cassandra s pocket-handkerchief,\nfor Mrs. Milvain had used them for evidence in her investigations.\n\n\"She s been spying upon us,\" she said, \"following us about London,\noverhearing what people are saying \"\n\n\"Mrs. Milvain?\" Rodney exclaimed. \"What has she told you?\"\n\nHis air of open confidence entirely vanished.\n\n\"Oh, people are saying that you re in love with Cassandra, and that you\ndon t care for me.\"\n\n\"They have seen us?\" he asked.\n\n\"Everything we ve done for a fortnight has been seen.\"\n\n\"I told you that would happen!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHe walked to the window in evident perturbation. Katharine was too\nindignant to attend to him. She was swept away by the force of her own\nanger. Clasping Rodney s flowers, she stood upright and motionless.\n\nRodney turned away from the window.\n\n\"It s all been a mistake,\" he said. \"I blame myself for it. I should\nhave known better. I let you persuade me in a moment of madness. I beg\nyou to forget my insanity, Katharine.\"\n\n\"She wished even to persecute Cassandra!\" Katharine burst out, not\nlistening to him. \"She threatened to speak to her. She s capable of\nit she s capable of anything!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Milvain is not tactful, I know, but you exaggerate, Katharine.\nPeople are talking about us. She was right to tell us. It only confirms\nmy own feeling the position is monstrous.\"\n\nAt length Katharine realized some part of what he meant.\n\n\"You don t mean that this influences you, William?\" she asked in\namazement.\n\n\"It does,\" he said, flushing. \"It s intensely disagreeable to me. I\ncan t endure that people should gossip about us. And then there s your\ncousin Cassandra \" He paused in embarrassment.\n\n\"I came here this morning, Katharine,\" he resumed, with a change of\nvoice, \"to ask you to forget my folly, my bad temper, my inconceivable\nbehavior. I came, Katharine, to ask whether we can t return to the\nposition we were in before this this season of lunacy. Will you take me\nback, Katharine, once more and for ever?\"\n\nNo doubt her beauty, intensified by emotion and enhanced by the flowers\nof bright color and strange shape which she carried wrought upon\nRodney, and had its share in bestowing upon her the old romance. But a\nless noble passion worked in him, too; he was inflamed by jealousy. His\ntentative offer of affection had been rudely and, as he thought,\ncompletely repulsed by Cassandra on the preceding day. Denham s\nconfession was in his mind. And ultimately, Katharine s dominion over\nhim was of the sort that the fevers of the night cannot exorcise.\n\n\"I was as much to blame as you were yesterday,\" she said gently,\ndisregarding his question. \"I confess, William, the sight of you and\nCassandra together made me jealous, and I couldn t control myself. I\nlaughed at you, I know.\"\n\n\"You jealous!\" William exclaimed. \"I assure you, Katharine, you ve not\nthe slightest reason to be jealous. Cassandra dislikes me, so far as\nshe feels about me at all. I was foolish enough to try to explain the\nnature of our relationship. I couldn t resist telling her what I\nsupposed myself to feel for her. She refused to listen, very rightly.\nBut she left me in no doubt of her scorn.\"\n\nKatharine hesitated. She was confused, agitated, physically tired, and\nhad already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by\nher aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings. She\nsank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap.\n\n\"She charmed me,\" Rodney continued. \"I thought I loved her. But that s\na thing of the past. It s all over, Katharine. It was a dream an\nhallucination. We were both equally to blame, but no harm s done if you\nbelieve how truly I care for you. Say you believe me!\"\n\nHe stood over her, as if in readiness to seize the first sign of her\nassent. Precisely at that moment, owing, perhaps, to her vicissitudes\nof feeling, all sense of love left her, as in a moment a mist lifts\nfrom the earth. And when the mist departed a skeleton world and\nblankness alone remained a terrible prospect for the eyes of the living\nto behold. He saw the look of terror in her face, and without\nunderstanding its origin, took her hand in his. With the sense of\ncompanionship returned a desire, like that of a child for shelter, to\naccept what he had to offer her and at that moment it seemed that he\noffered her the only thing that could make it tolerable to live. She\nlet him press his lips to her cheek, and leant her head upon his arm.\nIt was the moment of his triumph. It was the only moment in which she\nbelonged to him and was dependent upon his protection.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" he murmured, \"you accept me, Katharine. You love me.\"\n\nFor a moment she remained silent. He then heard her murmur:\n\n\"Cassandra loves you more than I do.\"\n\n\"Cassandra?\" he whispered.\n\n\"She loves you,\" Katharine repeated. She raised herself and repeated\nthe sentence yet a third time. \"She loves you.\"\n\nWilliam slowly raised himself. He believed instinctively what Katharine\nsaid, but what it meant to him he was unable to understand. Could\nCassandra love him? Could she have told Katharine that she loved him?\nThe desire to know the truth of this was urgent, unknown though the\nconsequences might be. The thrill of excitement associated with the\nthought of Cassandra once more took possession of him. No longer was it\nthe excitement of anticipation and ignorance; it was the excitement of\nsomething greater than a possibility, for now he knew her and had\nmeasure of the sympathy between them. But who could give him certainty?\nCould Katharine, Katharine who had lately lain in his arms, Katharine\nherself the most admired of women? He looked at her, with doubt, and\nwith anxiety, but said nothing.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, interpreting his wish for assurance, \"it s true.\nI know what she feels for you.\"\n\n\"She loves me?\"\n\nKatharine nodded.\n\n\"Ah, but who knows what I feel? How can I be sure of my feeling myself?\nTen minutes ago I asked you to marry me. I still wish it I don t know\nwhat I wish \"\n\nHe clenched his hands and turned away. He suddenly faced her and\ndemanded: \"Tell me what you feel for Denham.\"\n\n\"For Ralph Denham?\" she asked. \"Yes!\" she exclaimed, as if she had\nfound the answer to some momentarily perplexing question. \"You re\njealous of me, William; but you re not in love with me. I m jealous of\nyou. Therefore, for both our sakes, I say, speak to Cassandra at once.\"\n\nHe tried to compose himself. He walked up and down the room; he paused\nat the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor. Meanwhile\nhis desire to have Katharine s assurance confirmed became so insistent\nthat he could no longer deny the overmastering strength of his feeling\nfor Cassandra.\n\n\"You re right,\" he exclaimed, coming to a standstill and rapping his\nknuckles sharply upon a small table carrying one slender vase. \"I love\nCassandra.\"\n\nAs he said this, the curtains hanging at the door of the little room\nparted, and Cassandra herself stepped forth.\n\n\"I have overheard every word!\" she exclaimed.\n\nA pause succeeded this announcement. Rodney made a step forward and\nsaid:\n\n\"Then you know what I wish to ask you. Give me your answer \"\n\nShe put her hands before her face; she turned away and seemed to shrink\nfrom both of them.\n\n\"What Katharine said,\" she murmured. \"But,\" she added, raising her head\nwith a look of fear from the kiss with which he greeted her admission,\n\"how frightfully difficult it all is! Our feelings, I mean yours and\nmine and Katharine s. Katharine, tell me, are we doing right?\"\n\n\"Right of course we re doing right,\" William answered her, \"if, after\nwhat you ve heard, you can marry a man of such incomprehensible\nconfusion, such deplorable \"\n\n\"Don t, William,\" Katharine interposed; \"Cassandra has heard us; she\ncan judge what we are; she knows better than we could tell her.\"\n\nBut, still holding William s hand, questions and desires welled up in\nCassandra s heart. Had she done wrong in listening? Why did Aunt Celia\nblame her? Did Katharine think her right? Above all, did William really\nlove her, for ever and ever, better than any one?\n\n\"I must be first with him, Katharine!\" she exclaimed. \"I can t share\nhim even with you.\"\n\n\"I shall never ask that,\" said Katharine. She moved a little away from\nwhere they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers.\n\n\"But you ve shared with me,\" Cassandra said. \"Why can t I share with\nyou? Why am I so mean? I know why it is,\" she added. \"We understand\neach other, William and I. You ve never understood each other. You re\ntoo different.\"\n\n\"I ve never admired anybody more,\" William interposed.\n\n\"It s not that\" Cassandra tried to enlighten him \"it s understanding.\"\n\n\"Have I never understood you, Katharine? Have I been very selfish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Cassandra interposed. \"You ve asked her for sympathy, and she s\nnot sympathetic; you ve wanted her to be practical, and she s not\npractical. You ve been selfish; you ve been exacting and so has\nKatharine but it wasn t anybody s fault.\"\n\nKatharine had listened to this attempt at analysis with keen attention.\nCassandra s words seemed to rub the old blurred image of life and\nfreshen it so marvelously that it looked new again. She turned to\nWilliam.\n\n\"It s quite true,\" she said. \"It was nobody s fault.\"\n\n\"There are many things that he ll always come to you for,\" Cassandra\ncontinued, still reading from her invisible book. \"I accept that,\nKatharine. I shall never dispute it. I want to be generous as you ve\nbeen generous. But being in love makes it more difficult for me.\"\n\nThey were silent. At length William broke the silence.\n\n\"One thing I beg of you both,\" he said, and the old nervousness of\nmanner returned as he glanced at Katharine. \"We will never discuss\nthese matters again. It s not that I m timid and conventional, as you\nthink, Katharine. It s that it spoils things to discuss them; it\nunsettles people s minds; and now we re all so happy \"\n\nCassandra ratified this conclusion so far as she was concerned, and\nWilliam, after receiving the exquisite pleasure of her glance, with its\nabsolute affection and trust, looked anxiously at Katharine.\n\n\"Yes, I m happy,\" she assured him. \"And I agree. We will never talk\nabout it again.\"\n\n\"Oh, Katharine, Katharine!\" Cassandra cried, holding out her arms while\nthe tears ran down her cheeks.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXX\n\n\nThe day was so different from other days to three people in the house\nthat the common routine of household life the maid waiting at table,\nMrs. Hilbery writing a letter, the clock striking, and the door\nopening, and all the other signs of long-established civilization\nappeared suddenly to have no meaning save as they lulled Mr. and Mrs.\nHilbery into the belief that nothing unusual had taken place. It\nchanced that Mrs. Hilbery was depressed without visible cause, unless a\ncertain crudeness verging upon coarseness in the temper of her favorite\nElizabethans could be held responsible for the mood. At any rate, she\nhad shut up \"The Duchess of Malfi\" with a sigh, and wished to know, so\nshe told Rodney at dinner, whether there wasn t some young writer with\na touch of the great spirit somebody who made you believe that life was\n_beautiful?_ She got little help from Rodney, and after singing her\nplaintive requiem for the death of poetry by herself, she charmed\nherself into good spirits again by remembering the existence of Mozart.\nShe begged Cassandra to play to her, and when they went upstairs\nCassandra opened the piano directly, and did her best to create an\natmosphere of unmixed beauty. At the sound of the first notes Katharine\nand Rodney both felt an enormous sense of relief at the license which\nthe music gave them to loosen their hold upon the mechanism of\nbehavior. They lapsed into the depths of thought. Mrs. Hilbery was soon\nspirited away into a perfectly congenial mood, that was half reverie\nand half slumber, half delicious melancholy and half pure bliss. Mr.\nHilbery alone attended. He was extremely musical, and made Cassandra\naware that he listened to every note. She played her best, and won his\napproval. Leaning slightly forward in his chair, and turning his little\ngreen stone, he weighed the intention of her phrases approvingly, but\nstopped her suddenly to complain of a noise behind him. The window was\nunhasped. He signed to Rodney, who crossed the room immediately to put\nthe matter right. He stayed a moment longer by the window than was,\nperhaps, necessary, and having done what was needed, drew his chair a\nlittle closer than before to Katharine s side. The music went on. Under\ncover of some exquisite run of melody, he leant towards her and\nwhispered something. She glanced at her father and mother, and a moment\nlater left the room, almost unobserved, with Rodney.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, as soon as the door was shut.\n\nRodney made no answer, but led her downstairs into the dining-room on\nthe ground floor. Even when he had shut the door he said nothing, but\nwent straight to the window and parted the curtains. He beckoned to\nKatharine.\n\n\"There he is again,\" he said. \"Look, there under the lamp-post.\"\n\nKatharine looked. She had no idea what Rodney was talking about. A\nvague feeling of alarm and mystery possessed her. She saw a man\nstanding on the opposite side of the road facing the house beneath a\nlamp-post. As they looked the figure turned, walked a few steps, and\ncame back again to his old position. It seemed to her that he was\nlooking fixedly at her, and was conscious of her gaze on him. She knew,\nin a flash, who the man was who was watching them. She drew the curtain\nabruptly.\n\n\"Denham,\" said Rodney. \"He was there last night too.\" He spoke sternly.\nHis whole manner had become full of authority. Katharine felt almost as\nif he accused her of some crime. She was pale and uncomfortably\nagitated, as much by the strangeness of Rodney s behavior as by the\nsight of Ralph Denham.\n\n\"If he chooses to come \" she said defiantly.\n\n\"You can t let him wait out there. I shall tell him to come in.\" Rodney\nspoke with such decision that when he raised his arm Katharine expected\nhim to draw the curtain instantly. She caught his hand with a little\nexclamation.\n\n\"Wait!\" she cried. \"I don t allow you.\"\n\n\"You can t wait,\" he replied. \"You ve gone too far.\" His hand remained\nupon the curtain. \"Why don t you admit, Katharine,\" he broke out,\nlooking at her with an expression of contempt as well as of anger,\n\"that you love him? Are you going to treat him as you treated me?\"\n\nShe looked at him, wondering, in spite of all her perplexity, at the\nspirit that possessed him.\n\n\"I forbid you to draw the curtain,\" she said.\n\nHe reflected, and then took his hand away.\n\n\"I ve no right to interfere,\" he concluded. \"I ll leave you. Or, if you\nlike, we ll go back to the drawing-room.\"\n\n\"No. I can t go back,\" she said, shaking her head. She bent her head in\nthought.\n\n\"You love him, Katharine,\" Rodney said suddenly. His tone had lost\nsomething of its sternness, and might have been used to urge a child to\nconfess its fault. She raised her eyes and fixed them upon him.\n\n\"I love him?\" she repeated. He nodded. She searched his face, as if for\nfurther confirmation of his words, and, as he remained silent and\nexpectant, turned away once more and continued her thoughts. He\nobserved her closely, but without stirring, as if he gave her time to\nmake up her mind to fulfil her obvious duty. The strains of Mozart\nreached them from the room above.\n\n\"Now,\" she said suddenly, with a sort of desperation, rising from her\nchair and seeming to command Rodney to fulfil his part. He drew the\ncurtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. Their eyes at\nonce sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post.\n\n\"He s not there!\" she exclaimed.\n\nNo one was there. William threw the window up and looked out. The wind\nrushed into the room, together with the sound of distant wheels,\nfootsteps hurrying along the pavement, and the cries of sirens hooting\ndown the river.\n\n\"Denham!\" William cried.\n\n\"Ralph!\" said Katharine, but she spoke scarcely louder than she might\nhave spoken to some one in the same room. With their eyes fixed upon\nthe opposite side of the road, they did not notice a figure close to\nthe railing which divided the garden from the street. But Denham had\ncrossed the road and was standing there. They were startled by his\nvoice close at hand.\n\n\"Rodney!\"\n\n\"There you are! Come in, Denham.\" Rodney went to the front door and\nopened it. \"Here he is,\" he said, bringing Ralph with him into the\ndining-room where Katharine stood, with her back to the open window.\nTheir eyes met for a second. Denham looked half dazed by the strong\nlight, and, buttoned in his overcoat, with his hair ruffled across his\nforehead by the wind, he seemed like somebody rescued from an open boat\nout at sea. William promptly shut the window and drew the curtains. He\nacted with a cheerful decision as if he were master of the situation,\nand knew exactly what he meant to do.\n\n\"You re the first to hear the news, Denham,\" he said. \"Katharine isn t\ngoing to marry me, after all.\"\n\n\"Where shall I put \" Ralph began vaguely, holding out his hat and\nglancing about him; he balanced it carefully against a silver bowl that\nstood upon the sideboard. He then sat himself down rather heavily at\nthe head of the oval dinner-table. Rodney stood on one side of him and\nKatharine on the other. He appeared to be presiding over some meeting\nfrom which most of the members were absent. Meanwhile, he waited, and\nhis eyes rested upon the glow of the beautifully polished mahogany\ntable.\n\n\"William is engaged to Cassandra,\" said Katharine briefly.\n\nAt that Denham looked up quickly at Rodney. Rodney s expression\nchanged. He lost his self-possession. He smiled a little nervously, and\nthen his attention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the\nfloor above. He seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the\nothers. He glanced towards the door.\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" said Denham.\n\n\"Yes, yes. We re all mad quite out of our minds, Denham,\" he said.\n\"It s partly Katharine s doing partly mine.\" He looked oddly round the\nroom as if he wished to make sure that the scene in which he played a\npart had some real existence. \"Quite mad,\" he repeated. \"Even\nKatharine \" His gaze rested upon her finally, as if she, too, had\nchanged from his old view of her. He smiled at her as if to encourage\nher. \"Katharine shall explain,\" he said, and giving a little nod to\nDenham, he left the room.\n\nKatharine sat down at once, and leant her chin upon her hands. So long\nas Rodney was in the room the proceedings of the evening had seemed to\nbe in his charge, and had been marked by a certain unreality. Now that\nshe was alone with Ralph she felt at once that a constraint had been\ntaken from them both. She felt that they were alone at the bottom of\nthe house, which rose, story upon story, upon the top of them.\n\n\"Why were you waiting out there?\" she asked.\n\n\"For the chance of seeing you,\" he replied.\n\n\"You would have waited all night if it hadn t been for William. It s\nwindy too. You must have been cold. What could you see? Nothing but our\nwindows.\"\n\n\"It was worth it. I heard you call me.\"\n\n\"I called you?\" She had called unconsciously.\n\n\"They were engaged this morning,\" she told him, after a pause.\n\n\"You re glad?\" he asked.\n\nShe bent her head. \"Yes, yes,\" she sighed. \"But you don t know how good\nhe is what he s done for me \" Ralph made a sound of understanding. \"You\nwaited there last night too?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. I can wait,\" Denham replied.\n\nThe words seemed to fill the room with an emotion which Katharine\nconnected with the sound of distant wheels, the footsteps hurrying\nalong the pavement, the cries of sirens hooting down the river, the\ndarkness and the wind. She saw the upright figure standing beneath the\nlamp-post.\n\n\"Waiting in the dark,\" she said, glancing at the window, as if he saw\nwhat she was seeing. \"Ah, but it s different \" She broke off. \"I m not\nthe person you think me. Until you realize that it s impossible \"\n\nPlacing her elbows on the table, she slid her ruby ring up and down her\nfinger abstractedly. She frowned at the rows of leather-bound books\nopposite her. Ralph looked keenly at her. Very pale, but sternly\nconcentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself\nas to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and\nabstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.\n\n\"No, you re right,\" he said. \"I don t know you. I ve never known you.\"\n\n\"Yet perhaps you know me better than any one else,\" she mused.\n\nSome detached instinct made her aware that she was gazing at a book\nwhich belonged by rights to some other part of the house. She walked\nover to the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing the\nbook on the table between them. Ralph opened it and looked at the\nportrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed\nthe frontispiece.\n\n\"I say I do know you, Katharine,\" he affirmed, shutting the book. \"It s\nonly for moments that I go mad.\"\n\n\"Do you call two whole nights a moment?\"\n\n\"I swear to you that now, at this instant, I see you precisely as you\nare. No one has ever known you as I know you.... Could you have taken\ndown that book just now if I hadn t known you?\"\n\n\"That s true,\" she replied, \"but you can t think how I m divided how\nI m at my ease with you, and how I m bewildered. The unreality the\ndark the waiting outside in the wind yes, when you look at me, not\nseeing me, and I don t see you either.... But I do see,\" she went on\nquickly, changing her position and frowning again, \"heaps of things,\nonly not you.\"\n\n\"Tell me what you see,\" he urged.\n\nBut she could not reduce her vision to words, since it was no single\nshape colored upon the dark, but rather a general excitement, an\natmosphere, which, when she tried to visualize it, took form as a wind\nscouring the flanks of northern hills and flashing light upon\ncornfields and pools.\n\n\"Impossible,\" she sighed, laughing at the ridiculous notion of putting\nany part of this into words.\n\n\"Try, Katharine,\" Ralph urged her.\n\n\"But I can t I m talking a sort of nonsense the sort of nonsense one\ntalks to oneself.\" She was dismayed by the expression of longing and\ndespair upon his face. \"I was thinking about a mountain in the North of\nEngland,\" she attempted. \"It s too silly I won t go on.\"\n\n\"We were there together?\" he pressed her.\n\n\"No. I was alone.\" She seemed to be disappointing the desire of a\nchild. His face fell.\n\n\"You re always alone there?\"\n\n\"I can t explain.\" She could not explain that she was essentially alone\nthere. \"It s not a mountain in the North of England. It s an\nimagination a story one tells oneself. You have yours too?\"\n\n\"You re with me in mine. You re the thing I make up, you see.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" she sighed. \"That s why it s so impossible.\" She turned\nupon him almost fiercely. \"You must try to stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"I won t,\" he replied roughly, \"because I \" He stopped. He realized\nthat the moment had come to impart that news of the utmost importance\nwhich he had tried to impart to Mary Datchet, to Rodney upon the\nEmbankment, to the drunken tramp upon the seat. How should he offer it\nto Katharine? He looked quickly at her. He saw that she was only half\nattentive to him; only a section of her was exposed to him. The sight\nroused in him such desperation that he had much ado to control his\nimpulse to rise and leave the house. Her hand lay loosely curled upon\nthe table. He seized it and grasped it firmly as if to make sure of her\nexistence and of his own. \"Because I love you, Katharine,\" he said.\n\nSome roundness or warmth essential to that statement was absent from\nhis voice, and she had merely to shake her head very slightly for him\nto drop her hand and turn away in shame at his own impotence. He\nthought that she had detected his wish to leave her. She had discerned\nthe break in his resolution, the blankness in the heart of his vision.\nIt was true that he had been happier out in the street, thinking of\nher, than now that he was in the same room with her. He looked at her\nwith a guilty expression on his face. But her look expressed neither\ndisappointment nor reproach. Her pose was easy, and she seemed to give\neffect to a mood of quiet speculation by the spinning of her ruby ring\nupon the polished table. Denham forgot his despair in wondering what\nthoughts now occupied her.\n\n\"You don t believe me?\" he said. His tone was humble, and made her\nsmile at him.\n\n\"As far as I understand you but what should you advise me to do with\nthis ring?\" she asked, holding it out.\n\n\"I should advise you to let me keep it for you,\" he replied, in the\nsame tone of half-humorous gravity.\n\n\"After what you ve said, I can hardly trust you unless you ll unsay\nwhat you ve said?\"\n\n\"Very well. I m not in love with you.\"\n\n\"But I think you _are_ in love with me.... As I am with you,\" she added\ncasually enough. \"At least,\" she said slipping her ring back to its old\nposition, \"what other word describes the state we re in?\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely and inquiringly, as if in search of help.\n\n\"It s when I m with you that I doubt it, not when I m alone,\" he\nstated.\n\n\"So I thought,\" she replied.\n\nIn order to explain to her his state of mind, Ralph recounted his\nexperience with the photograph, the letter, and the flower picked at\nKew. She listened very seriously.\n\n\"And then you went raving about the streets,\" she mused. \"Well, it s\nbad enough. But my state is worse than yours, because it hasn t\nanything to do with facts. It s an hallucination, pure and simple an\nintoxication.... One can be in love with pure reason?\" she hazarded.\n\"Because if you re in love with a vision, I believe that that s what\nI m in love with.\"\n\nThis conclusion seemed fantastic and profoundly unsatisfactory to\nRalph, but after the astonishing variations of his own sentiments\nduring the past half-hour he could not accuse her of fanciful\nexaggeration.\n\n\"Rodney seems to know his own mind well enough,\" he said almost\nbitterly. The music, which had ceased, had now begun again, and the\nmelody of Mozart seemed to express the easy and exquisite love of the\ntwo upstairs.\n\n\"Cassandra never doubted for a moment. But we \" she glanced at him as\nif to ascertain his position, \"we see each other only now and then \"\n\n\"Like lights in a storm \"\n\n\"In the midst of a hurricane,\" she concluded, as the window shook\nbeneath the pressure of the wind. They listened to the sound in\nsilence.\n\nHere the door opened with considerable hesitation, and Mrs. Hilbery s\nhead appeared, at first with an air of caution, but having made sure\nthat she had admitted herself to the dining-room and not to some more\nunusual region, she came completely inside and seemed in no way taken\naback by the sight she saw. She seemed, as usual, bound on some quest\nof her own which was interrupted pleasantly but strangely by running\ninto one of those queer, unnecessary ceremonies that other people\nthought fit to indulge in.\n\n\"Please don t let me interrupt you, Mr. \" she was at a loss, as usual,\nfor the name, and Katharine thought that she did not recognize him. \"I\nhope you ve found something nice to read,\" she added, pointing to the\nbook upon the table. \"Byron ah, Byron. I ve known people who knew Lord\nByron,\" she said.\n\nKatharine, who had risen in some confusion, could not help smiling at\nthe thought that her mother found it perfectly natural and desirable\nthat her daughter should be reading Byron in the dining-room late at\nnight alone with a strange young man. She blessed a disposition that\nwas so convenient, and felt tenderly towards her mother and her\nmother s eccentricities. But Ralph observed that although Mrs. Hilbery\nheld the book so close to her eyes she was not reading a word.\n\n\"My dear mother, why aren t you in bed?\" Katharine exclaimed, changing\nastonishingly in the space of a minute to her usual condition of\nauthoritative good sense. \"Why are you wandering about?\"\n\n\"I m sure I should like your poetry better than I like Lord Byron s,\"\nsaid Mrs. Hilbery, addressing Ralph Denham.\n\n\"Mr. Denham doesn t write poetry; he has written articles for father,\nfor the Review,\" Katharine said, as if prompting her memory.\n\n\"Oh dear! How dull!\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed, with a sudden laugh that\nrather puzzled her daughter.\n\nRalph found that she had turned upon him a gaze that was at once very\nvague and very penetrating.\n\n\"But I m sure you read poetry at night. I always judge by the\nexpression of the eyes,\" Mrs. Hilbery continued. (\"The windows of the\nsoul,\" she added parenthetically.) \"I don t know much about the law,\"\nshe went on, \"though many of my relations were lawyers. Some of them\nlooked very handsome, too, in their wigs. But I think I do know a\nlittle about poetry,\" she added. \"And all the things that aren t\nwritten down, but but \" She waved her hand, as if to indicate the\nwealth of unwritten poetry all about them. \"The night and the stars,\nthe dawn coming up, the barges swimming past, the sun setting.... Ah\ndear,\" she sighed, \"well, the sunset is very lovely too. I sometimes\nthink that poetry isn t so much what we write as what we feel, Mr.\nDenham.\"\n\nDuring this speech of her mother s Katharine had turned away, and Ralph\nfelt that Mrs. Hilbery was talking to him apart, with a desire to\nascertain something about him which she veiled purposely by the\nvagueness of her words. He felt curiously encouraged and heartened by\nthe beam in her eye rather than by her actual words. From the distance\nof her age and sex she seemed to be waving to him, hailing him as a\nship sinking beneath the horizon might wave its flag of greeting to\nanother setting out upon the same voyage. He bent his head, saying\nnothing, but with a curious certainty that she had read an answer to\nher inquiry that satisfied her. At any rate, she rambled off into a\ndescription of the Law Courts which turned to a denunciation of English\njustice, which, according to her, imprisoned poor men who couldn t pay\ntheir debts. \"Tell me, shall we ever do without it all?\" she asked, but\nat this point Katharine gently insisted that her mother should go to\nbed. Looking back from half-way up the staircase, Katharine seemed to\nsee Denham s eyes watching her steadily and intently with an expression\nthat she had guessed in them when he stood looking at the windows\nacross the road.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXI\n\n\nThe tray which brought Katharine s cup of tea the next morning brought,\nalso, a note from her mother, announcing that it was her intention to\ncatch an early train to Stratford-on-Avon that very day.\n\n\"Please find out the best way of getting there,\" the note ran, \"and\nwire to dear Sir John Burdett to expect me, with my love. I ve been\ndreaming all night of you and Shakespeare, dearest Katharine.\"\n\nThis was no momentary impulse. Mrs. Hilbery had been dreaming of\nShakespeare any time these six months, toying with the idea of an\nexcursion to what she considered the heart of the civilized world. To\nstand six feet above Shakespeare s bones, to see the very stones worn\nby his feet, to reflect that the oldest man s oldest mother had very\nlikely seen Shakespeare s daughter such thoughts roused an emotion in\nher, which she expressed at unsuitable moments, and with a passion that\nwould not have been unseemly in a pilgrim to a sacred shrine. The only\nstrange thing was that she wished to go by herself. But, naturally\nenough, she was well provided with friends who lived in the\nneighborhood of Shakespeare s tomb, and were delighted to welcome her;\nand she left later to catch her train in the best of spirits. There was\na man selling violets in the street. It was a fine day. She would\nremember to send Mr. Hilbery the first daffodil she saw. And, as she\nran back into the hall to tell Katharine, she felt, she had always\nfelt, that Shakespeare s command to leave his bones undisturbed applied\nonly to odious curiosity-mongers not to dear Sir John and herself.\nLeaving her daughter to cogitate the theory of Anne Hathaway s sonnets,\nand the buried manuscripts here referred to, with the implied menace to\nthe safety of the heart of civilization itself, she briskly shut the\ndoor of her taxi-cab, and was whirled off upon the first stage of her\npilgrimage.\n\nThe house was oddly different without her. Katharine found the maids\nalready in possession of her room, which they meant to clean thoroughly\nduring her absence. To Katharine it seemed as if they had brushed away\nsixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters. It seemed\nto her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept\ninto a very insignificant heap of dust. The china shepherdesses were\nalready shining from a bath of hot water. The writing-table might have\nbelonged to a professional man of methodical habits.\n\nGathering together a few papers upon which she was at work, Katharine\nproceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through them,\nperhaps, in the course of the morning. But she was met on the stairs by\nCassandra, who followed her up, but with such intervals between each\nstep that Katharine began to feel her purpose dwindling before they had\nreached the door. Cassandra leant over the banisters, and looked down\nupon the Persian rug that lay on the floor of the hall.\n\n\"Doesn t everything look odd this morning?\" she inquired. \"Are you\nreally going to spend the morning with those dull old letters, because\nif so \"\n\nThe dull old letters, which would have turned the heads of the most\nsober of collectors, were laid upon a table, and, after a moment s\npause, Cassandra, looking grave all of a sudden, asked Katharine where\nshe should find the \"History of England\" by Lord Macaulay. It was\ndownstairs in Mr. Hilbery s study. The cousins descended together in\nsearch of it. They diverged into the drawing-room for the good reason\nthat the door was open. The portrait of Richard Alardyce attracted\ntheir attention.\n\n\"I wonder what he was like?\" It was a question that Katharine had often\nasked herself lately.\n\n\"Oh, a fraud like the rest of them at least Henry says so,\" Cassandra\nreplied. \"Though I don t believe everything Henry says,\" she added a\nlittle defensively.\n\nDown they went into Mr. Hilbery s study, where they began to look among\nhis books. So desultory was this examination that some fifteen minutes\nfailed to discover the work they were in search of.\n\n\"Must you read Macaulay s History, Cassandra?\" Katharine asked, with a\nstretch of her arms.\n\n\"I must,\" Cassandra replied briefly.\n\n\"Well, I m going to leave you to look for it by yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Katharine. Please stay and help me. You see you see I told\nWilliam I d read a little every day. And I want to tell him that I ve\nbegun when he comes.\"\n\n\"When does William come?\" Katharine asked, turning to the shelves\nagain.\n\n\"To tea, if that suits you?\"\n\n\"If it suits me to be out, I suppose you mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, you re horrid.... Why shouldn t you ?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn t you be happy too?\"\n\n\"I am quite happy,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"I mean as I am. Katharine,\" she said impulsively, \"do let s be married\non the same day.\"\n\n\"To the same man?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no. But why shouldn t you marry some one else?\"\n\n\"Here s your Macaulay,\" said Katharine, turning round with the book in\nher hand. \"I should say you d better begin to read at once if you mean\nto be educated by tea-time.\"\n\n\"Damn Lord Macaulay!\" cried Cassandra, slapping the book upon the\ntable. \"Would you rather not talk?\"\n\n\"We ve talked enough already,\" Katharine replied evasively.\n\n\"I know I shan t be able to settle to Macaulay,\" said Cassandra,\nlooking ruefully at the dull red cover of the prescribed volume, which,\nhowever, possessed a talismanic property, since William admired it. He\nhad advised a little serious reading for the morning hours.\n\n\"Have _you_ read Macaulay?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. William never tried to educate me.\" As she spoke she saw the light\nfade from Cassandra s face, as if she had implied some other, more\nmysterious, relationship. She was stung with compunction. She marveled\nat her own rashness in having influenced the life of another, as she\nhad influenced Cassandra s life.\n\n\"We weren t serious,\" she said quickly.\n\n\"But I m fearfully serious,\" said Cassandra, with a little shudder, and\nher look showed that she spoke the truth. She turned and glanced at\nKatharine as she had never glanced at her before. There was fear in her\nglance, which darted on her and then dropped guiltily. Oh, Katharine\nhad everything beauty, mind, character. She could never compete with\nKatharine; she could never be safe so long as Katharine brooded over\nher, dominating her, disposing of her. She called her cold, unseeing,\nunscrupulous, but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious\none she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history. At that\nmoment the bell of the telephone rang and Katharine went to answer it.\nCassandra, released from observation, dropped her book and clenched her\nhands. She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she\nhad suffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her\ncapacities for feeling. But when Katharine reappeared she was calm, and\nhad gained a look of dignity that was new to her.\n\n\"Was that him?\" she asked.\n\n\"It was Ralph Denham,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"I meant Ralph Denham.\"\n\n\"Why did you mean Ralph Denham? What has William told you about Ralph\nDenham?\" The accusation that Katharine was calm, callous, and\nindifferent was not possible in face of her present air of animation.\nShe gave Cassandra no time to frame an answer. \"Now, when are you and\nWilliam going to be married?\" she asked.\n\nCassandra made no reply for some moments. It was, indeed, a very\ndifficult question to answer. In conversation the night before, William\nhad indicated to Cassandra that, in his belief, Katharine was becoming\nengaged to Ralph Denham in the dining-room. Cassandra, in the rosy\nlight of her own circumstances, had been disposed to think that the\nmatter must be settled already. But a letter which she had received\nthat morning from William, while ardent in its expression of affection,\nhad conveyed to her obliquely that he would prefer the announcement of\ntheir engagement to coincide with that of Katharine s. This document\nCassandra now produced, and read aloud, with considerable excisions and\nmuch hesitation.\n\n\"... a thousand pities ahem I fear we shall cause a great deal of\nnatural annoyance. If, on the other hand, what I have reason to think\nwill happen, should happen within reasonable time, and the present\nposition is not in any way offensive to you, delay would, in my\nopinion, serve all our interests better than a premature explanation,\nwhich is bound to cause more surprise than is desirable \"\n\n\"Very like William,\" Katharine exclaimed, having gathered the drift of\nthese remarks with a speed that, by itself, disconcerted Cassandra.\n\n\"I quite understand his feelings,\" Cassandra replied. \"I quite agree\nwith them. I think it would be much better, if you intend to marry Mr.\nDenham, that we should wait as William says.\"\n\n\"But, then, if I don t marry him for months or, perhaps, not at all?\"\n\nCassandra was silent. The prospect appalled her. Katharine had been\ntelephoning to Ralph Denham; she looked queer, too; she must be, or\nabout to become, engaged to him. But if Cassandra could have overheard\nthe conversation upon the telephone, she would not have felt so certain\nthat it tended in that direction. It was to this effect:\n\n\"I m Ralph Denham speaking. I m in my right senses now.\"\n\n\"How long did you wait outside the house?\"\n\n\"I went home and wrote you a letter. I tore it up.\"\n\n\"I shall tear up everything too.\"\n\n\"I shall come.\"\n\n\"Yes. Come to-day.\"\n\n\"I must explain to you \"\n\n\"Yes. We must explain \"\n\nA long pause followed. Ralph began a sentence, which he canceled with\nthe word, \"Nothing.\" Suddenly, together, at the same moment, they said\ngood-bye. And yet, if the telephone had been miraculously connected\nwith some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the\nsavor of salt, Katharine could hardly have breathed in a keener sense\nof exhilaration. She ran downstairs on the crest of it. She was amazed\nto find herself already committed by William and Cassandra to marry the\nowner of the halting voice she had just heard on the telephone. The\ntendency of her spirit seemed to be in an altogether different\ndirection; and of a different nature. She had only to look at Cassandra\nto see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means.\nShe considered for a moment, and then said: \"If you don t want to tell\npeople yourselves, I ll do it for you. I know William has feelings\nabout these matters that make it very difficult for him to do\nanything.\"\n\n\"Because he s fearfully sensitive about other people s feelings,\" said\nCassandra. \"The idea that he could upset Aunt Maggie or Uncle Trevor\nwould make him ill for weeks.\"\n\nThis interpretation of what she was used to call William s\nconventionality was new to Katharine. And yet she felt it now to be the\ntrue one.\n\n\"Yes, you re right,\" she said.\n\n\"And then he worships beauty. He wants life to be beautiful in every\npart of it. Have you ever noticed how exquisitely he finishes\neverything? Look at the address on that envelope. Every letter is\nperfect.\"\n\nWhether this applied also to the sentiments expressed in the letter,\nKatharine was not so sure; but when William s solicitude was spent upon\nCassandra it not only failed to irritate her, as it had done when she\nwas the object of it, but appeared, as Cassandra said, the fruit of his\nlove of beauty.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"he loves beauty.\"\n\n\"I hope we shall have a great many children,\" said Cassandra. \"He loves\nchildren.\"\n\nThis remark made Katharine realize the depths of their intimacy better\nthan any other words could have done; she was jealous for one moment;\nbut the next she was humiliated. She had known William for years, and\nshe had never once guessed that he loved children. She looked at the\nqueer glow of exaltation in Cassandra s eyes, through which she was\nbeholding the true spirit of a human being, and wished that she would\ngo on talking about William for ever. Cassandra was not unwilling to\ngratify her. She talked on. The morning slipped away. Katharine\nscarcely changed her position on the edge of her father s\nwriting-table, and Cassandra never opened the \"History of England.\"\n\nAnd yet it must be confessed that there were vast lapses in the\nattention which Katharine bestowed upon her cousin. The atmosphere was\nwonderfully congenial for thoughts of her own. She lost herself\nsometimes in such deep reverie that Cassandra, pausing, could look at\nher for moments unperceived. What could Katharine be thinking about,\nunless it were Ralph Denham? She was satisfied, by certain random\nreplies, that Katharine had wandered a little from the subject of\nWilliam s perfections. But Katharine made no sign. She always ended\nthese pauses by saying something so natural that Cassandra was deluded\ninto giving fresh examples of her absorbing theme. Then they lunched,\nand the only sign that Katharine gave of abstraction was to forget to\nhelp the pudding. She looked so like her mother, as she sat there\noblivious of the tapioca, that Cassandra was startled into exclaiming:\n\n\"How like Aunt Maggie you look!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Katharine, with more irritation than the remark seemed\nto call for.\n\nIn truth, now that her mother was away, Katharine did feel less\nsensible than usual, but as she argued it to herself, there was much\nless need for sense. Secretly, she was a little shaken by the evidence\nwhich the morning had supplied of her immense capacity for what could\none call it? rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were\ntoo foolish to be named. She was, for example, walking down a road in\nNorthumberland in the August sunset; at the inn she left her companion,\nwho was Ralph Denham, and was transported, not so much by her own feet\nas by some invisible means, to the top of a high hill. Here the scents,\nthe sounds among the dry heather-roots, the grass-blades pressed upon\nthe palm of her hand, were all so perceptible that she could experience\neach one separately. After this her mind made excursions into the dark\nof the air, or settled upon the surface of the sea, which could be\ndiscovered over there, or with equal unreason it returned to its couch\nof bracken beneath the stars of midnight, and visited the snow valleys\nof the moon. These fancies would have been in no way strange, since the\nwalls of every mind are decorated with some such tracery, but she found\nherself suddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardor, which\nbecame a desire to change her actual condition for something matching\nthe conditions of her dream. Then she started; then she awoke to the\nfact that Cassandra was looking at her in amazement.\n\nCassandra would have liked to feel certain that, when Katharine made no\nreply at all or one wide of the mark, she was making up her mind to get\nmarried at once, but it was difficult, if this were so, to account for\nsome remarks that Katharine let fall about the future. She recurred\nseveral times to the summer, as if she meant to spend that season in\nsolitary wandering. She seemed to have a plan in her mind which\nrequired Bradshaws and the names of inns.\n\nCassandra was driven finally, by her own unrest, to put on her clothes\nand wander out along the streets of Chelsea, on the pretence that she\nmust buy something. But, in her ignorance of the way, she became\npanic-stricken at the thought of being late, and no sooner had she\nfound the shop she wanted, than she fled back again in order to be at\nhome when William came. He came, indeed, five minutes after she had sat\ndown by the tea-table, and she had the happiness of receiving him\nalone. His greeting put her doubts of his affection at rest, but the\nfirst question he asked was:\n\n\"Has Katharine spoken to you?\"\n\n\"Yes. But she says she s not engaged. She doesn t seem to think she s\never going to be engaged.\"\n\nWilliam frowned, and looked annoyed.\n\n\"They telephoned this morning, and she behaves very oddly. She forgets\nto help the pudding,\" Cassandra added by way of cheering him.\n\n\"My dear child, after what I saw and heard last night, it s not a\nquestion of guessing or suspecting. Either she s engaged to him or \"\n\nHe left his sentence unfinished, for at this point Katharine herself\nappeared. With his recollections of the scene the night before, he was\ntoo self-conscious even to look at her, and it was not until she told\nhim of her mother s visit to Stratford-on-Avon that he raised his eyes.\nIt was clear that he was greatly relieved. He looked round him now, as\nif he felt at his ease, and Cassandra exclaimed:\n\n\"Don t you think everything looks quite different?\"\n\n\"You ve moved the sofa?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. Nothing s been touched,\" said Katharine. \"Everything s exactly the\nsame.\" But as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it\nimply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup into\nwhich she had forgotten to pour any tea. Being told of her\nforgetfulness, she frowned with annoyance, and said that Cassandra was\ndemoralizing her. The glance she cast upon them, and the resolute way\nin which she plunged them into speech, made William and Cassandra feel\nlike children who had been caught prying. They followed her obediently,\nmaking conversation. Any one coming in might have judged them\nacquaintances met, perhaps, for the third time. If that were so, one\nmust have concluded that the hostess suddenly bethought her of an\nengagement pressing for fulfilment. First Katharine looked at her\nwatch, and then she asked William to tell her the right time. When told\nthat it was ten minutes to five she rose at once, and said:\n\n\"Then I m afraid I must go.\"\n\nShe left the room, holding her unfinished bread and butter in her hand.\nWilliam glanced at Cassandra.\n\n\"Well, she IS queer!\" Cassandra exclaimed.\n\nWilliam looked perturbed. He knew more of Katharine than Cassandra did,\nbut even he could not tell . In a second Katharine was back again\ndressed in outdoor things, still holding her bread and butter in her\nbare hand.\n\n\"If I m late, don t wait for me,\" she said. \"I shall have dined,\" and\nso saying, she left them.\n\n\"But she can t \" William exclaimed, as the door shut, \"not without any\ngloves and bread and butter in her hand!\" They ran to the window, and\nsaw her walking rapidly along the street towards the City. Then she\nvanished.\n\n\"She must have gone to meet Mr. Denham,\" Cassandra exclaimed.\n\n\"Goodness knows!\" William interjected.\n\nThe incident impressed them both as having something queer and ominous\nabout it out of all proportion to its surface strangeness.\n\n\"It s the sort of way Aunt Maggie behaves,\" said Cassandra, as if in\nexplanation.\n\nWilliam shook his head, and paced up and down the room looking\nextremely perturbed.\n\n\"This is what I ve been foretelling,\" he burst out. \"Once set the\nordinary conventions aside Thank Heaven Mrs. Hilbery is away. But\nthere s Mr. Hilbery. How are we to explain it to him? I shall have to\nleave you.\"\n\n\"But Uncle Trevor won t be back for hours, William!\" Cassandra\nimplored.\n\n\"You never can tell. He may be on his way already. Or suppose Mrs.\nMilvain your Aunt Celia or Mrs. Cosham, or any other of your aunts or\nuncles should be shown in and find us alone together. You know what\nthey re saying about us already.\"\n\nCassandra was equally stricken by the sight of William s agitation, and\nappalled by the prospect of his desertion.\n\n\"We might hide,\" she exclaimed wildly, glancing at the curtain which\nseparated the room with the relics.\n\n\"I refuse entirely to get under the table,\" said William sarcastically.\n\nShe saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of the\nsituation. Her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection, at\nthis moment, would be extremely ill-judged. She controlled herself, sat\ndown, poured out a fresh cup of tea, and sipped it quietly. This\nnatural action, arguing complete self-mastery, and showing her in one\nof those feminine attitudes which William found adorable, did more than\nany argument to compose his agitation. It appealed to his chivalry. He\naccepted a cup. Next she asked for a slice of cake. By the time the\ncake was eaten and the tea drunk the personal question had lapsed, and\nthey were discussing poetry. Insensibly they turned from the question\nof dramatic poetry in general, to the particular example which reposed\nin William s pocket, and when the maid came in to clear away the\ntea-things, William had asked permission to read a short passage aloud,\n\"unless it bored her?\"\n\nCassandra bent her head in silence, but she showed a little of what she\nfelt in her eyes, and thus fortified, William felt confident that it\nwould take more than Mrs. Milvain herself to rout him from his\nposition. He read aloud.\n\nMeanwhile Katharine walked rapidly along the street. If called upon to\nexplain her impulsive action in leaving the tea-table, she could have\ntraced it to no better cause than that William had glanced at\nCassandra; Cassandra at William. Yet, because they had glanced, her\nposition was impossible. If one forgot to pour out a cup of tea they\nrushed to the conclusion that she was engaged to Ralph Denham. She knew\nthat in half an hour or so the door would open, and Ralph Denham would\nappear. She could not sit there and contemplate seeing him with\nWilliam s and Cassandra s eyes upon them, judging their exact degree of\nintimacy, so that they might fix the wedding-day. She promptly decided\nthat she would meet Ralph out of doors; she still had time to reach\nLincoln s Inn Fields before he left his office. She hailed a cab, and\nbade it take her to a shop for selling maps which she remembered in\nGreat Queen Street, since she hardly liked to be set down at his door.\nArrived at the shop, she bought a large scale map of Norfolk, and thus\nprovided, hurried into Lincoln s Inn Fields, and assured herself of the\nposition of Messrs. Hoper and Grateley s office. The great gas\nchandeliers were alight in the office windows. She conceived that he\nsat at an enormous table laden with papers beneath one of them in the\nfront room with the three tall windows. Having settled his position\nthere, she began walking to and fro upon the pavement. Nobody of his\nbuild appeared. She scrutinized each male figure as it approached and\npassed her. Each male figure had, nevertheless, a look of him, due,\nperhaps, to the professional dress, the quick step, the keen glance\nwhich they cast upon her as they hastened home after the day s work.\nThe square itself, with its immense houses all so fully occupied and\nstern of aspect, its atmosphere of industry and power, as if even the\nsparrows and the children were earning their daily bread, as if the sky\nitself, with its gray and scarlet clouds, reflected the serious\nintention of the city beneath it, spoke of him. Here was the fit place\nfor their meeting, she thought; here was the fit place for her to walk\nthinking of him. She could not help comparing it with the domestic\nstreets of Chelsea. With this comparison in her mind, she extended her\nrange a little, and turned into the main road. The great torrent of\nvans and carts was sweeping down Kingsway; pedestrians were streaming\nin two currents along the pavements. She stood fascinated at the\ncorner. The deep roar filled her ears; the changing tumult had the\ninexpressible fascination of varied life pouring ceaselessly with a\npurpose which, as she looked, seemed to her, somehow, the normal\npurpose for which life was framed; its complete indifference to the\nindividuals, whom it swallowed up and rolled onwards, filled her with\nat least a temporary exaltation. The blend of daylight and of lamplight\nmade her an invisible spectator, just as it gave the people who passed\nher a semi-transparent quality, and left the faces pale ivory ovals in\nwhich the eyes alone were dark. They tended the enormous rush of the\ncurrent the great flow, the deep stream, the unquenchable tide. She\nstood unobserved and absorbed, glorying openly in the rapture that had\nrun subterraneously all day. Suddenly she was clutched, unwilling, from\nthe outside, by the recollection of her purpose in coming there. She\nhad come to find Ralph Denham. She hastily turned back into Lincoln s\nInn Fields, and looked for her landmark the light in the three tall\nwindows. She sought in vain. The faces of the houses had now merged in\nthe general darkness, and she had difficulty in determining which she\nsought. Ralph s three windows gave back on their ghostly glass panels\nonly a reflection of the gray and greenish sky. She rang the bell,\nperemptorily, under the painted name of the firm. After some delay she\nwas answered by a caretaker, whose pail and brush of themselves told\nher that the working day was over and the workers gone. Nobody, save\nperhaps Mr. Grateley himself, was left, she assured Katharine; every\none else had been gone these ten minutes.\n\nThe news woke Katharine completely. Anxiety gained upon her. She\nhastened back into Kingsway, looking at people who had miraculously\nregained their solidity. She ran as far as the Tube station,\noverhauling clerk after clerk, solicitor after solicitor. Not one of\nthem even faintly resembled Ralph Denham. More and more plainly did she\nsee him; and more and more did he seem to her unlike any one else. At\nthe door of the station she paused, and tried to collect her thoughts.\nHe had gone to her house. By taking a cab she could be there probably\nin advance of him. But she pictured herself opening the drawing-room\ndoor, and William and Cassandra looking up, and Ralph s entrance a\nmoment later, and the glances the insinuations. No; she could not face\nit. She would write him a letter and take it at once to his house. She\nbought paper and pencil at the bookstall, and entered an A.B.C. shop,\nwhere, by ordering a cup of coffee, she secured an empty table, and\nbegan at vice to write:\n\n\"I came to meet you and I have missed you. I could not face William and\nCassandra. They want us \" here she paused. \"They insist that we are\nengaged,\" she substituted, \"and we couldn t talk at all, or explain\nanything. I want \" Her wants were so vast, now that she was in\ncommunication with Ralph, that the pencil was utterly inadequate to\nconduct them on to the paper; it seemed as if the whole torrent of\nKingsway had to run down her pencil. She gazed intently at a notice\nhanging on the gold-encrusted wall opposite, \"... to say all kinds of\nthings,\" she added, writing each word with the painstaking of a child.\nBut, when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence, she\nwas aware of a waitress, whose expression intimated that it was closing\ntime, and, looking round, Katharine saw herself almost the last person\nleft in the shop. She took up her letter, paid her bill, and found\nherself once more in the street. She would now take a cab to Highgate.\nBut at that moment it flashed upon her that she could not remember the\naddress. This check seemed to let fall a barrier across a very powerful\ncurrent of desire. She ransacked her memory in desperation, hunting for\nthe name, first by remembering the look of the house, and then by\ntrying, in memory, to retrace the words she had written once, at least,\nupon an envelope. The more she pressed the farther the words receded.\nWas the house an Orchard Something, on the street a Hill? She gave it\nup. Never, since she was a child, had she felt anything like this\nblankness and desolation. There rushed in upon her, as if she were\nwaking from some dream, all the consequences of her inexplicable\nindolence. She figured Ralph s face as he turned from her door without\na word of explanation, receiving his dismissal as a blow from herself,\na callous intimation that she did not wish to see him. She followed his\ndeparture from her door; but it was far more easy to see him marching\nfar and fast in any direction for any length of time than to conceive\nthat he would turn back to Highgate. Perhaps he would try once more to\nsee her in Cheyne Walk? It was proof of the clearness with which she\nsaw him, that she started forward as this possibility occurred to her,\nand almost raised her hand to beckon to a cab. No; he was too proud to\ncome again; he rejected the desire and walked on and on, on and on If\nonly she could read the names of those visionary streets down which he\npassed! But her imagination betrayed her at this point, or mocked her\nwith a sense of their strangeness, darkness, and distance. Indeed,\ninstead of helping herself to any decision, she only filled her mind\nwith the vast extent of London and the impossibility of finding any\nsingle figure that wandered off this way and that way, turned to the\nright and to the left, chose that dingy little back street where the\nchildren were playing in the road, and so She roused herself\nimpatiently. She walked rapidly along Holborn. Soon she turned and\nwalked as rapidly in the other direction. This indecision was not\nmerely odious, but had something that alarmed her about it, as she had\nbeen alarmed slightly once or twice already that day; she felt unable\nto cope with the strength of her own desires. To a person controlled by\nhabit, there was humiliation as well as alarm in this sudden release of\nwhat appeared to be a very powerful as well as an unreasonable force.\nAn aching in the muscles of her right hand now showed her that she was\ncrushing her gloves and the map of Norfolk in a grip sufficient to\ncrack a more solid object. She relaxed her grasp; she looked anxiously\nat the faces of the passers-by to see whether their eyes rested on her\nfor a moment longer than was natural, or with any curiosity. But having\nsmoothed out her gloves, and done what she could to look as usual, she\nforgot spectators, and was once more given up to her desperate desire\nto find Ralph Denham. It was a desire now wild, irrational,\nunexplained, resembling something felt in childhood. Once more she\nblamed herself bitterly for her carelessness. But finding herself\nopposite the Tube station, she pulled herself up and took counsel\nswiftly, as of old. It flashed upon her that she would go at once to\nMary Datchet, and ask her to give her Ralph s address. The decision was\na relief, not only in giving her a goal, but in providing her with a\nrational excuse for her own actions. It gave her a goal certainly, but\nthe fact of having a goal led her to dwell exclusively upon her\nobsession; so that when she rang the bell of Mary s flat, she did not\nfor a moment consider how this demand would strike Mary. To her extreme\nannoyance Mary was not at home; a charwoman opened the door. All\nKatharine could do was to accept the invitation to wait. She waited\nfor, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and spent them in pacing from one end of\nthe room to the other without intermission. When she heard Mary s key\nin the door she paused in front of the fireplace, and Mary found her\nstanding upright, looking at once expectant and determined, like a\nperson who has come on an errand of such importance that it must be\nbroached without preface.\n\nMary exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Katharine said, brushing these remarks aside, as if they\nwere in the way.\n\n\"Have you had tea?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years\nago, somewhere or other.\n\nMary paused, took off her gloves, and, finding matches, proceeded to\nlight the fire.\n\nKatharine checked her with an impatient movement, and said:\n\n\"Don t light the fire for me.... I want to know Ralph Denham s\naddress.\"\n\nShe was holding a pencil and preparing to write on the envelope. She\nwaited with an imperious expression.\n\n\"The Apple Orchard, Mount Ararat Road, Highgate,\" Mary said, speaking\nslowly and rather strangely.\n\n\"Oh, I remember now!\" Katharine exclaimed, with irritation at her own\nstupidity. \"I suppose it wouldn t take twenty minutes to drive there?\"\nShe gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go.\n\n\"But you won t find him,\" said Mary, pausing with a match in her hand.\nKatharine, who had already turned towards the door, stopped and looked\nat her.\n\n\"Why? Where is he?\" she asked.\n\n\"He won t have left his office.\"\n\n\"But he has left the office,\" she replied. \"The only question is will\nhe have reached home yet? He went to see me at Chelsea; I tried to meet\nhim and missed him. He will have found no message to explain. So I must\nfind him as soon as possible.\"\n\nMary took in the situation at her leisure.\n\n\"But why not telephone?\" she said.\n\nKatharine immediately dropped all that she was holding; her strained\nexpression relaxed, and exclaiming, \"Of course! Why didn t I think of\nthat!\" she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number. Mary\nlooked at her steadily, and then left the room. At length Katharine\nheard, through all the superimposed weight of London, the mysterious\nsound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room, where she\ncould almost see the pictures and the books; she listened with extreme\nintentness to the preparatory vibrations, and then established her\nidentity.\n\n\"Has Mr. Denham called?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss.\"\n\n\"Did he ask for me?\"\n\n\"Yes. We said you were out, miss.\"\n\n\"Did he leave any message?\"\n\n\"No. He went away. About twenty minutes ago, miss.\"\n\nKatharine hung up the receiver. She walked the length of the room in\nsuch acute disappointment that she did not at first perceive Mary s\nabsence. Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone:\n\n\"Mary.\"\n\nMary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom. She heard\nKatharine call her. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I shan t be a moment.\" But the\nmoment prolonged itself, as if for some reason Mary found satisfaction\nin making herself not only tidy, but seemly and ornamented. A stage in\nher life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces\nfor ever upon her bearing. Youth, and the bloom of youth, had receded,\nleaving the purpose of her face to show itself in the hollower cheeks,\nthe firmer lips, the eyes no longer spontaneously observing at random,\nbut narrowed upon an end which was not near at hand. This woman was now\na serviceable human being, mistress of her own destiny, and thus, by\nsome combination of ideas, fit to be adorned with the dignity of silver\nchains and glowing brooches. She came in at her leisure and asked:\n\"Well, did you get an answer?\"\n\n\"He has left Chelsea already,\" Katharine replied.\n\n\"Still, he won t be home yet,\" said Mary.\n\nKatharine was once more irresistibly drawn to gaze upon an imaginary\nmap of London, to follow the twists and turns of unnamed streets.\n\n\"I ll ring up his home and ask whether he s back.\" Mary crossed to the\ntelephone and, after a series of brief remarks, announced:\n\n\"No. His sister says he hasn t come back yet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" She applied her ear to the telephone once more. \"They ve had a\nmessage. He won t be back to dinner.\"\n\n\"Then what is he going to do?\"\n\nVery pale, and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon Mary as upon\nvistas of unresponding blankness, Katharine addressed herself also not\nso much to Mary as to the unrelenting spirit which now appeared to mock\nher from every quarter of her survey.\n\nAfter waiting a little time Mary remarked indifferently:\n\n\"I really don t know.\" Slackly lying back in her armchair, she watched\nthe little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently, as\nif they, too, were very distant and indifferent.\n\nKatharine looked at her indignantly and rose.\n\n\"Possibly he may come here,\" Mary continued, without altering the\nabstract tone of her voice. \"It would be worth your while to wait if\nyou want to see him to-night.\" She bent forward and touched the wood,\nso that the flames slipped in between the interstices of the coal.\n\nKatharine reflected. \"I ll wait half an hour,\" she said.\n\nMary rose, went to the table, spread out her papers under the\ngreen-shaded lamp and, with an action that was becoming a habit,\ntwisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers. Once she looked\nunperceived at her visitor, who never moved, who sat so still, with\neyes so intent, that you could almost fancy that she was watching\nsomething, some face that never looked up at her. Mary found herself\nunable to go on writing. She turned her eyes away, but only to be aware\nof the presence of what Katharine looked at. There were ghosts in the\nroom, and one, strangely and sadly, was the ghost of herself. The\nminutes went by.\n\n\"What would be the time now?\" said Katharine at last. The half-hour was\nnot quite spent.\n\n\"I m going to get dinner ready,\" said Mary, rising from her table.\n\n\"Then I ll go,\" said Katharine.\n\n\"Why don t you stay? Where are you going?\"\n\nKatharine looked round the room, conveying her uncertainty in her\nglance.\n\n\"Perhaps I might find him,\" she mused.\n\n\"But why should it matter? You ll see him another day.\"\n\nMary spoke, and intended to speak, cruelly enough.\n\n\"I was wrong to come here,\" Katharine replied.\n\nTheir eyes met with antagonism, and neither flinched.\n\n\"You had a perfect right to come here,\" Mary answered.\n\nA loud knocking at the door interrupted them. Mary went to open it, and\nreturning with some note or parcel, Katharine looked away so that Mary\nmight not read her disappointment.\n\n\"Of course you had a right to come,\" Mary repeated, laying the note\nupon the table.\n\n\"No,\" said Katharine. \"Except that when one s desperate one has a sort\nof right. I am desperate. How do I know what s happening to him now? He\nmay do anything. He may wander about the streets all night. Anything\nmay happen to him.\"\n\nShe spoke with a self-abandonment that Mary had never seen in her.\n\n\"You know you exaggerate; you re talking nonsense,\" she said roughly.\n\n\"Mary, I must talk I must tell you \"\n\n\"You needn t tell me anything,\" Mary interrupted her. \"Can t I see for\nmyself?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Katharine exclaimed. \"It s not that \"\n\nHer look, passing beyond Mary, beyond the verge of the room and out\nbeyond any words that came her way, wildly and passionately, convinced\nMary that she, at any rate, could not follow such a glance to its end.\nShe was baffled; she tried to think herself back again into the height\nof her love for Ralph. Pressing her fingers upon her eyelids, she\nmurmured:\n\n\"You forget that I loved him too. I thought I knew him. I _did_ know\nhim.\"\n\nAnd yet, what had she known? She could not remember it any more. She\npressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her\ndarkness. She convinced herself that she was stirring among ashes. She\ndesisted. She was astonished at her discovery. She did not love Ralph\nany more. She looked back dazed into the room, and her eyes rested upon\nthe table with its lamp-lit papers. The steady radiance seemed for a\nsecond to have its counterpart within her; she shut her eyes; she\nopened them and looked at the lamp again; another love burnt in the\nplace of the old one, or so, in a momentary glance of amazement, she\nguessed before the revelation was over and the old surroundings\nasserted themselves. She leant in silence against the mantelpiece.\n\n\"There are different ways of loving,\" she murmured, half to herself, at\nlength.\n\nKatharine made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. She seemed\nabsorbed in her own thoughts.\n\n\"Perhaps he s waiting in the street again to-night,\" she exclaimed.\n\"I ll go now. I might find him.\"\n\n\"It s far more likely that he ll come here,\" said Mary, and Katharine,\nafter considering for a moment, said:\n\n\"I ll wait another half-hour.\"\n\nShe sank down into her chair again, and took up the same position which\nMary had compared to the position of one watching an unseeing face. She\nwatched, indeed, not a face, but a procession, not of people, but of\nlife itself: the good and bad; the meaning; the past, the present, and\nthe future. All this seemed apparent to her, and she was not ashamed of\nher extravagance so much as exalted to one of the pinnacles of\nexistence, where it behoved the world to do her homage. No one but she\nherself knew what it meant to miss Ralph Denham on that particular\nnight; into this inadequate event crowded feelings that the great\ncrises of life might have failed to call forth. She had missed him, and\nknew the bitterness of all failure; she desired him, and knew the\ntorment of all passion. It did not matter what trivial accidents led to\nthis culmination. Nor did she care how extravagant she appeared, nor\nhow openly she showed her feelings.\n\nWhen the dinner was ready Mary told her to come, and she came\nsubmissively, as if she let Mary direct her movements for her. They ate\nand drank together almost in silence, and when Mary told her to eat\nmore, she ate more; when she was told to drink wine, she drank it.\nNevertheless, beneath this superficial obedience, Mary knew that she\nwas following her own thoughts unhindered. She was not inattentive so\nmuch as remote; she looked at once so unseeing and so intent upon some\nvision of her own that Mary gradually felt more than protective she\nbecame actually alarmed at the prospect of some collision between\nKatharine and the forces of the outside world. Directly they had done,\nKatharine announced her intention of going.\n\n\"But where are you going to?\" Mary asked, desiring vaguely to hinder\nher.\n\n\"Oh, I m going home no, to Highgate perhaps.\"\n\nMary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her. All she could do\nwas to insist upon coming too, but she met with no opposition;\nKatharine seemed indifferent to her presence. In a few minutes they\nwere walking along the Strand. They walked so rapidly that Mary was\ndeluded into the belief that Katharine knew where she was going. She\nherself was not attentive. She was glad of the movement along lamp-lit\nstreets in the open air. She was fingering, painfully and with fear,\nyet with strange hope, too, the discovery which she had stumbled upon\nunexpectedly that night. She was free once more at the cost of a gift,\nthe best, perhaps, that she could offer, but she was, thank Heaven, in\nlove no longer. She was tempted to spend the first instalment of her\nfreedom in some dissipation; in the pit of the Coliseum, for example,\nsince they were now passing the door. Why not go in and celebrate her\nindependence of the tyranny of love? Or, perhaps, the top of an omnibus\nbound for some remote place such as Camberwell, or Sidcup, or the Welsh\nHarp would suit her better. She noticed these names painted on little\nboards for the first time for weeks. Or should she return to her room,\nand spend the night working out the details of a very enlightened and\ningenious scheme? Of all possibilities this appealed to her most, and\nbrought to mind the fire, the lamplight, the steady glow which had\nseemed lit in the place where a more passionate flame had once burnt.\n\nNow Katharine stopped, and Mary woke to the fact that instead of having\na goal she had evidently none. She paused at the edge of the crossing,\nand looked this way and that, and finally made as if in the direction\nof Haverstock Hill.\n\n\"Look here where are you going?\" Mary cried, catching her by the hand.\n\"We must take that cab and go home.\" She hailed a cab and insisted that\nKatharine should get in, while she directed the driver to take them to\nCheyne Walk.\n\nKatharine submitted. \"Very well,\" she said. \"We may as well go there as\nanywhere else.\"\n\nA gloom seemed to have fallen on her. She lay back in her corner,\nsilent and apparently exhausted. Mary, in spite of her own\npreoccupation, was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection.\n\n\"I m sure we shall find him,\" she said more gently than she had yet\nspoken.\n\n\"It may be too late,\" Katharine replied. Without understanding her,\nMary began to pity her for what she was suffering.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she said, taking her hand and rubbing it. \"If we don t find\nhim there we shall find him somewhere else.\"\n\n\"But suppose he s walking about the streets for hours and hours?\"\n\nShe leant forward and looked out of the window.\n\n\"He may refuse ever to speak to me again,\" she said in a low voice,\nalmost to herself.\n\nThe exaggeration was so immense that Mary did not attempt to cope with\nit, save by keeping hold of Katharine s wrist. She half expected that\nKatharine might open the door suddenly and jump out. Perhaps Katharine\nperceived the purpose with which her hand was held.\n\n\"Don t be frightened,\" she said, with a little laugh. \"I m not going to\njump out of the cab. It wouldn t do much good after all.\"\n\nUpon this, Mary ostentatiously withdrew her hand.\n\n\"I ought to have apologized,\" Katharine continued, with an effort, \"for\nbringing you into all this business; I haven t told you half, either.\nI m no longer engaged to William Rodney. He is to marry Cassandra\nOtway. It s all arranged all perfectly right.... And after he d waited\nin the streets for hours and hours, William made me bring him in. He\nwas standing under the lamp-post watching our windows. He was perfectly\nwhite when he came into the room. William left us alone, and we sat and\ntalked. It seems ages and ages ago, now. Was it last night? Have I been\nout long? What s the time?\" She sprang forward to catch sight of a\nclock, as if the exact time had some important bearing on her case.\n\n\"Only half-past eight!\" she exclaimed. \"Then he may be there still.\"\nShe leant out of the window and told the cabman to drive faster.\n\n\"But if he s not there, what shall I do? Where could I find him? The\nstreets are so crowded.\"\n\n\"We shall find him,\" Mary repeated.\n\nMary had no doubt but that somehow or other they would find him. But\nsuppose they did find him? She began to think of Ralph with a sort of\nstrangeness, in her effort to understand how he could be capable of\nsatisfying this extraordinary desire. Once more she thought herself\nback to her old view of him and could, with an effort, recall the haze\nwhich surrounded his figure, and the sense of confused, heightened\nexhilaration which lay all about his neighborhood, so that for months\nat a time she had never exactly heard his voice or seen his face or so\nit now seemed to her. The pain of her loss shot through her. Nothing\nwould ever make up not success, or happiness, or oblivion. But this\npang was immediately followed by the assurance that now, at any rate,\nshe knew the truth; and Katharine, she thought, stealing a look at her,\ndid not know the truth; yes, Katharine was immensely to be pitied.\n\nThe cab, which had been caught in the traffic, was now liberated and\nsped on down Sloane Street. Mary was conscious of the tension with\nwhich Katharine marked its progress, as if her mind were fixed upon a\npoint in front of them, and marked, second by second, their approach to\nit. She said nothing, and in silence Mary began to fix her mind, in\nsympathy at first, and later in forgetfulness of her companion, upon a\npoint in front of them. She imagined a point distant as a low star upon\nthe horizon of the dark. There for her too, for them both, was the goal\nfor which they were striving, and the end for the ardors of their\nspirits was the same: but where it was, or what it was, or why she felt\nconvinced that they were united in search of it, as they drove swiftly\ndown the streets of London side by side, she could not have said.\n\n\"At last,\" Katharine breathed, as the cab drew up at the door. She\njumped out and scanned the pavement on either side. Mary, meanwhile,\nrang the bell. The door opened as Katharine assured herself that no one\nof the people within view had any likeness to Ralph. On seeing her, the\nmaid said at once:\n\n\"Mr. Denham called again, miss. He has been waiting for you for some\ntime.\"\n\nKatharine vanished from Mary s sight. The door shut between them, and\nMary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone.\n\nKatharine turned at once to the dining-room. But with her fingers upon\nthe handle, she held back. Perhaps she realized that this was a moment\nwhich would never come again. Perhaps, for a second, it seemed to her\nthat no reality could equal the imagination she had formed. Perhaps she\nwas restrained by some vague fear or anticipation, which made her dread\nany exchange or interruption. But if these doubts and fears or this\nsupreme bliss restrained her, it was only for a moment. In another\nsecond she had turned the handle and, biting her lip to control\nherself, she opened the door upon Ralph Denham. An extraordinary\nclearness of sight seemed to possess her on beholding him. So little,\nso single, so separate from all else he appeared, who had been the\ncause of these extreme agitations and aspirations. She could have\nlaughed in his face. But, gaining upon this clearness of sight against\nher will, and to her dislike, was a flood of confusion, of relief, of\ncertainty, of humility, of desire no longer to strive and to\ndiscriminate, yielding to which, she let herself sink within his arms\nand confessed her love.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXII\n\n\nNobody asked Katharine any questions next day. If cross-examined she\nmight have said that nobody spoke to her. She worked a little, wrote a\nlittle, ordered the dinner, and sat, for longer than she knew, with her\nhead on her hand piercing whatever lay before her, whether it was a\nletter or a dictionary, as if it were a film upon the deep prospects\nthat revealed themselves to her kindling and brooding eyes. She rose\nonce, and going to the bookcase, took out her father s Greek dictionary\nand spread the sacred pages of symbols and figures before her. She\nsmoothed the sheets with a mixture of affectionate amusement and hope.\nWould other eyes look on them with her one day? The thought, long\nintolerable, was now just bearable.\n\nShe was quite unaware of the anxiety with which her movements were\nwatched and her expression scanned. Cassandra was careful not to be\ncaught looking at her, and their conversation was so prosaic that were\nit not for certain jolts and jerks between the sentences, as if the\nmind were kept with difficulty to the rails, Mrs. Milvain herself could\nhave detected nothing of a suspicious nature in what she overheard.\n\nWilliam, when he came in late that afternoon and found Cassandra alone,\nhad a very serious piece of news to impart. He had just passed\nKatharine in the street and she had failed to recognize him.\n\n\"That doesn t matter with me, of course, but suppose it happened with\nsomebody else? What would they think? They would suspect something\nmerely from her expression. She looked she looked\" he hesitated \"like\nsome one walking in her sleep.\"\n\nTo Cassandra the significant thing was that Katharine had gone out\nwithout telling her, and she interpreted this to mean that she had gone\nout to meet Ralph Denham. But to her surprise William drew no comfort\nfrom this probability.\n\n\"Once throw conventions aside,\" he began, \"once do the things that\npeople don t do \" and the fact that you are going to meet a young man\nis no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that people will talk.\n\nCassandra saw, not without a pang of jealousy, that he was extremely\nsolicitous that people should not talk about Katharine, as if his\ninterest in her were still proprietary rather than friendly. As they\nwere both ignorant of Ralph s visit the night before they had not that\nreason to comfort themselves with the thought that matters were\nhastening to a crisis. These absences of Katharine s, moreover, left\nthem exposed to interruptions which almost destroyed their pleasure in\nbeing alone together. The rainy evening made it impossible to go out;\nand, indeed, according to William s code, it was considerably more\ndamning to be seen out of doors than surprised within. They were so\nmuch at the mercy of bells and doors that they could hardly talk of\nMacaulay with any conviction, and William preferred to defer the second\nact of his tragedy until another day.\n\nUnder these circumstances Cassandra showed herself at her best. She\nsympathized with William s anxieties and did her utmost to share them;\nbut still, to be alone together, to be running risks together, to be\npartners in the wonderful conspiracy, was to her so enthralling that\nshe was always forgetting discretion, breaking out into exclamations\nand admirations which finally made William believe that, although\ndeplorable and upsetting, the situation was not without its sweetness.\n\nWhen the door did open, he started, but braved the forthcoming\nrevelation. It was not Mrs. Milvain, however, but Katharine herself who\nentered, closely followed by Ralph Denham. With a set expression which\nshowed what an effort she was making, Katharine encountered their eyes,\nand saying, \"We re not going to interrupt you,\" she led Denham behind\nthe curtain which hung in front of the room with the relics. This\nrefuge was none of her willing, but confronted with wet pavements and\nonly some belated museum or Tube station for shelter, she was forced,\nfor Ralph s sake, to face the discomforts of her own house. Under the\nstreet lamps she had thought him looking both tired and strained.\n\nThus separated, the two couples remained occupied for some time with\ntheir own affairs. Only the lowest murmurs penetrated from one section\nof the room to the other. At length the maid came in to bring a message\nthat Mr. Hilbery would not be home for dinner. It was true that there\nwas no need that Katharine should be informed, but William began to\ninquire Cassandra s opinion in such a way as to show that, with or\nwithout reason, he wished very much to speak to her.\n\nFrom motives of her own Cassandra dissuaded him.\n\n\"But don t you think it s a little unsociable?\" he hazarded. \"Why not\ndo something amusing? go to the play, for instance? Why not ask\nKatharine and Ralph, eh?\" The coupling of their names in this manner\ncaused Cassandra s heart to leap with pleasure.\n\n\"Don t you think they must be ?\" she began, but William hastily took\nher up.\n\n\"Oh, I know nothing about that. I only thought we might amuse\nourselves, as your uncle s out.\"\n\nHe proceeded on his embassy with a mixture of excitement and\nembarrassment which caused him to turn aside with his hand on the\ncurtain, and to examine intently for several moments the portrait of a\nlady, optimistically said by Mrs. Hilbery to be an early work of Sir\nJoshua Reynolds. Then, with some unnecessary fumbling, he drew aside\nthe curtain, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground, repeated his\nmessage and suggested that they should all spend the evening at the\nplay. Katharine accepted the suggestion with such cordiality that it\nwas strange to find her of no clear mind as to the precise spectacle\nshe wished to see. She left the choice entirely to Ralph and William,\nwho, taking counsel fraternally over an evening paper, found themselves\nin agreement as to the merits of a music-hall. This being arranged,\neverything else followed easily and enthusiastically. Cassandra had\nnever been to a music-hall. Katharine instructed her in the peculiar\ndelights of an entertainment where Polar bears follow directly upon\nladies in full evening dress, and the stage is alternately a garden of\nmystery, a milliner s band-box, and a fried-fish shop in the Mile End\nRoad. Whatever the exact nature of the program that night, it fulfilled\nthe highest purposes of dramatic art, so far, at least, as four of the\naudience were concerned.\n\nNo doubt the actors and the authors would have been surprised to learn\nin what shape their efforts reached those particular eyes and ears; but\nthey could not have denied that the effect as a whole was tremendous.\nThe hall resounded with brass and strings, alternately of enormous pomp\nand majesty, and then of sweetest lamentation. The reds and creams of\nthe background, the lyres and harps and urns and skulls, the\nprotuberances of plaster, the fringes of scarlet plush, the sinking and\nblazing of innumerable electric lights, could scarcely have been\nsurpassed for decorative effect by any craftsman of the ancient or\nmodern world.\n\nThen there was the audience itself, bare-shouldered, tufted and\ngarlanded in the stalls, decorous but festal in the balconies, and\nfrankly fit for daylight and street life in the galleries. But, however\nthey differed when looked at separately, they shared the same huge,\nlovable nature in the bulk, which murmured and swayed and quivered all\nthe time the dancing and juggling and love-making went on in front of\nit, slowly laughed and reluctantly left off laughing, and applauded\nwith a helter-skelter generosity which sometimes became unanimous and\noverwhelming. Once William saw Katharine leaning forward and clapping\nher hands with an abandonment that startled him. Her laugh rang out\nwith the laughter of the audience.\n\nFor a second he was puzzled, as if this laughter disclosed something\nthat he had never suspected in her. But then Cassandra s face caught\nhis eye, gazing with astonishment at the buffoon, not laughing, too\ndeeply intent and surprised to laugh at what she saw, and for some\nmoments he watched her as if she were a child.\n\nThe performance came to an end, the illusion dying out first here and\nthen there, as some rose to put on their coats, others stood upright to\nsalute \"God Save the King,\" the musicians folded their music and\nencased their instruments, and the lights sank one by one until the\nhouse was empty, silent, and full of great shadows. Looking back over\nher shoulder as she followed Ralph through the swing doors, Cassandra\nmarveled to see how the stage was already entirely without romance.\nBut, she wondered, did they really cover all the seats in brown holland\nevery night?\n\nThe success of this entertainment was such that before they separated\nanother expedition had been planned for the next day. The next day was\nSaturday; therefore both William and Ralph were free to devote the\nwhole afternoon to an expedition to Greenwich, which Cassandra had\nnever seen, and Katharine confused with Dulwich. On this occasion Ralph\nwas their guide. He brought them without accident to Greenwich.\n\nWhat exigencies of state or fantasies of imagination first gave birth\nto the cluster of pleasant places by which London is surrounded is\nmatter of indifference now that they have adapted themselves so\nadmirably to the needs of people between the ages of twenty and thirty\nwith Saturday afternoons to spend. Indeed, if ghosts have any interest\nin the affections of those who succeed them they must reap their\nrichest harvests when the fine weather comes again and the lovers, the\nsightseers, and the holiday-makers pour themselves out of trains and\nomnibuses into their old pleasure-grounds. It is true that they go, for\nthe most part, unthanked by name, although upon this occasion William\nwas ready to give such discriminating praise as the dead architects and\npainters received seldom in the course of the year. They were walking\nby the river bank, and Katharine and Ralph, lagging a little behind,\ncaught fragments of his lecture. Katharine smiled at the sound of his\nvoice; she listened as if she found it a little unfamiliar, intimately\nthough she knew it; she tested it. The note of assurance and happiness\nwas new. William was very happy. She learnt every hour what sources of\nhis happiness she had neglected. She had never asked him to teach her\nanything; she had never consented to read Macaulay; she had never\nexpressed her belief that his play was second only to the works of\nShakespeare. She followed dreamily in their wake, smiling and\ndelighting in the sound which conveyed, she knew, the rapturous and yet\nnot servile assent of Cassandra.\n\nThen she murmured, \"How can Cassandra \" but changed her sentence to the\nopposite of what she meant to say and ended, \"how could she herself\nhave been so blind?\" But it was unnecessary to follow out such riddles\nwhen the presence of Ralph supplied her with more interesting problems,\nwhich somehow became involved with the little boat crossing the river,\nthe majestic and careworn City, and the steamers homecoming with their\ntreasury, or starting in search of it, so that infinite leisure would\nbe necessary for the proper disentanglement of one from the other. He\nstopped, moreover, and began inquiring of an old boatman as to the\ntides and the ships. In thus talking he seemed different, and even\nlooked different, she thought, against the river, with the steeples and\ntowers for background. His strangeness, his romance, his power to leave\nher side and take part in the affairs of men, the possibility that they\nshould together hire a boat and cross the river, the speed and wildness\nof this enterprise filled her mind and inspired her with such rapture,\nhalf of love and half of adventure, that William and Cassandra were\nstartled from their talk, and Cassandra exclaimed, \"She looks as if she\nwere offering up a sacrifice! Very beautiful,\" she added quickly,\nthough she repressed, in deference to William, her own wonder that the\nsight of Ralph Denham talking to a boatman on the banks of the Thames\ncould move any one to such an attitude of adoration.\n\nThat afternoon, what with tea and the curiosities of the Thames tunnel\nand the unfamiliarity of the streets, passed so quickly that the only\nmethod of prolonging it was to plan another expedition for the\nfollowing day. Hampton Court was decided upon, in preference to\nHampstead, for though Cassandra had dreamt as a child of the brigands\nof Hampstead, she had now transferred her affections completely and for\never to William III. Accordingly, they arrived at Hampton Court about\nlunch-time on a fine Sunday morning. Such unity marked their\nexpressions of admiration for the red-brick building that they might\nhave come there for no other purpose than to assure each other that\nthis palace was the stateliest palace in the world. They walked up and\ndown the Terrace, four abreast, and fancied themselves the owners of\nthe place, and calculated the amount of good to the world produced\nindubitably by such a tenancy.\n\n\"The only hope for us,\" said Katharine, \"is that William shall die, and\nCassandra shall be given rooms as the widow of a distinguished poet.\"\n\n\"Or \" Cassandra began, but checked herself from the liberty of\nenvisaging Katharine as the widow of a distinguished lawyer. Upon this,\nthe third day of junketing, it was tiresome to have to restrain oneself\neven from such innocent excursions of fancy. She dared not question\nWilliam; he was inscrutable; he never seemed even to follow the other\ncouple with curiosity when they separated, as they frequently did, to\nname a plant, or examine a fresco. Cassandra was constantly studying\ntheir backs. She noticed how sometimes the impulse to move came from\nKatharine, and sometimes from Ralph; how, sometimes, they walked slow,\nas if in profound intercourse, and sometimes fast, as if in passionate.\nWhen they came together again nothing could be more unconcerned than\ntheir manner.\n\n\"We have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish...\" or, \"We must\nleave time to visit the Maze.\" Then, to puzzle her further, William and\nRalph filled in all interstices of meal-times or railway journeys with\nperfectly good-tempered arguments; or they discussed politics, or they\ntold stories, or they did sums together upon the backs of old envelopes\nto prove something. She suspected that Katharine was absent-minded, but\nit was impossible to tell. There were moments when she felt so young\nand inexperienced that she almost wished herself back with the\nsilkworms at Stogdon House, and not embarked upon this bewildering\nintrigue.\n\nThese moments, however, were only the necessary shadow or chill which\nproved the substance of her bliss, and did not damage the radiance\nwhich seemed to rest equally upon the whole party. The fresh air of\nspring, the sky washed of clouds and already shedding warmth from its\nblue, seemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to the mood of her chosen\nspirits. These chosen spirits were to be found also among the deer,\ndumbly basking, and among the fish, set still in mid-stream, for they\nwere mute sharers in a benignant state not needing any exposition by\nthe tongue. No words that Cassandra could come by expressed the\nstillness, the brightness, the air of expectancy which lay upon the\norderly beauty of the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went\nwalking four abreast that Sunday afternoon. Silently the shadows of the\ntrees lay across the broad sunshine; silence wrapt her heart in its\nfolds. The quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half-opened\nflower, the silent grazing of the deer in the sun, were the sights her\neye rested upon and received as the images of her own nature laid open\nto happiness and trembling in its ecstasy.\n\nBut the afternoon wore on, and it became time to leave the gardens. As\nthey drove from Waterloo to Chelsea, Katharine began to have some\ncompunction about her father, which, together with the opening of\noffices and the need of working in them on Monday, made it difficult to\nplan another festival for the following day. Mr. Hilbery had taken\ntheir absence, so far, with paternal benevolence, but they could not\ntrespass upon it indefinitely. Indeed, had they known it, he was\nalready suffering from their absence, and longing for their return.\n\nHe had no dislike of solitude, and Sunday, in particular, was\npleasantly adapted for letter-writing, paying calls, or a visit to his\nclub. He was leaving the house on some such suitable expedition towards\ntea-time when he found himself stopped on his own doorstep by his\nsister, Mrs. Milvain. She should, on hearing that no one was at home,\nhave withdrawn submissively, but instead she accepted his half-hearted\ninvitation to come in, and he found himself in the melancholy position\nof being forced to order tea for her and sit in the drawing-room while\nshe drank it. She speedily made it plain that she was only thus\nexacting because she had come on a matter of business. He was by no\nmeans exhilarated at the news.\n\n\"Katharine is out this afternoon,\" he remarked. \"Why not come round\nlater and discuss it with her with us both, eh?\"\n\n\"My dear Trevor, I have particular reasons for wishing to talk to you\nalone.... Where is Katharine?\"\n\n\"She s out with her young man, naturally. Cassandra plays the part of\nchaperone very usefully. A charming young woman that a great favorite\nof mine.\" He turned his stone between his fingers, and conceived\ndifferent methods of leading Celia away from her obsession, which, he\nsupposed, must have reference to the domestic affairs of Cyril as\nusual.\n\n\"With Cassandra,\" Mrs. Milvain repeated significantly. \"With\nCassandra.\"\n\n\"Yes, with Cassandra,\" Mr. Hilbery agreed urbanely, pleased at the\ndiversion. \"I think they said they were going to Hampton Court, and I\nrather believe they were taking a protege of mine, Ralph Denham, a very\nclever fellow, too, to amuse Cassandra. I thought the arrangement very\nsuitable.\" He was prepared to dwell at some length upon this safe\ntopic, and trusted that Katharine would come in before he had done with\nit.\n\n\"Hampton Court always seems to me an ideal spot for engaged couples.\nThere s the Maze, there s a nice place for having tea I forget what\nthey call it and then, if the young man knows his business he contrives\nto take his lady upon the river. Full of possibilities full. Cake,\nCelia?\" Mr. Hilbery continued. \"I respect my dinner too much, but that\ncan t possibly apply to you. You ve never observed that feast, so far\nas I can remember.\"\n\nHer brother s affability did not deceive Mrs. Milvain; it slightly\nsaddened her; she well knew the cause of it. Blind and infatuated as\nusual!\n\n\"Who is this Mr. Denham?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ralph Denham?\" said Mr. Hilbery, in relief that her mind had taken\nthis turn. \"A very interesting young man. I ve a great belief in him.\nHe s an authority upon our mediaeval institutions, and if he weren t\nforced to earn his living he would write a book that very much wants\nwriting \"\n\n\"He is not well off, then?\" Mrs. Milvain interposed.\n\n\"Hasn t a penny, I m afraid, and a family more or less dependent on\nhim.\"\n\n\"A mother and sisters? His father is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, his father died some years ago,\" said Mr. Hilbery, who was\nprepared to draw upon his imagination, if necessary, to keep Mrs.\nMilvain supplied with facts about the private history of Ralph Denham\nsince, for some inscrutable reason, the subject took her fancy.\n\n\"His father has been dead some time, and this young man had to take his\nplace \"\n\n\"A legal family?\" Mrs. Milvain inquired. \"I fancy I ve seen the name\nsomewhere.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery shook his head. \"I should be inclined to doubt whether they\nwere altogether in that walk of life,\" he observed. \"I fancy that\nDenham once told me that his father was a corn merchant. Perhaps he\nsaid a stockbroker. He came to grief, anyhow, as stockbrokers have a\nway of doing. I ve a great respect for Denham,\" he added. The remark\nsounded to his ears unfortunately conclusive, and he was afraid that\nthere was nothing more to be said about Denham. He examined the tips of\nhis fingers carefully. \"Cassandra s grown into a very charming young\nwoman,\" he started afresh. \"Charming to look at, and charming to talk\nto, though her historical knowledge is not altogether profound. Another\ncup of tea?\"\n\nMrs. Milvain had given her cup a little push, which seemed to indicate\nsome momentary displeasure. But she did not want any more tea.\n\n\"It is Cassandra that I have come about,\" she began. \"I am very sorry\nto say that Cassandra is not at all what you think her, Trevor. She has\nimposed upon your and Maggie s goodness. She has behaved in a way that\nwould have seemed incredible in this house of all houses were it not\nfor other circumstances that are still more incredible.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery looked taken aback, and was silent for a second.\n\n\"It all sounds very black,\" he remarked urbanely, continuing his\nexamination of his finger-nails. \"But I own I am completely in the\ndark.\"\n\nMrs. Milvain became rigid, and emitted her message in little short\nsentences of extreme intensity.\n\n\"Who has Cassandra gone out with? William Rodney. Who has Katharine\ngone out with? Ralph Denham. Why are they for ever meeting each other\nround street corners, and going to music-halls, and taking cabs late at\nnight? Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when I question her? I\nunderstand the reason now. Katharine has entangled herself with this\nunknown lawyer; she has seen fit to condone Cassandra s conduct.\"\n\nThere was another slight pause.\n\n\"Ah, well, Katharine will no doubt have some explanation to give me,\"\nMr. Hilbery replied imperturbably. \"It s a little too complicated for\nme to take in all at once, I confess and, if you won t think me rude,\nCelia, I think I ll be getting along towards Knightsbridge.\"\n\nMrs. Milvain rose at once.\n\n\"She has condoned Cassandra s conduct and entangled herself with Ralph\nDenham,\" she repeated. She stood very erect with the dauntless air of\none testifying to the truth regardless of consequences. She knew from\npast discussions that the only way to counter her brother s indolence\nand indifference was to shoot her statements at him in a compressed\nform once finally upon leaving the room. Having spoken thus, she\nrestrained herself from adding another word, and left the house with\nthe dignity of one inspired by a great ideal.\n\nShe had certainly framed her remarks in such a way as to prevent her\nbrother from paying his call in the region of Knightsbridge. He had no\nfears for Katharine, but there was a suspicion at the back of his mind\nthat Cassandra might have been, innocently and ignorantly, led into\nsome foolish situation in one of their unshepherded dissipations. His\nwife was an erratic judge of the conventions; he himself was lazy; and\nwith Katharine absorbed, very naturally Here he recalled, as well as he\ncould, the exact nature of the charge. \"She has condoned Cassandra s\nconduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham.\" From which it\nappeared that Katharine was _not_ absorbed, or which of them was it\nthat had entangled herself with Ralph Denham? From this maze of\nabsurdity Mr. Hilbery saw no way out until Katharine herself came to\nhis help, so that he applied himself, very philosophically on the\nwhole, to a book.\n\nNo sooner had he heard the young people come in and go upstairs than he\nsent a maid to tell Miss Katharine that he wished to speak to her in\nthe study. She was slipping furs loosely onto the floor in the\ndrawing-room in front of the fire. They were all gathered round,\nreluctant to part. The message from her father surprised Katharine, and\nthe others caught from her look, as she turned to go, a vague sense of\napprehension.\n\nMr. Hilbery was reassured by the sight of her. He congratulated\nhimself, he prided himself, upon possessing a daughter who had a sense\nof responsibility and an understanding of life profound beyond her\nyears. Moreover, she was looking to-day unusual; he had come to take\nher beauty for granted; now he remembered it and was surprised by it.\nHe thought instinctively that he had interrupted some happy hour of\nhers with Rodney, and apologized.\n\n\"I m sorry to bother you, my dear. I heard you come in, and thought I d\nbetter make myself disagreeable at once as it seems, unfortunately,\nthat fathers are expected to make themselves disagreeable. Now, your\nAunt Celia has been to see me; your Aunt Celia has taken it into her\nhead apparently that you and Cassandra have been let us say a little\nfoolish. This going about together these pleasant little\nparties there s been some kind of misunderstanding. I told her I saw no\nharm in it, but I should just like to hear from yourself. Has Cassandra\nbeen left a little too much in the company of Mr. Denham?\"\n\nKatharine did not reply at once, and Mr. Hilbery tapped the coal\nencouragingly with the poker. Then she said, without embarrassment or\napology:\n\n\"I don t see why I should answer Aunt Celia s questions. I ve told her\nalready that I won t.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery was relieved and secretly amused at the thought of the\ninterview, although he could not license such irreverence outwardly.\n\n\"Very good. Then you authorize me to tell her that she s been mistaken,\nand there was nothing but a little fun in it? You ve no doubt,\nKatharine, in your own mind? Cassandra is in our charge, and I don t\nintend that people should gossip about her. I suggest that you should\nbe a little more careful in future. Invite me to your next\nentertainment.\"\n\nShe did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or humorous\nreply. She meditated, pondering something or other, and he reflected\nthat even his Katharine did not differ from other women in the capacity\nto let things be. Or had she something to say?\n\n\"Have you a guilty conscience?\" he inquired lightly. \"Tell me,\nKatharine,\" he said more seriously, struck by something in the\nexpression of her eyes.\n\n\"I ve been meaning to tell you for some time,\" she said, \"I m not going\nto marry William.\"\n\n\"You re not going !\" he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his immense\nsurprise. \"Why? When? Explain yourself, Katharine.\"\n\n\"Oh, some time ago a week, perhaps more.\" Katharine spoke hurriedly and\nindifferently, as if the matter could no longer concern any one.\n\n\"But may I ask why have I not been told of this what do you mean by\nit?\"\n\n\"We don t wish to be married that s all.\"\n\n\"This is William s wish as well as yours?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. We agree perfectly.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery had seldom felt more completely at a loss. He thought that\nKatharine was treating the matter with curious unconcern; she scarcely\nseemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying; he did not\nunderstand the position at all. But his desire to smooth everything\nover comfortably came to his relief. No doubt there was some quarrel,\nsome whimsey on the part of William, who, though a good fellow, was a\nlittle exacting sometimes something that a woman could put right. But\nthough he inclined to take the easiest view of his responsibilities, he\ncared too much for this daughter to let things be.\n\n\"I confess I find great difficulty in following you. I should like to\nhear William s side of the story,\" he said irritably. \"I think he ought\nto have spoken to me in the first instance.\"\n\n\"I wouldn t let him,\" said Katharine. \"I know it must seem to you very\nstrange,\" she added. \"But I assure you, if you d wait a little until\nmother comes back.\"\n\nThis appeal for delay was much to Mr. Hilbery s liking. But his\nconscience would not suffer it. People were talking. He could not\nendure that his daughter s conduct should be in any way considered\nirregular. He wondered whether, in the circumstances, it would be\nbetter to wire to his wife, to send for one of his sisters, to forbid\nWilliam the house, to pack Cassandra off home for he was vaguely\nconscious of responsibilities in her direction, too. His forehead was\nbecoming more and more wrinkled by the multiplicity of his anxieties,\nwhich he was sorely tempted to ask Katharine to solve for him, when the\ndoor opened and William Rodney appeared. This necessitated a complete\nchange, not only of manner, but of position also.\n\n\"Here s William,\" Katharine exclaimed, in a tone of relief. \"I ve told\nfather we re not engaged,\" she said to him. \"I ve explained that I\nprevented you from telling him.\"\n\nWilliam s manner was marked by the utmost formality. He bowed very\nslightly in the direction of Mr. Hilbery, and stood erect, holding one\nlapel of his coat, and gazing into the center of the fire. He waited\nfor Mr. Hilbery to speak.\n\nMr. Hilbery also assumed an appearance of formidable dignity. He had\nrisen to his feet, and now bent the top part of his body slightly\nforward.\n\n\"I should like your account of this affair, Rodney if Katharine no\nlonger prevents you from speaking.\"\n\nWilliam waited two seconds at least.\n\n\"Our engagement is at an end,\" he said, with the utmost stiffness.\n\n\"Has this been arrived at by your joint desire?\"\n\nAfter a perceptible pause William bent his head, and Katharine said, as\nif by an afterthought:\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery swayed to and fro, and moved his lips as if to utter\nremarks which remained unspoken.\n\n\"I can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until the\neffect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off. You have now\nknown each other \" he began.\n\n\"There s been no misunderstanding,\" Katharine interposed. \"Nothing at\nall.\" She moved a few paces across the room, as if she intended to\nleave them. Her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast to her\nfather s pomposity and to William s military rigidity. He had not once\nraised his eyes. Katharine s glance, on the other hand, ranged past the\ntwo gentlemen, along the books, over the tables, towards the door. She\nwas paying the least possible attention, it seemed, to what was\nhappening. Her father looked at her with a sudden clouding and\ntroubling of his expression. Somehow his faith in her stability and\nsense was queerly shaken. He no longer felt that he could ultimately\nentrust her with the whole conduct of her own affairs after a\nsuperficial show of directing them. He felt, for the first time in many\nyears, responsible for her.\n\n\"Look here, we must get to the bottom of this,\" he said, dropping his\nformal manner and addressing Rodney as if Katharine were not present.\n\"You ve had some difference of opinion, eh? Take my word for it, most\npeople go through this sort of thing when they re engaged. I ve seen\nmore trouble come from long engagements than from any other form of\nhuman folly. Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your\nminds both of you. I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion.\nVisit some cheerful seaside resort, Rodney.\"\n\nHe was struck by William s appearance, which seemed to him to indicate\nprofound feeling resolutely held in check. No doubt, he reflected,\nKatharine had been very trying, unconsciously trying, and had driven\nhim to take up a position which was none of his willing. Mr. Hilbery\ncertainly did not overrate William s sufferings. No minutes in his life\nhad hitherto extorted from him such intensity of anguish. He was now\nfacing the consequences of his insanity. He must confess himself\nentirely and fundamentally other than Mr. Hilbery thought him.\nEverything was against him. Even the Sunday evening and the fire and\nthe tranquil library scene were against him. Mr. Hilbery s appeal to\nhim as a man of the world was terribly against him. He was no longer a\nman of any world that Mr. Hilbery cared to recognize. But some power\ncompelled him, as it had compelled him to come downstairs, to make his\nstand here and now, alone and unhelped by any one, without prospect of\nreward. He fumbled with various phrases; and then jerked out:\n\n\"I love Cassandra.\"\n\nMr. Hilbery s face turned a curious dull purple. He looked at his\ndaughter. He nodded his head, as if to convey his silent command to her\nto leave the room; but either she did not notice it or preferred not to\nobey.\n\n\"You have the impudence \" Mr. Hilbery began, in a dull, low voice that\nhe himself had never heard before, when there was a scuffling and\nexclaiming in the hall, and Cassandra, who appeared to be insisting\nagainst some dissuasion on the part of another, burst into the room.\n\n\"Uncle Trevor,\" she exclaimed, \"I insist upon telling you the truth!\"\nShe flung herself between Rodney and her uncle, as if she sought to\nintercept their blows. As her uncle stood perfectly still, looking very\nlarge and imposing, and as nobody spoke, she shrank back a little, and\nlooked first at Katharine and then at Rodney. \"You must know the\ntruth,\" she said, a little lamely.\n\n\"You have the impudence to tell me this in Katharine s presence?\" Mr.\nHilbery continued, speaking with complete disregard of Cassandra s\ninterruption.\n\n\"I am aware, quite aware \" Rodney s words, which were broken in sense,\nspoken after a pause, and with his eyes upon the ground, nevertheless\nexpressed an astonishing amount of resolution. \"I am quite aware what\nyou must think of me,\" he brought out, looking Mr. Hilbery directly in\nthe eyes for the first time.\n\n\"I could express my views on the subject more fully if we were alone,\"\nMr. Hilbery returned.\n\n\"But you forget me,\" said Katharine. She moved a little towards Rodney,\nand her movement seemed to testify mutely to her respect for him, and\nher alliance with him. \"I think William has behaved perfectly rightly,\nand, after all, it is I who am concerned I and Cassandra.\"\n\nCassandra, too, gave an indescribably slight movement which seemed to\ndraw the three of them into alliance together. Katharine s tone and\nglance made Mr. Hilbery once more feel completely at a loss, and in\naddition, painfully and angrily obsolete; but in spite of an awful\ninner hollowness he was outwardly composed.\n\n\"Cassandra and Rodney have a perfect right to settle their own affairs\naccording to their own wishes; but I see no reason why they should do\nso either in my room or in my house.... I wish to be quite clear on\nthis point, however; you are no longer engaged to Rodney.\"\n\nHe paused, and his pause seemed to signify that he was extremely\nthankful for his daughter s deliverance.\n\nCassandra turned to Katharine, who drew her breath as if to speak and\nchecked herself; Rodney, too, seemed to await some movement on her\npart; her father glanced at her as if he half anticipated some further\nrevelation. She remained perfectly silent. In the silence they heard\ndistinctly steps descending the staircase, and Katharine went straight\nto the door.\n\n\"Wait,\" Mr. Hilbery commanded. \"I wish to speak to you alone,\" he\nadded.\n\nShe paused, holding the door ajar.\n\n\"I ll come back,\" she said, and as she spoke she opened the door and\nwent out. They could hear her immediately speak to some one outside,\nthough the words were inaudible.\n\nMr. Hilbery was left confronting the guilty couple, who remained\nstanding as if they did not accept their dismissal, and the\ndisappearance of Katharine had brought some change into the situation.\nSo, in his secret heart, Mr. Hilbery felt that it had, for he could not\nexplain his daughter s behavior to his own satisfaction.\n\n\"Uncle Trevor,\" Cassandra exclaimed impulsively, \"don t be angry,\nplease. I couldn t help it; I do beg you to forgive me.\"\n\nHer uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity, and still talked\nover her head as if she did not exist.\n\n\"I suppose you have communicated with the Otways,\" he said to Rodney\ngrimly.\n\n\"Uncle Trevor, we wanted to tell you,\" Cassandra replied for him. \"We\nwaited \" she looked appealingly at Rodney, who shook his head ever so\nslightly.\n\n\"Yes? What were you waiting for?\" her uncle asked sharply, looking at\nher at last.\n\nThe words died on her lips. It was apparent that she was straining her\nears as if to catch some sound outside the room that would come to her\nhelp. He received no answer. He listened, too.\n\n\"This is a most unpleasant business for all parties,\" he concluded,\nsinking into his chair again, hunching his shoulders and regarding the\nflames. He seemed to speak to himself, and Rodney and Cassandra looked\nat him in silence.\n\n\"Why don t you sit down?\" he said suddenly. He spoke gruffly, but the\nforce of his anger was evidently spent, or some preoccupation had\nturned his mood to other regions. While Cassandra accepted his\ninvitation, Rodney remained standing.\n\n\"I think Cassandra can explain matters better in my absence,\" he said,\nand left the room, Mr. Hilbery giving his assent by a slight nod of the\nhead.\n\nMeanwhile, in the dining-room next door, Denham and Katharine were once\nmore seated at the mahogany table. They seemed to be continuing a\nconversation broken off in the middle, as if each remembered the\nprecise point at which they had been interrupted, and was eager to go\non as quickly as possible. Katharine, having interposed a short account\nof the interview with her father, Denham made no comment, but said:\n\n\"Anyhow, there s no reason why we shouldn t see each other.\"\n\n\"Or stay together. It s only marriage that s out of the question,\"\nKatharine replied.\n\n\"But if I find myself coming to want you more and more?\"\n\n\"If our lapses come more and more often?\"\n\nHe sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.\n\n\"But at least,\" he renewed, \"we ve established the fact that my lapses\nare still in some odd way connected with you; yours have nothing to do\nwith me. Katharine,\" he added, his assumption of reason broken up by\nhis agitation, \"I assure you that we are in love what other people call\nlove. Remember that night. We had no doubts whatever then. We were\nabsolutely happy for half an hour. You had no lapse until the day\nafter; I had no lapse until yesterday morning. We ve been happy at\nintervals all day until I went off my head, and you, quite naturally,\nwere bored.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she exclaimed, as if the subject chafed her, \"I can t make you\nunderstand. It s not boredom I m never bored. Reality reality,\" she\nejaculated, tapping her finger upon the table as if to emphasize and\nperhaps explain her isolated utterance of this word. \"I cease to be\nreal to you. It s the faces in a storm again the vision in a hurricane.\nWe come together for a moment and we part. It s my fault, too. I m as\nbad as you are worse, perhaps.\"\n\nThey were trying to explain, not for the first time, as their weary\ngestures and frequent interruptions showed, what in their common\nlanguage they had christened their \"lapses\"; a constant source of\ndistress to them, in the past few days, and the immediate reason why\nRalph was on his way to leave the house when Katharine, listening\nanxiously, heard him and prevented him. What was the cause of these\nlapses? Either because Katharine looked more beautiful, or more\nstrange, because she wore something different, or said something\nunexpected, Ralph s sense of her romance welled up and overcame him\neither into silence or into inarticulate expressions, which Katharine,\nwith unintentional but invariable perversity, interrupted or\ncontradicted with some severity or assertion of prosaic fact. Then the\nvision disappeared, and Ralph expressed vehemently in his turn the\nconviction that he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her\nreality. If the lapse was on her side it took the form of gradual\ndetachment until she became completely absorbed in her own thoughts,\nwhich carried her away with such intensity that she sharply resented\nany recall to her companion s side. It was useless to assert that these\ntrances were always originated by Ralph himself, however little in\ntheir later stages they had to do with him. The fact remained that she\nhad no need of him and was very loath to be reminded of him. How, then,\ncould they be in love? The fragmentary nature of their relationship was\nbut too apparent.\n\nThus they sat depressed to silence at the dining-room table, oblivious\nof everything, while Rodney paced the drawing-room overhead in such\nagitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived possible,\nand Cassandra remained alone with her uncle. Ralph, at length, rose and\nwalked gloomily to the window. He pressed close to the pane. Outside\nwere truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the\nmind in loneliness, and never communicated to another. What worse\nsacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by\nseeking to impart it? Some movement behind him made him reflect that\nKatharine had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed\nof her spirit. He turned sharply to implore her help, when again he was\nstruck cold by her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon\nsome far object. As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came\nto him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into the\ndusky atmosphere. Their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough\ncomment upon the distance between their minds. Yet distant as she was,\nher presence by his side transformed the world. He saw himself\nperforming wonderful deeds of courage; saving the drowning, rescuing\nthe forlorn. Impatient with this form of egotism, he could not shake\noff the conviction that somehow life was wonderful, romantic, a master\nworth serving so long as she stood there. He had no wish that she\nshould speak; he did not look at her or touch her; she was apparently\ndeep in her own thoughts and oblivious of his presence.\n\nThe door opened without their hearing the sound. Mr. Hilbery looked\nround the room, and for a moment failed to discover the two figures in\nthe window. He started with displeasure when he saw them, and observed\nthem keenly before he appeared able to make up his mind to say\nanything. He made a movement finally that warned them of his presence;\nthey turned instantly. Without speaking, he beckoned to Katharine to\ncome to him, and, keeping his eyes from the region of the room where\nDenham stood, he shepherded her in front of him back to the study. When\nKatharine was inside the room he shut the study door carefully behind\nhim as if to secure himself from something that he disliked.\n\n\"Now, Katharine,\" he said, taking up his stand in front of the fire,\n\"you will, perhaps, have the kindness to explain \" She remained silent.\n\"What inferences do you expect me to draw?\" he said sharply.... \"You\ntell me that you are not engaged to Rodney; I see you on what appear to\nbe extremely intimate terms with another with Ralph Denham. What am I\nto conclude? Are you,\" he added, as she still said nothing, \"engaged to\nRalph Denham?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\nHis sense of relief was great; he had been certain that her answer\nwould have confirmed his suspicions, but that anxiety being set at\nrest, he was the more conscious of annoyance with her for her behavior.\n\n\"Then all I can say is that you ve very strange ideas of the proper way\nto behave.... People have drawn certain conclusions, nor am I\nsurprised.... The more I think of it the more inexplicable I find it,\"\nhe went on, his anger rising as he spoke. \"Why am I left in ignorance\nof what is going on in my own house? Why am I left to hear of these\nevents for the first time from my sister? Most disagreeable most\nupsetting. How I m to explain to your Uncle Francis but I wash my hands\nof it. Cassandra goes tomorrow. I forbid Rodney the house. As for the\nother young man, the sooner he makes himself scarce the better. After\nplacing the most implicit trust in you, Katharine \" He broke off,\ndisquieted by the ominous silence with which his words were received,\nand looked at his daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of\nmind which he had felt before, for the first time, this evening. He\nperceived once more that she was not attending to what he said, but was\nlistening, and for a moment he, too, listened for sounds outside the\nroom. His certainty that there was some understanding between Denham\nand Katharine returned, but with a most unpleasant suspicion that there\nwas something illicit about it, as the whole position between the young\npeople seemed to him gravely illicit.\n\n\"I ll speak to Denham,\" he said, on the impulse of his suspicion,\nmoving as if to go.\n\n\"I shall come with you,\" Katharine said instantly, starting forward.\n\n\"You will stay here,\" said her father.\n\n\"What are you going to say to him?\" she asked.\n\n\"I suppose I may say what I like in my own house?\" he returned.\n\n\"Then I go, too,\" she replied.\n\nAt these words, which seemed to imply a determination to go to go for\never, Mr. Hilbery returned to his position in front of the fire, and\nbegan swaying slightly from side to side without for the moment making\nany remark.\n\n\"I understood you to say that you were not engaged to him,\" he said at\nlength, fixing his eyes upon his daughter.\n\n\"We are not engaged,\" she said.\n\n\"It should be a matter of indifference to you, then, whether he comes\nhere or not I will not have you listening to other things when I am\nspeaking to you!\" he broke off angrily, perceiving a slight movement on\nher part to one side. \"Answer me frankly, what is your relationship\nwith this young man?\"\n\n\"Nothing that I can explain to a third person,\" she said obstinately.\n\n\"I will have no more of these equivocations,\" he replied.\n\n\"I refuse to explain,\" she returned, and as she said it the front door\nbanged to. \"There!\" she exclaimed. \"He is gone!\" She flashed such a\nlook of fiery indignation at her father that he lost his self-control\nfor a moment.\n\n\"For God s sake, Katharine, control yourself!\" he cried.\n\nShe looked for a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized\ndwelling-place. She glanced over the walls covered with books, as if\nfor a second she had forgotten the position of the door. Then she made\nas if to go, but her father laid his hand upon her shoulder. He\ncompelled her to sit down.\n\n\"These emotions have been very upsetting, naturally,\" he said. His\nmanner had regained all its suavity, and he spoke with a soothing\nassumption of paternal authority. \"You ve been placed in a very\ndifficult position, as I understand from Cassandra. Now let us come to\nterms; we will leave these agitating questions in peace for the\npresent. Meanwhile, let us try to behave like civilized beings. Let us\nread Sir Walter Scott. What d you say to  The Antiquary,  eh? Or  The\nBride of Lammermoor ?\"\n\nHe made his own choice, and before his daughter could protest or make\nher escape, she found herself being turned by the agency of Sir Walter\nScott into a civilized human being.\n\nYet Mr. Hilbery had grave doubts, as he read, whether the process was\nmore than skin-deep. Civilization had been very profoundly and\nunpleasantly overthrown that evening; the extent of the ruin was still\nundetermined; he had lost his temper, a physical disaster not to be\nmatched for the space of ten years or so; and his own condition\nurgently required soothing and renovating at the hands of the classics.\nHis house was in a state of revolution; he had a vision of unpleasant\nencounters on the staircase; his meals would be poisoned for days to\ncome; was literature itself a specific against such disagreeables? A\nnote of hollowness was in his voice as he read.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXIII\n\n\nConsidering that Mr. Hilbery lived in a house which was accurately\nnumbered in order with its fellows, and that he filled up forms, paid\nrent, and had seven more years of tenancy to run, he had an excuse for\nlaying down laws for the conduct of those who lived in his house, and\nthis excuse, though profoundly inadequate, he found useful during the\ninterregnum of civilization with which he now found himself faced. In\nobedience to those laws, Rodney disappeared; Cassandra was dispatched\nto catch the eleven-thirty on Monday morning; Denham was seen no more;\nso that only Katharine, the lawful occupant of the upper rooms,\nremained, and Mr. Hilbery thought himself competent to see that she did\nnothing further to compromise herself. As he bade her good morning next\nday he was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking, but, as\nhe reflected with some bitterness, even this was an advance upon the\nignorance of the previous mornings. He went to his study, wrote, tore\nup, and wrote again a letter to his wife, asking her to come back on\naccount of domestic difficulties which he specified at first, but in a\nlater draft more discreetly left unspecified. Even if she started the\nvery moment that she got it, he reflected, she would not be home till\nTuesday night, and he counted lugubriously the number of hours that he\nwould have to spend in a position of detestable authority alone with\nhis daughter.\n\nWhat was she doing now, he wondered, as he addressed the envelope to\nhis wife. He could not control the telephone. He could not play the\nspy. She might be making any arrangements she chose. Yet the thought\ndid not disturb him so much as the strange, unpleasant, illicit\natmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before.\nHis sense of discomfort was almost physical.\n\nHad he known it, Katharine was far enough withdrawn, both physically\nand spiritually, from the telephone. She sat in her room with the\ndictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before her, and\nall the pages which they had concealed for so many years arranged in a\npile. She worked with the steady concentration that is produced by the\nsuccessful effort to think down some unwelcome thought by means of\nanother thought. Having absorbed the unwelcome thought, her mind went\non with additional vigor, derived from the victory; on a sheet of paper\nlines of figures and symbols frequently and firmly written down marked\nthe different stages of its progress. And yet it was broad daylight;\nthere were sounds of knocking and sweeping, which proved that living\npeople were at work on the other side of the door, and the door, which\ncould be thrown open in a second, was her only protection against the\nworld. But she had somehow risen to be mistress in her own kingdom,\nassuming her sovereignty unconsciously.\n\nSteps approached her unheard. It is true that they were steps that\nlingered, divagated, and mounted with the deliberation natural to one\npast sixty whose arms, moreover, are full of leaves and blossoms; but\nthey came on steadily, and soon a tap of laurel boughs against the door\narrested Katharine s pencil as it touched the page. She did not move,\nhowever, and sat blank-eyed as if waiting for the interruption to\ncease. Instead, the door opened. At first, she attached no meaning to\nthe moving mass of green which seemed to enter the room independently\nof any human agency. Then she recognized parts of her mother s face and\nperson behind the yellow flowers and soft velvet of the palm-buds.\n\n\"From Shakespeare s tomb!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, dropping the entire\nmass upon the floor, with a gesture that seemed to indicate an act of\ndedication. Then she flung her arms wide and embraced her daughter.\n\n\"Thank God, Katharine!\" she exclaimed. \"Thank God!\" she repeated.\n\n\"You ve come back?\" said Katharine, very vaguely, standing up to\nreceive the embrace.\n\nAlthough she recognized her mother s presence, she was very far from\ntaking part in the scene, and yet felt it to be amazingly appropriate\nthat her mother should be there, thanking God emphatically for unknown\nblessings, and strewing the floor with flowers and leaves from\nShakespeare s tomb.\n\n\"Nothing else matters in the world!\" Mrs. Hilbery continued. \"Names\naren t everything; it s what we feel that s everything. I didn t want\nsilly, kind, interfering letters. I didn t want your father to tell me.\nI knew it from the first. I prayed that it might be so.\"\n\n\"You knew it?\" Katharine repeated her mother s words softly and\nvaguely, looking past her. \"How did you know it?\" She began, like a\nchild, to finger a tassel hanging from her mother s cloak.\n\n\"The first evening you told me, Katharine. Oh, and thousands of\ntimes dinner-parties talking about books the way he came into the\nroom your voice when you spoke of him.\"\n\nKatharine seemed to consider each of these proofs separately. Then she\nsaid gravely:\n\n\"I m not going to marry William. And then there s Cassandra \"\n\n\"Yes, there s Cassandra,\" said Mrs. Hilbery. \"I own I was a little\ngrudging at first, but, after all, she plays the piano so beautifully.\nDo tell me, Katharine,\" she asked impulsively, \"where did you go that\nevening she played Mozart, and you thought I was asleep?\"\n\nKatharine recollected with difficulty.\n\n\"To Mary Datchet s,\" she remembered.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Hilbery, with a slight note of disappointment in her\nvoice. \"I had my little romance my little speculation.\" She looked at\nher daughter. Katharine faltered beneath that innocent and penetrating\ngaze; she flushed, turned away, and then looked up with very bright\neyes.\n\n\"I m not in love with Ralph Denham,\" she said.\n\n\"Don t marry unless you re in love!\" said Mrs. Hilbery very quickly.\n\"But,\" she added, glancing momentarily at her daughter, \"aren t there\ndifferent ways, Katharine different ?\"\n\n\"We want to meet as often as we like, but to be free,\" Katharine\ncontinued.\n\n\"To meet here, to meet in his house, to meet in the street.\" Mrs.\nHilbery ran over these phrases as if she were trying chords that did\nnot quite satisfy her ear. It was plain that she had her sources of\ninformation, and, indeed, her bag was stuffed with what she called\n\"kind letters\" from the pen of her sister-in-law.\n\n\"Yes. Or to stay away in the country,\" Katharine concluded.\n\nMrs. Hilbery paused, looked unhappy, and sought inspiration from the\nwindow.\n\n\"What a comfort he was in that shop how he took me and found the ruins\nat once how _safe_ I felt with him \"\n\n\"Safe? Oh, no, he s fearfully rash he s always taking risks. He wants\nto throw up his profession and live in a little cottage and write\nbooks, though he hasn t a penny of his own, and there are any number of\nsisters and brothers dependent on him.\"\n\n\"Ah, he has a mother?\" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\n\n\"Yes. Rather a fine-looking old lady, with white hair.\" Katharine began\nto describe her visit, and soon Mrs. Hilbery elicited the facts that\nnot only was the house of excruciating ugliness, which Ralph bore\nwithout complaint, but that it was evident that every one depended on\nhim, and he had a room at the top of the house, with a wonderful view\nover London, and a rook.\n\n\"A wretched old bird in a corner, with half its feathers out,\" she\nsaid, with a tenderness in her voice that seemed to commiserate the\nsufferings of humanity while resting assured in the capacity of Ralph\nDenham to alleviate them, so that Mrs. Hilbery could not help\nexclaiming:\n\n\"But, Katharine, you _are_ in love!\" at which Katharine flushed, looked\nstartled, as if she had said something that she ought not to have said,\nand shook her head.\n\nHastily Mrs. Hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary\nhouse, and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between\nKeats and Coleridge in a lane, which tided over the discomfort of the\nmoment, and drew Katharine on to further descriptions and\nindiscretions. In truth, she found an extraordinary pleasure in being\nthus free to talk to some one who was equally wise and equally\nbenignant, the mother of her earliest childhood, whose silence seemed\nto answer questions that were never asked. Mrs. Hilbery listened\nwithout making any remark for a considerable time. She seemed to draw\nher conclusions rather by looking at her daughter than by listening to\nher, and, if cross-examined, she would probably have given a highly\ninaccurate version of Ralph Denham s life-history except that he was\npenniless, fatherless, and lived at Highgate all of which was much in\nhis favor. But by means of these furtive glances she had assured\nherself that Katharine was in a state which gave her, alternately, the\nmost exquisite pleasure and the most profound alarm.\n\nShe could not help ejaculating at last:\n\n\"It s all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays, if you\nthink the Church service a little florid which it is, though there are\nnoble things in it.\"\n\n\"But we don t want to be married,\" Katharine replied emphatically, and\nadded, \"Why, after all, isn t it perfectly possible to live together\nwithout being married?\"\n\nAgain Mrs. Hilbery looked discomposed, and, in her trouble, took up the\nsheets which were lying upon the table, and began turning them over\nthis way and that, and muttering to herself as she glanced:\n\n\"A plus B minus C equals _x y z_. It s so dreadfully ugly, Katharine.\nThat s what I feel so dreadfully ugly.\"\n\nKatharine took the sheets from her mother s hand and began shuffling\nthem absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show that\nher thoughts were intent upon some other matter.\n\n\"Well, I don t know about ugliness,\" she said at length.\n\n\"But he doesn t ask it of you?\" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. \"Not that grave\nyoung man with the steady brown eyes?\"\n\n\"He doesn t ask anything we neither of us ask anything.\"\n\n\"If I could help you, Katharine, by the memory of what I felt \"\n\n\"Yes, tell me what you felt.\"\n\nMrs. Hilbery, her eyes growing blank, peered down the enormously long\ncorridor of days at the far end of which the little figures of herself\nand her husband appeared fantastically attired, clasping hands upon a\nmoonlit beach, with roses swinging in the dusk.\n\n\"We were in a little boat going out to a ship at night,\" she began.\n\"The sun had set and the moon was rising over our heads. There were\nlovely silver lights upon the waves and three green lights upon the\nsteamer in the middle of the bay. Your father s head looked so grand\nagainst the mast. It was life, it was death. The great sea was round\nus. It was the voyage for ever and ever.\"\n\nThe ancient fairy-tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon Katharine s\nears. Yes, there was the enormous space of the sea; there were the\nthree green lights upon the steamer; the cloaked figures climbed up on\ndeck. And so, voyaging over the green and purple waters, past the\ncliffs and the sandy lagoons and through pools crowded with the masts\nof ships and the steeples of churches here they were. The river seemed\nto have brought them and deposited them here at this precise point. She\nlooked admiringly at her mother, that ancient voyager.\n\n\"Who knows,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, continuing her reveries, \"where we\nare bound for, or why, or who has sent us, or what we shall find who\nknows anything, except that love is our faith love \" she crooned, and\nthe soft sound beating through the dim words was heard by her daughter\nas the breaking of waves solemnly in order upon the vast shore that she\ngazed upon. She would have been content for her mother to repeat that\nword almost indefinitely a soothing word when uttered by another, a\nriveting together of the shattered fragments of the world. But Mrs.\nHilbery, instead of repeating the word love, said pleadingly:\n\n\"And you won t think those ugly thoughts again, will you, Katharine?\"\nat which words the ship which Katharine had been considering seemed to\nput into harbor and have done with its seafaring. Yet she was in great\nneed, if not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice, or, at least,\nof the opportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person\nso as to renew them in her own eyes.\n\n\"But then,\" she said, ignoring the difficult problem of ugliness, \"you\nknew you were in love; but we re different. It seems,\" she continued,\nfrowning a little as she tried to fix the difficult feeling, \"as if\nsomething came to an end suddenly gave out faded an illusion as if when\nwe think we re in love we make it up we imagine what doesn t exist.\nThat s why it s impossible that we should ever marry. Always to be\nfinding the other an illusion, and going off and forgetting about them,\nnever to be certain that you cared, or that he wasn t caring for some\none not you at all, the horror of changing from one state to the other,\nbeing happy one moment and miserable the next that s the reason why we\ncan t possibly marry. At the same time,\" she continued, \"we can t live\nwithout each other, because \" Mrs. Hilbery waited patiently for the\nsentence to be completed, but Katharine fell silent and fingered her\nsheet of figures.\n\n\"We have to have faith in our vision,\" Mrs. Hilbery resumed, glancing\nat the figures, which distressed her vaguely, and had some connection\nin her mind with the household accounts, \"otherwise, as you say \" She\ncast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment which were,\nperhaps, not altogether unknown to her.\n\n\"Believe me, Katharine, it s the same for every one for me, too for\nyour father,\" she said earnestly, and sighed. They looked together into\nthe abyss and, as the elder of the two, she recovered herself first and\nasked:\n\n\"But where is Ralph? Why isn t he here to see me?\"\n\nKatharine s expression changed instantly.\n\n\"Because he s not allowed to come here,\" she replied bitterly.\n\nMrs. Hilbery brushed this aside.\n\n\"Would there be time to send for him before luncheon?\" she asked.\n\nKatharine looked at her as if, indeed, she were some magician. Once\nmore she felt that instead of being a grown woman, used to advise and\ncommand, she was only a foot or two raised above the long grass and the\nlittle flowers and entirely dependent upon the figure of indefinite\nsize whose head went up into the sky, whose hand was in hers, for\nguidance.\n\n\"I m not happy without him,\" she said simply.\n\nMrs. Hilbery nodded her head in a manner which indicated complete\nunderstanding, and the immediate conception of certain plans for the\nfuture. She swept up her flowers, breathed in their sweetness, and,\nhumming a little song about a miller s daughter, left the room.\n\nThe case upon which Ralph Denham was engaged that afternoon was not\napparently receiving his full attention, and yet the affairs of the\nlate John Leake of Dublin were sufficiently confused to need all the\ncare that a solicitor could bestow upon them, if the widow Leake and\nthe five Leake children of tender age were to receive any pittance at\nall. But the appeal to Ralph s humanity had little chance of being\nheard to-day; he was no longer a model of concentration. The partition\nso carefully erected between the different sections of his life had\nbeen broken down, with the result that though his eyes were fixed upon\nthe last Will and Testament, he saw through the page a certain\ndrawing-room in Cheyne Walk.\n\nHe tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping\nup the partitions of the mind, until he could decently go home; but a\nlittle to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently, as if\nfrom outside, by Katharine, that he launched forth desperately into an\nimaginary interview with her. She obliterated a bookcase full of law\nreports, and the corners and lines of the room underwent a curious\nsoftening of outline like that which sometimes makes a room unfamiliar\nat the moment of waking from sleep. By degrees, a pulse or stress began\nto beat at regular intervals in his mind, heaping his thoughts into\nwaves to which words fitted themselves, and without much consciousness\nof what he was doing, he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what\nhad the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line. Not\nmany lines had been set down, however, before he threw away his pen as\nviolently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds, and tore the\npaper into many separate pieces. This was a sign that Katharine had\nasserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met\npoetically. Her remark was entirely destructive of poetry, since it was\nto the effect that poetry had nothing whatever to do with her; all her\nfriends spent their lives in making up phrases, she said; all his\nfeeling was an illusion, and next moment, as if to taunt him with his\nimpotence, she had sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no\naccount whatever of his existence. Ralph was roused by his passionate\nattempts to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing in\nthe middle of his little private room in Lincoln s Inn Fields at a\nconsiderable distance from Chelsea. The physical distance increased his\ndesperation. He began pacing in circles until the process sickened him,\nand then took a sheet of paper for the composition of a letter which,\nhe vowed before he began it, should be sent that same evening.\n\nIt was a difficult matter to put into words; poetry would have done it\nbetter justice, but he must abstain from poetry. In an infinite number\nof half-obliterated scratches he tried to convey to her the possibility\nthat although human beings are woefully ill-adapted for communication,\nstill, such communion is the best we know; moreover, they make it\npossible for each to have access to another world independent of\npersonal affairs, a world of law, of philosophy, or more strangely a\nworld such as he had had a glimpse of the other evening when together\nthey seemed to be sharing something, creating something, an ideal a\nvision flung out in advance of our actual circumstances. If this golden\nrim were quenched, if life were no longer circled by an illusion (but\nwas it an illusion after all?), then it would be too dismal an affair\nto carry to an end; so he wrote with a sudden spurt of conviction which\nmade clear way for a space and left at least one sentence standing\nwhole. Making every allowance for other desires, on the whole this\nconclusion appeared to him to justify their relationship. But the\nconclusion was mystical; it plunged him into thought. The difficulty\nwith which even this amount was written, the inadequacy of the words,\nand the need of writing under them and over them others which, after\nall, did no better, led him to leave off before he was at all satisfied\nwith his production, and unable to resist the conviction that such\nrambling would never be fit for Katharine s eye. He felt himself more\ncut off from her than ever. In idleness, and because he could do\nnothing further with words, he began to draw little figures in the\nblank spaces, heads meant to resemble her head, blots fringed with\nflames meant to represent perhaps the entire universe. From this\noccupation he was roused by the message that a lady wished to speak to\nhim. He had scarcely time to run his hands through his hair in order to\nlook as much like a solicitor as possible, and to cram his papers into\nhis pocket, already overcome with shame that another eye should behold\nthem, when he realized that his preparations were needless. The lady\nwas Mrs. Hilbery.\n\n\"I hope you re not disposing of somebody s fortune in a hurry,\" she\nremarked, gazing at the documents on his table, \"or cutting off an\nentail at one blow, because I want to ask you to do me a favor. And\nAnderson won t keep his horse waiting. (Anderson is a perfect tyrant,\nbut he drove my dear father to the Abbey the day they buried him.) I\nmade bold to come to you, Mr. Denham, not exactly in search of legal\nassistance (though I don t know who I d rather come to, if I were in\ntrouble), but in order to ask your help in settling some tiresome\nlittle domestic affairs that have arisen in my absence. I ve been to\nStratford-on-Avon (I must tell you all about that one of these days),\nand there I got a letter from my sister-in-law, a dear kind goose who\nlikes interfering with other people s children because she s got none\nof her own. (We re dreadfully afraid that she s going to lose the sight\nof one of her eyes, and I always feel that our physical ailments are so\napt to turn into mental ailments. I think Matthew Arnold says something\nof the same kind about Lord Byron.) But that s neither here nor there.\"\n\nThe effect of these parentheses, whether they were introduced for that\npurpose or represented a natural instinct on Mrs. Hilbery s part to\nembellish the bareness of her discourse, gave Ralph time to perceive\nthat she possessed all the facts of their situation and was come,\nsomehow, in the capacity of ambassador.\n\n\"I didn t come here to talk about Lord Byron,\" Mrs. Hilbery continued,\nwith a little laugh, \"though I know that both you and Katharine, unlike\nother young people of your generation, still find him worth reading.\"\nShe paused. \"I m so glad you ve made Katharine read poetry, Mr.\nDenham!\" she exclaimed, \"and feel poetry, and look poetry! She can t\ntalk it yet, but she will oh, she will!\"\n\nRalph, whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused to\narticulate, somehow contrived to say that there were moments when he\nfelt hopeless, utterly hopeless, though he gave no reason for this\nstatement on his part.\n\n\"But you care for her?\" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\n\n\"Good God!\" he exclaimed, with a vehemence which admitted of no\nquestion.\n\n\"It s the Church of England service you both object to?\" Mrs. Hilbery\ninquired innocently.\n\n\"I don t care a damn what service it is,\" Ralph replied.\n\n\"You would marry her in Westminster Abbey if the worst came to the\nworst?\" Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\n\n\"I would marry her in St. Paul s Cathedral,\" Ralph replied. His doubts\nupon this point, which were always roused by Katharine s presence, had\nvanished completely, and his strongest wish in the world was to be with\nher immediately, since every second he was away from her he imagined\nher slipping farther and farther from him into one of those states of\nmind in which he was unrepresented. He wished to dominate her, to\npossess her.\n\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery. She thanked Him for a variety of\nblessings: for the conviction with which the young man spoke; and not\nleast for the prospect that on her daughter s wedding-day the noble\ncadences, the stately periods, the ancient eloquence of the marriage\nservice would resound over the heads of a distinguished congregation\ngathered together near the very spot where her father lay quiescent\nwith the other poets of England. The tears filled her eyes; but she\nremembered simultaneously that her carriage was waiting, and with dim\neyes she walked to the door. Denham followed her downstairs.\n\nIt was a strange drive. For Denham it was without exception the most\nunpleasant he had ever taken. His only wish was to go as straightly and\nquickly as possible to Cheyne Walk; but it soon appeared that Mrs.\nHilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by\ninterposing various errands of her own. She stopped the carriage at\npost-offices, and coffee-shops, and shops of inscrutable dignity where\nthe aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends; and, catching\nsight of the dome of St. Paul s above the irregular spires of Ludgate\nHill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave directions that\nAnderson should drive them there. But Anderson had reasons of his own\nfor discouraging afternoon worship, and kept his horse s nose\nobstinately towards the west. After some minutes, Mrs. Hilbery realized\nthe situation, and accepted it good-humoredly, apologizing to Ralph for\nhis disappointment.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said, \"we ll go to St. Paul s another day, and it may\nturn out, though I can t promise that it _will_, that he ll take us\npast Westminster Abbey, which would be even better.\"\n\nRalph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say. Her mind and body\nboth seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing clouds\nrapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in a\nvaporous indistinctness. Meanwhile he remained conscious of his own\nconcentrated desire, his impotence to bring about anything he wished,\nand his increasing agony of impatience.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Hilbery pulled the cord with such decision that even\nAnderson had to listen to the order which she leant out of the window\nto give him. The carriage pulled up abruptly in the middle of Whitehall\nbefore a large building dedicated to one of our Government offices. In\na second Mrs. Hilbery was mounting the steps, and Ralph was left in too\nacute an irritation by this further delay even to speculate what errand\ntook her now to the Board of Education. He was about to jump from the\ncarriage and take a cab, when Mrs. Hilbery reappeared talking genially\nto a figure who remained hidden behind her.\n\n\"There s plenty of room for us all,\" she was saying. \"Plenty of room.\nWe could find space for FOUR of you, William,\" she added, opening the\ndoor, and Ralph found that Rodney had now joined their company. The two\nmen glanced at each other. If distress, shame, discomfort in its most\nacute form were ever visible upon a human face, Ralph could read them\nall expressed beyond the eloquence of words upon the face of his\nunfortunate companion. But Mrs. Hilbery was either completely unseeing\nor determined to appear so. She went on talking; she talked, it seemed\nto both the young men, to some one outside, up in the air. She talked\nabout Shakespeare, she apostrophized the human race, she proclaimed the\nvirtues of divine poetry, she began to recite verses which broke down\nin the middle. The great advantage of her discourse was that it was\nself-supporting. It nourished itself until Cheyne Walk was reached upon\nhalf a dozen grunts and murmurs.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, alighting briskly at her door, \"here we are!\"\n\nThere was something airy and ironical in her voice and expression as\nshe turned upon the doorstep and looked at them, which filled both\nRodney and Denham with the same misgivings at having trusted their\nfortunes to such an ambassador; and Rodney actually hesitated upon the\nthreshold and murmured to Denham:\n\n\"You go in, Denham. I...\" He was turning tail, but the door opening and\nthe familiar look of the house asserting its charm, he bolted in on the\nwake of the others, and the door shut upon his escape. Mrs. Hilbery led\nthe way upstairs. She took them to the drawing-room. The fire burnt as\nusual, the little tables were laid with china and silver. There was\nnobody there.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"Katharine s not here. She must be upstairs in her\nroom. You have something to say to her, I know, Mr. Denham. You can\nfind your way?\" she vaguely indicated the ceiling with a gesture of her\nhand. She had become suddenly serious and composed, mistress in her own\nhouse. The gesture with which she dismissed him had a dignity that\nRalph never forgot. She seemed to make him free with a wave of her hand\nto all that she possessed. He left the room.\n\nThe Hilberys  house was tall, possessing many stories and passages with\nclosed doors, all, once he had passed the drawing-room floor, unknown\nto Ralph. He mounted as high as he could and knocked at the first door\nhe came to.\n\n\"May I come in?\" he asked.\n\nA voice from within answered \"Yes.\"\n\nHe was conscious of a large window, full of light, of a bare table, and\nof a long looking-glass. Katharine had risen, and was standing with\nsome white papers in her hand, which slowly fluttered to the ground as\nshe saw her visitor. The explanation was a short one. The sounds were\ninarticulate; no one could have understood the meaning save themselves.\nAs if the forces of the world were all at work to tear them asunder\nthey sat, clasping hands, near enough to be taken even by the malicious\neye of Time himself for a united couple, an indivisible unit.\n\n\"Don t move, don t go,\" she begged of him, when he stooped to gather\nthe papers she had let fall. But he took them in his hands and, giving\nher by a sudden impulse his own unfinished dissertation, with its\nmystical conclusion, they read each other s compositions in silence.\n\nKatharine read his sheets to an end; Ralph followed her figures as far\nas his mathematics would let him. They came to the end of their tasks\nat about the same moment, and sat for a time in silence.\n\n\"Those were the papers you left on the seat at Kew,\" said Ralph at\nlength. \"You folded them so quickly that I couldn t see what they\nwere.\"\n\nShe blushed very deeply; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her\nface she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences, or\nRalph likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to\nfold themselves within reach of his hand. The moment of exposure had\nbeen exquisitely painful the light shed startlingly vivid. She had now\nto get used to the fact that some one shared her loneliness. The\nbewilderment was half shame and half the prelude to profound rejoicing.\nNor was she unconscious that on the surface the whole thing must appear\nof the utmost absurdity. She looked to see whether Ralph smiled, but\nfound his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the\nbelief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself,\nperhaps immeasurably, perhaps eternally. She hardly dared steep herself\nin the infinite bliss. But his glance seemed to ask for some assurance\nupon another point of vital interest to him. It beseeched her mutely to\ntell him whether what she had read upon his confused sheet had any\nmeaning or truth to her. She bent her head once more to the papers she\nheld.\n\n\"I like your little dot with the flames round it,\" she said\nmeditatively.\n\nRalph nearly tore the page from her hand in shame and despair when he\nsaw her actually contemplating the idiotic symbol of his most confused\nand emotional moments.\n\nHe was convinced that it could mean nothing to another, although\nsomehow to him it conveyed not only Katharine herself but all those\nstates of mind which had clustered round her since he first saw her\npouring out tea on a Sunday afternoon. It represented by its\ncircumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling\nglow which for him surrounded, inexplicably, so many of the objects of\nlife, softening their sharp outline, so that he could see certain\nstreets, books, and situations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the\nphysical eye. Did she smile? Did she put the paper down wearily,\ncondemning it not only for its inadequacy but for its falsity? Was she\ngoing to protest once more that he only loved the vision of her? But it\ndid not occur to her that this diagram had anything to do with her. She\nsaid simply, and in the same tone of reflection:\n\n\"Yes, the world looks something like that to me too.\"\n\nHe received her assurance with profound joy. Quietly and steadily there\nrose up behind the whole aspect of life that soft edge of fire which\ngave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the scene with shadows\nso deep and dark that one could fancy pushing farther into their\ndensity and still farther, exploring indefinitely. Whether there was\nany correspondence between the two prospects now opening before them\nthey shared the same sense of the impending future, vast, mysterious,\ninfinitely stored with undeveloped shapes which each would unwrap for\nthe other to behold; but for the present the prospect of the future was\nenough to fill them with silent adoration. At any rate, their further\nattempts to communicate articulately were interrupted by a knock on the\ndoor, and the entrance of a maid who, with a due sense of mystery,\nannounced that a lady wished to see Miss Hilbery, but refused to allow\nher name to be given.\n\nWhen Katharine rose, with a profound sigh, to resume her duties, Ralph\nwent with her, and neither of them formulated any guess, on their way\ndownstairs, as to who this anonymous lady might prove to be. Perhaps\nthe fantastic notion that she was a little black hunchback provided\nwith a steel knife, which she would plunge into Katharine s heart,\nappeared to Ralph more probable than another, and he pushed first into\nthe dining-room to avert the blow. Then he exclaimed \"Cassandra!\" with\nsuch heartiness at the sight of Cassandra Otway standing by the\ndining-room table that she put her finger to her lips and begged him to\nbe quiet.\n\n\"Nobody must know I m here,\" she explained in a sepulchral whisper. \"I\nmissed my train. I have been wandering about London all day. I can bear\nit no longer. Katharine, what am I to do?\"\n\nKatharine pushed forward a chair; Ralph hastily found wine and poured\nit out for her. If not actually fainting, she was very near it.\n\n\"William s upstairs,\" said Ralph, as soon as she appeared to be\nrecovered. \"I ll go and ask him to come down to you.\" His own happiness\nhad given him a confidence that every one else was bound to be happy\ntoo. But Cassandra had her uncle s commands and anger too vividly in\nher mind to dare any such defiance. She became agitated and said that\nshe must leave the house at once. She was not in a condition to go, had\nthey known where to send her. Katharine s common sense, which had been\nin abeyance for the past week or two, still failed her, and she could\nonly ask, \"But where s your luggage?\" in the vague belief that to take\nlodgings depended entirely upon a sufficiency of luggage. Cassandra s\nreply, \"I ve lost my luggage,\" in no way helped her to a conclusion.\n\n\"You ve lost your luggage,\" she repeated. Her eyes rested upon Ralph,\nwith an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany a profound\nthanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal devotion than a\nquestion about luggage. Cassandra perceived the look, and saw that it\nwas returned; her eyes filled with tears. She faltered in what she was\nsaying. She began bravely again to discuss the question of lodging when\nKatharine, who seemed to have communicated silently with Ralph, and\nobtained his permission, took her ruby ring from her finger and giving\nit to Cassandra, said: \"I believe it will fit you without any\nalteration.\"\n\nThese words would not have been enough to convince Cassandra of what\nshe very much wished to believe had not Ralph taken the bare hand in\nhis and demanded:\n\n\"Why don t you tell us you re glad?\" Cassandra was so glad that the\ntears ran down her cheeks. The certainty of Katharine s engagement not\nonly relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self-reproaches, but\nentirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately impaired\nher belief in Katharine. Her old faith came back to her. She seemed to\nbehold her with that curious intensity which she had lost; as a being\nwho walks just beyond our sphere, so that life in their presence is a\nheightened process, illuminating not only ourselves but a considerable\nstretch of the surrounding world. Next moment she contrasted her own\nlot with theirs and gave back the ring.\n\n\"I won t take that unless William gives it me himself,\" she said. \"Keep\nit for me, Katharine.\"\n\n\"I assure you everything s perfectly all right,\" said Ralph. \"Let me\ntell William \"\n\nHe was about, in spite of Cassandra s protest, to reach the door, when\nMrs. Hilbery, either warned by the parlor-maid or conscious with her\nusual prescience of the need for her intervention, opened the door and\nsmilingly surveyed them.\n\n\"My dear Cassandra!\" she exclaimed. \"How delightful to see you back\nagain! What a coincidence!\" she observed, in a general way. \"William is\nupstairs. The kettle boils over. Where s Katharine, I say? I go to\nlook, and I find Cassandra!\" She seemed to have proved something to her\nown satisfaction, although nobody felt certain what thing precisely it\nwas.\n\n\"I find Cassandra,\" she repeated.\n\n\"She missed her train,\" Katharine interposed, seeing that Cassandra was\nunable to speak.\n\n\"Life,\" began Mrs. Hilbery, drawing inspiration from the portraits on\nthe wall apparently, \"consists in missing trains and in finding \" But\nshe pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have boiled\ncompletely over everything.\n\nTo Katharine s agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was an\nenormous kettle, capable of deluging the house in its incessant showers\nof steam, the enraged representative of all those household duties\nwhich she had neglected. She ran hastily up to the drawing-room, and\nthe rest followed her, for Mrs. Hilbery put her arm round Cassandra and\ndrew her upstairs. They found Rodney observing the kettle with\nuneasiness but with such absence of mind that Katharine s catastrophe\nwas in a fair way to be fulfilled. In putting the matter straight no\ngreetings were exchanged, but Rodney and Cassandra chose seats as far\napart as possible, and sat down with an air of people making a very\ntemporary lodgment. Either Mrs. Hilbery was impervious to their\ndiscomfort, or chose to ignore it, or thought it high time that the\nsubject was changed, for she did nothing but talk about Shakespeare s\ntomb.\n\n\"So much earth and so much water and that sublime spirit brooding over\nit all,\" she mused, and went on to sing her strange, half-earthly song\nof dawns and sunsets, of great poets, and the unchanged spirit of noble\nloving which they had taught, so that nothing changes, and one age is\nlinked with another, and no one dies, and we all meet in spirit, until\nshe appeared oblivious of any one in the room. But suddenly her remarks\nseemed to contract the enormously wide circle in which they were\nsoaring and to alight, airily and temporarily, upon matters of more\nimmediate moment.\n\n\"Katharine and Ralph,\" she said, as if to try the sound. \"William and\nCassandra.\"\n\n\"I feel myself in an entirely false position,\" said William\ndesperately, thrusting himself into this breach in her reflections.\n\"I ve no right to be sitting here. Mr. Hilbery told me yesterday to\nleave the house. I d no intention of coming back again. I shall now \"\n\n\"I feel the same too,\" Cassandra interrupted. \"After what Uncle Trevor\nsaid to me last night \"\n\n\"I have put you into a most odious position,\" Rodney went on, rising\nfrom his seat, in which movement he was imitated simultaneously by\nCassandra. \"Until I have your father s consent I have no right to speak\nto you let alone in this house, where my conduct\" he looked at\nKatharine, stammered, and fell silent \"where my conduct has been\nreprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme,\" he forced himself to\ncontinue. \"I have explained everything to your mother. She is so\ngenerous as to try and make me believe that I have done no harm you\nhave convinced her that my behavior, selfish and weak as it was selfish\nand weak \" he repeated, like a speaker who has lost his notes.\n\nTwo emotions seemed to be struggling in Katharine; one the desire to\nlaugh at the ridiculous spectacle of William making her a formal speech\nacross the tea-table, the other a desire to weep at the sight of\nsomething childlike and honest in him which touched her inexpressibly.\nTo every one s surprise she rose, stretched out her hand, and said:\n\n\"You ve nothing to reproach yourself with you ve been always \" but here\nher voice died away, and the tears forced themselves into her eyes, and\nran down her cheeks, while William, equally moved, seized her hand and\npressed it to his lips. No one perceived that the drawing-room door had\nopened itself sufficiently to admit at least half the person of Mr.\nHilbery, or saw him gaze at the scene round the tea-table with an\nexpression of the utmost disgust and expostulation. He withdrew unseen.\nHe paused outside on the landing trying to recover his self-control and\nto decide what course he might with most dignity pursue. It was obvious\nto him that his wife had entirely confused the meaning of his\ninstructions. She had plunged them all into the most odious confusion.\nHe waited a moment, and then, with much preliminary rattling of the\nhandle, opened the door a second time. They had all regained their\nplaces; some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing and\nlooking under the table, so that his entrance passed momentarily\nunperceived. Katharine, with flushed cheeks, raised her head and said:\n\n\"Well, that s my last attempt at the dramatic.\"\n\n\"It s astonishing what a distance they roll,\" said Ralph, stooping to\nturn up the corner of the hearthrug.\n\n\"Don t trouble don t bother. We shall find it \" Mrs. Hilbery began, and\nthen saw her husband and exclaimed: \"Oh, Trevor, we re looking for\nCassandra s engagement-ring!\"\n\nMr. Hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet. Remarkably enough, the\nring had rolled to the very point where he stood. He saw the rubies\ntouching the tip of his boot. Such is the force of habit that he could\nnot refrain from stooping, with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at\nbeing the one to find what others were looking for, and, picking the\nring up, he presented it, with a bow that was courtly in the extreme,\nto Cassandra. Whether the making of a bow released automatically\nfeelings of complaisance and urbanity, Mr. Hilbery found his resentment\ncompletely washed away during the second in which he bent and\nstraightened himself. Cassandra dared to offer her cheek and received\nhis embrace. He nodded with some degree of stiffness to Rodney and\nDenham, who had both risen upon seeing him, and now altogether sat\ndown. Mrs. Hilbery seemed to have been waiting for the entrance of her\nhusband, and for this precise moment in order to put to him a question\nwhich, from the ardor with which she announced it, had evidently been\npressing for utterance for some time past.\n\n\"Oh, Trevor, please tell me, what was the date of the first performance\nof  Hamlet ?\"\n\nIn order to answer her Mr. Hilbery had to have recourse to the exact\nscholarship of William Rodney, and before he had given his excellent\nauthorities for believing as he believed, Rodney felt himself admitted\nonce more to the society of the civilized and sanctioned by the\nauthority of no less a person than Shakespeare himself. The power of\nliterature, which had temporarily deserted Mr. Hilbery, now came back\nto him, pouring over the raw ugliness of human affairs its soothing\nbalm, and providing a form into which such passions as he had felt so\npainfully the night before could be molded so that they fell roundly\nfrom the tongue in shapely phrases, hurting nobody. He was sufficiently\nsure of his command of language at length to look at Katharine and\nagain at Denham. All this talk about Shakespeare had acted as a\nsoporific, or rather as an incantation upon Katharine. She leaned back\nin her chair at the head of the tea-table, perfectly silent, looking\nvaguely past them all, receiving the most generalized ideas of human\nheads against pictures, against yellow-tinted walls, against curtains\nof deep crimson velvet. Denham, to whom he turned next, shared her\nimmobility under his gaze. But beneath his restraint and calm it was\npossible to detect a resolution, a will, set now with unalterable\ntenacity, which made such turns of speech as Mr. Hilbery had at command\nappear oddly irrelevant. At any rate, he said nothing. He respected the\nyoung man; he was a very able young man; he was likely to get his own\nway. He could, he thought, looking at his still and very dignified\nhead, understand Katharine s preference, and, as he thought this, he\nwas surprised by a pang of acute jealousy. She might have married\nRodney without causing him a twinge. This man she loved. Or what was\nthe state of affairs between them? An extraordinary confusion of\nemotion was beginning to get the better of him, when Mrs. Hilbery, who\nhad been conscious of a sudden pause in the conversation, and had\nlooked wistfully at her daughter once or twice, remarked:\n\n\"Don t stay if you want to go, Katharine. There s the little room over\nthere. Perhaps you and Ralph \"\n\n\"We re engaged,\" said Katharine, waking with a start, and looking\nstraight at her father. He was taken aback by the directness of the\nstatement; he exclaimed as if an unexpected blow had struck him. Had he\nloved her to see her swept away by this torrent, to have her taken from\nhim by this uncontrollable force, to stand by helpless, ignored? Oh,\nhow he loved her! How he loved her! He nodded very curtly to Denham.\n\n\"I gathered something of the kind last night,\" he said. \"I hope you ll\ndeserve her.\" But he never looked at his daughter, and strode out of\nthe room, leaving in the minds of the women a sense, half of awe, half\nof amusement, at the extravagant, inconsiderate, uncivilized male,\noutraged somehow and gone bellowing to his lair with a roar which still\nsometimes reverberates in the most polished of drawing-rooms. Then\nKatharine, looking at the shut door, looked down again, to hide her\ntears.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXIV\n\n\nThe lamps were lit; their luster reflected itself in the polished wood;\ngood wine was passed round the dinner-table; before the meal was far\nadvanced civilization had triumphed, and Mr. Hilbery presided over a\nfeast which came to wear more and more surely an aspect, cheerful,\ndignified, promising well for the future. To judge from the expression\nin Katharine s eyes it promised something but he checked the approach\nsentimentality. He poured out wine; he bade Denham help himself.\n\nThey went upstairs and he saw Katharine and Denham abstract themselves\ndirectly Cassandra had asked whether she might not play him\nsomething some Mozart? some Beethoven? She sat down to the piano; the\ndoor closed softly behind them. His eyes rested on the closed door for\nsome seconds unwaveringly, but, by degrees, the look of expectation\ndied out of them, and, with a sigh, he listened to the music.\n\nKatharine and Ralph were agreed with scarcely a word of discussion as\nto what they wished to do, and in a moment she joined him in the hall\ndressed for walking. The night was still and moonlit, fit for walking,\nthough any night would have seemed so to them, desiring more than\nanything movement, freedom from scrutiny, silence, and the open air.\n\n\"At last!\" she breathed, as the front door shut. She told him how she\nhad waited, fidgeted, thought he was never coming, listened for the\nsound of doors, half expected to see him again under the lamp-post,\nlooking at the house. They turned and looked at the serene front with\nits gold-rimmed windows, to him the shrine of so much adoration. In\nspite of her laugh and the little pressure of mockery on his arm, he\nwould not resign his belief, but with her hand resting there, her voice\nquickened and mysteriously moving in his ears, he had not time they had\nnot the same inclination other objects drew his attention.\n\nHow they came to find themselves walking down a street with many lamps,\ncorners radiant with light, and a steady succession of motor-omnibuses\nplying both ways along it, they could neither of them tell; nor account\nfor the impulse which led them suddenly to select one of these\nwayfarers and mount to the very front seat. After curving through\nstreets of comparative darkness, so narrow that shadows on the blinds\nwere pressed within a few feet of their faces, they came to one of\nthose great knots of activity where the lights, having drawn close\ntogether, thin out again and take their separate ways. They were borne\non until they saw the spires of the city churches pale and flat against\nthe sky.\n\n\"Are you cold?\" he asked, as they stopped by Temple Bar.\n\n\"Yes, I am rather,\" she replied, becoming conscious that the splendid\nrace of lights drawn past her eyes by the superb curving and swerving\nof the monster on which she sat was at an end. They had followed some\nsuch course in their thoughts too; they had been borne on, victors in\nthe forefront of some triumphal car, spectators of a pageant enacted\nfor them, masters of life. But standing on the pavement alone, this\nexaltation left them; they were glad to be alone together. Ralph stood\nstill for a moment to light his pipe beneath a lamp.\n\nShe looked at his face isolated in the little circle of light.\n\n\"Oh, that cottage,\" she said. \"We must take it and go there.\"\n\n\"And leave all this?\" he inquired.\n\n\"As you like,\" she replied. She thought, looking at the sky above\nChancery Lane, how the roof was the same everywhere; how she was now\nsecure of all that this lofty blue and its steadfast lights meant to\nher; reality, was it, figures, love, truth?\n\n\"I ve something on my mind,\" said Ralph abruptly. \"I mean I ve been\nthinking of Mary Datchet. We re very near her rooms now. Would you mind\nif we went there?\"\n\nShe had turned before she answered him. She had no wish to see any one\nto-night; it seemed to her that the immense riddle was answered; the\nproblem had been solved; she held in her hands for one brief moment the\nglobe which we spend our lives in trying to shape, round, whole, and\nentire from the confusion of chaos. To see Mary was to risk the\ndestruction of this globe.\n\n\"Did you treat her badly?\" she asked rather mechanically, walking on.\n\n\"I could defend myself,\" he said, almost defiantly. \"But what s the\nuse, if one feels a thing? I won t be with her a minute,\" he said.\n\"I ll just tell her \"\n\n\"Of course, you must tell her,\" said Katharine, and now felt anxious\nfor him to do what appeared to be necessary if he, too, were to hold\nhis globe for a moment round, whole, and entire.\n\n\"I wish I wish \" she sighed, for melancholy came over her and obscured\nat least a section of her clear vision. The globe swam before her as if\nobscured by tears.\n\n\"I regret nothing,\" said Ralph firmly. She leant towards him almost as\nif she could thus see what he saw. She thought how obscure he still was\nto her, save only that more and more constantly he appeared to her a\nfire burning through its smoke, a source of life.\n\n\"Go on,\" she said. \"You regret nothing \"\n\n\"Nothing nothing,\" he repeated.\n\n\"What a fire!\" she thought to herself. She thought of him blazing\nsplendidly in the night, yet so obscure that to hold his arm, as she\nheld it, was only to touch the opaque substance surrounding the flame\nthat roared upwards.\n\n\"Why nothing?\" she asked hurriedly, in order that he might say more and\nso make more splendid, more red, more darkly intertwined with smoke\nthis flame rushing upwards.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Katharine?\" he asked suspiciously, noticing\nher tone of dreaminess and the inapt words.\n\n\"I was thinking of you yes, I swear it. Always of you, but you take\nsuch strange shapes in my mind. You ve destroyed my loneliness. Am I to\ntell you how I see you? No, tell me tell me from the beginning.\"\n\nBeginning with spasmodic words, he went on to speak more and more\nfluently, more and more passionately, feeling her leaning towards him,\nlistening with wonder like a child, with gratitude like a woman. She\ninterrupted him gravely now and then.\n\n\"But it was foolish to stand outside and look at the windows. Suppose\nWilliam hadn t seen you. Would you have gone to bed?\"\n\nHe capped her reproof with wonderment that a woman of her age could\nhave stood in Kingsway looking at the traffic until she forgot.\n\n\"But it was then I first knew I loved you!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Tell me from the beginning,\" he begged her.\n\n\"No, I m a person who can t tell things,\" she pleaded. \"I shall say\nsomething ridiculous something about flames fires. No, I can t tell\nyou.\"\n\nBut he persuaded her into a broken statement, beautiful to him, charged\nwith extreme excitement as she spoke of the dark red fire, and the\nsmoke twined round it, making him feel that he had stepped over the\nthreshold into the faintly lit vastness of another mind, stirring with\nshapes, so large, so dim, unveiling themselves only in flashes, and\nmoving away again into the darkness, engulfed by it. They had walked by\nthis time to the street in which Mary lived, and being engrossed by\nwhat they said and partly saw, passed her staircase without looking up.\nAt this time of night there was no traffic and scarcely any\nfoot-passengers, so that they could pace slowly without interruption,\narm-in-arm, raising their hands now and then to draw something upon the\nvast blue curtain of the sky.\n\nThey brought themselves by these means, acting on a mood of profound\nhappiness, to a state of clear-sightedness where the lifting of a\nfinger had effect, and one word spoke more than a sentence. They lapsed\ngently into silence, traveling the dark paths of thought side by side\ntowards something discerned in the distance which gradually possessed\nthem both. They were victors, masters of life, but at the same time\nabsorbed in the flame, giving their life to increase its brightness, to\ntestify to their faith. Thus they had walked, perhaps, twice or three\ntimes up and down Mary Datchet s street before the recurrence of a\nlight burning behind a thin, yellow blind caused them to stop without\nexactly knowing why they did so. It burned itself into their minds.\n\n\"That is the light in Mary s room,\" said Ralph. \"She must be at home.\"\nHe pointed across the street. Katharine s eyes rested there too.\n\n\"Is she alone, working at this time of night? What is she working at?\"\nshe wondered. \"Why should we interrupt her?\" she asked passionately.\n\"What have we got to give her? She s happy too,\" she added. \"She has\nher work.\" Her voice shook slightly, and the light swam like an ocean\nof gold behind her tears.\n\n\"You don t want me to go to her?\" Ralph asked.\n\n\"Go, if you like; tell her what you like,\" she replied.\n\nHe crossed the road immediately, and went up the steps into Mary s\nhouse. Katharine stood where he left her, looking at the window and\nexpecting soon to see a shadow move across it; but she saw nothing; the\nblinds conveyed nothing; the light was not moved. It signaled to her\nacross the dark street; it was a sign of triumph shining there for\never, not to be extinguished this side of the grave. She brandished her\nhappiness as if in salute; she dipped it as if in reverence. \"How they\nburn!\" she thought, and all the darkness of London seemed set with\nfires, roaring upwards; but her eyes came back to Mary s window and\nrested there satisfied. She had waited some time before a figure\ndetached itself from the doorway and came across the road, slowly and\nreluctantly, to where she stood.\n\n\"I didn t go in I couldn t bring myself,\" he broke off. He had stood\noutside Mary s door unable to bring himself to knock; if she had come\nout she would have found him there, the tears running down his cheeks,\nunable to speak.\n\nThey stood for some moments, looking at the illuminated blinds, an\nexpression to them both of something impersonal and serene in the\nspirit of the woman within, working out her plans far into the\nnight her plans for the good of a world that none of them were ever to\nknow. Then their minds jumped on and other little figures came by in\nprocession, headed, in Ralph s view, by the figure of Sally Seal.\n\n\"Do you remember Sally Seal?\" he asked. Katharine bent her head.\n\n\"Your mother and Mary?\" he went on. \"Rodney and Cassandra? Old Joan up\nat Highgate?\" He stopped in his enumeration, not finding it possible to\nlink them together in any way that should explain the queer combination\nwhich he could perceive in them, as he thought of them. They appeared\nto him to be more than individuals; to be made up of many different\nthings in cohesion; he had a vision of an orderly world.\n\n\"It s all so easy it s all so simple,\" Katherine quoted, remembering\nsome words of Sally Seal s, and wishing Ralph to understand that she\nfollowed the track of his thought. She felt him trying to piece\ntogether in a laborious and elementary fashion fragments of belief,\nunsoldered and separate, lacking the unity of phrases fashioned by the\nold believers. Together they groped in this difficult region, where the\nunfinished, the unfulfilled, the unwritten, the unreturned, came\ntogether in their ghostly way and wore the semblance of the complete\nand the satisfactory. The future emerged more splendid than ever from\nthis construction of the present. Books were to be written, and since\nbooks must be written in rooms, and rooms must have hangings, and\noutside the windows there must be land, and an horizon to that land,\nand trees perhaps, and a hill, they sketched a habitation for\nthemselves upon the outline of great offices in the Strand and\ncontinued to make an account of the future upon the omnibus which took\nthem towards Chelsea; and still, for both of them, it swam miraculously\nin the golden light of a large steady lamp.\n\nAs the night was far advanced they had the whole of the seats on the\ntop of the omnibus to choose from, and the roads, save for an\noccasional couple, wearing even at midnight, an air of sheltering their\nwords from the public, were deserted. No longer did the shadow of a man\nsing to the shadow of a piano. A few lights in bedroom windows burnt\nbut were extinguished one by one as the omnibus passed them.\n\nThey dismounted and walked down to the river. She felt his arm stiffen\nbeneath her hand, and knew by this token that they had entered the\nenchanted region. She might speak to him, but with that strange tremor\nin his voice, those eyes blindly adoring, whom did he answer? What\nwoman did he see? And where was she walking, and who was her companion?\nMoments, fragments, a second of vision, and then the flying waters, the\nwinds dissipating and dissolving; then, too, the recollection from\nchaos, the return of security, the earth firm, superb and brilliant in\nthe sun. From the heart of his darkness he spoke his thanksgiving; from\na region as far, as hidden, she answered him. On a June night the\nnightingales sing, they answer each other across the plain; they are\nheard under the window among the trees in the garden. Pausing, they\nlooked down into the river which bore its dark tide of waters,\nendlessly moving, beneath them. They turned and found themselves\nopposite the house. Quietly they surveyed the friendly place, burning\nits lamps either in expectation of them or because Rodney was still\nthere talking to Cassandra. Katharine pushed the door half open and\nstood upon the threshold. The light lay in soft golden grains upon the\ndeep obscurity of the hushed and sleeping household. For a moment they\nwaited, and then loosed their hands. \"Good night,\" he breathed. \"Good\nnight,\" she murmured back to him.",
