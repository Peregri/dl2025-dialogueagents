        "raw text": " II\n\n\nAbandoning his bicycle, which fell before a servant could catch\nit, the young man sprang up on to the verandah. He was all\nanimation. \"Hamidullah, Hamidullah! am I late?\" he cried.\n\n\"Do not apologize,\" said his host. \"You are always late.\"\n\n\"Kindly answer my question. Am I late? Has Mahmoud Ali eaten all\nthe food? If so I go elsewhere. Mr. Mahmoud Ali, how are you?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dr. Aziz, I am dying.\"\n\n\"Dying before your dinner? Oh, poor Mahmoud Ali!\"\n\n\"Hamidullah here is actually dead. He passed away just as you rode\nup on your bike.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" said the other. \"Imagine us both as addressing\nyou from another and a happier world.\"\n\n\"Does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier\nworld of yours?\"\n\n\"Aziz, don't chatter. We are having a very sad talk.\"\n\nThe hookah had been packed too tight, as was usual in his friend's\nhouse, and bubbled sulkily. He coaxed it. Yielding at last, the\ntobacco jetted up into his lungs and nostrils, driving out the\nsmoke of burning cow dung that had filled them as he rode through\nthe bazaar. It was delicious. He lay in a trance, sensuous but\nhealthy, through which the talk of the two others did not seem\nparticularly sad   they were discussing as to whether or no it is\npossible to be friends with an Englishman. Mahmoud Ali argued that\nit was not, Hamidullah disagreed, but with so many reservations\nthat there was no friction between them. Delicious indeed to lie\non the broad verandah with the moon rising in front and the servants\npreparing dinner behind, and no trouble happening.\n\n\"Well, look at my own experience this morning.\"\n\n\"I only contend that it is possible in England,\" replied Hamidullah,\nwho had been to that country long ago, before the big rush, and\nhad received a cordial welcome at Cambridge.\n\n\"It is impossible here. Aziz! The red-nosed boy has again insulted\nme in Court. I do not blame him. He was told that he ought to\ninsult me. Until lately he was quite a nice boy, but the others\nhave got hold of him.\"\n\n\"Yes, they have no chance here, that is my point. They come out\nintending to be gentlemen, and are told it will not do. Look at\nLesley, look at Blakiston, now it is your red-nosed boy, and\nFielding will go next. Why, I remember when Turton came out first.\nIt was in another part of the Province. You fellows will not\nbelieve me, but I have driven with Turton in his carriage   Turton!\nOh yes, we were once quite intimate. He has shown me his stamp\ncollection.\"\n\n\"He would expect you to steal it now. Turton! But red-nosed boy\nwill be far worse than Turton!\"\n\n\"I do not think so. They all become exactly the same, not worse,\nnot better. I give any Englishman two years, be he Turton or\nBurton. It is only the difference of a letter. And I give any\nEnglishwoman six months. All are exactly alike. Do you not agree\nwith me?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" replied Mahmoud Ali, entering into the bitter fun, and\nfeeling both pain and amusement at each word that was uttered. \"For\nmy own part I find such profound differences among our rulers.\nRed-nose mumbles, Turton talks distinctly, Mrs. Turton takes\nbribes, Mrs. Red-nose does not and cannot, because so far there is\nno Mrs. Red-nose.\"\n\n\"Bribes?\"\n\n\"Did you not know that when they were lent to Central India over\na Canal Scheme, some Rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in\nsolid gold so that the water should run through his state.\"\n\n\"And does it?\"\n\n\"No, that is where Mrs. Turton is so skilful. When we poor blacks\ntake bribes, we perform what we are bribed to perform, and the law\ndiscovers us in consequence. The English take and do nothing. I\nadmire them.\"\n\n\"We all admire them. Aziz, please pass me the hookah.\"\n\n\"Oh, not yet   hookah is so jolly now.\"\n\n\"You are a very selfish boy.\" He raised his voice suddenly, and\nshouted for dinner. Servants shouted back that it was ready. They\nmeant that they wished it was ready, and were so understood, for\nnobody moved. Then Hamidullah continued, but with changed manner\nand evident emotion.\n\n\"But take my case   the case of young Hugh Bannister. Here is the\nson of my dear, my dead friends, the Reverend and Mrs. Bannister,\nwhose goodness to me in England I shall never forget or describe.\nThey were father and mother to me, I talked to them as I do now.\nIn the vacations their Rectory became my home. They entrusted all\ntheir children to me   I often carried little Hugh about   I took him\nup to the Funeral of Queen Victoria, and held him in my arms above\nthe crowd.\"\n\n\"Queen Victoria was different,\" murmured Mahmoud Ali.\n\n\"I learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at\nCawnpore. Imagine how I long to see him and to pay his fare that\nthis house may be his home. But it is useless. The other\nAnglo-Indians will have got hold of him long ago. He will probably\nthink that I want something, and I cannot face that from the son\nof my old friends. Oh, what in this country has gone wrong with\neverything, Vakil Sahib? I ask you.\"\n\nAziz joined in. \"Why talk about the English? Brrrr . . . ! Why be\neither friends with the fellows or not friends? Let us shut them\nout and be jolly. Queen Victoria and Mrs. Bannister were the only\nexceptions, and they're dead.\"\n\n\"No, no, I do not admit that, I have met others.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Mahmoud Ali, unexpectedly veering. \"All ladies\nare far from alike.\" Their mood was changed, and they recalled\nlittle kindnesses and courtesies. \"She said    Thank you so much' in\nthe most natural way.\" \"She offered me a lozenge when the dust\nirritated my throat.\" Hamidullah could remember more important\nexamples of angelic ministration, but the other, who only knew\nAnglo-India, had to ransack his memory for scraps, and it was not\nsurprising that he should return to \"But of course all this is\nexceptional. The exception does not prove the rule. The average\nwoman is like Mrs. Turton, and, Aziz, you know what she is.\" Aziz\ndid not know, but said he did. He too generalized from his\ndisappointments   it is difficult for members of a subject race to\ndo otherwise. Granted the exceptions, he agreed that all Englishwomen\nare haughty and venal. The gleam passed from the conversation,\nwhose wintry surface unrolled and expanded interminably.\n\nA servant announced dinner. They ignored him. The elder men had\nreached their eternal politics, Aziz drifted into the garden. The\ntrees smelt sweet   green-blossomed champak   and scraps of Persian\npoetry came into his head. Dinner, dinner, dinner . . . but when\nhe returned to the house for it, Mahmoud Ali had drifted away in\nhis turn, to speak to his sais. \"Come and see my wife a little\nthen,\" said Hamidullah, and they spent twenty minutes behind the\npurdah. Hamidullah Begum was a distant aunt of Aziz, and the only\nfemale relative he had in Chandrapore, and she had much to say to\nhim on this occasion about a family circumcision that had been\ncelebrated with imperfect pomp. It was difficult to get away,\nbecause until they had had their dinner she would not begin hers,\nand consequently prolonged her remarks in case they should suppose\nshe was impatient. Having censured the circumcision, she bethought\nher of kindred topics, and asked Aziz when he was going to be\nmarried.\n\nRespectful but irritated, he answered, \"Once is enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, he has done his duty,\" said Hamidullah. \"Do not tease him\nso. He carries on his family, two boys and their sister.\"\n\n\"Aunt, they live most comfortably with my wife's mother, where she\nwas living when she died. I can see them whenever I like. They are\nsuch very, very small children.\"\n\n\"And he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a\nlow-grade clerk, and tells no one the reason. What more do you\nrequire him to do?\"\n\nBut this was not Hamidullah Begum's point, and having courteously\nchanged the conversation for a few moments she returned and made\nit. She said, \"What is to become of all our daughters if men refuse\nto marry? They will marry beneath them, or      \" And she began the\noft-told tale of a lady of Imperial descent who could find no\nhusband in the narrow circle where her pride permitted her to mate,\nand had lived on unwed, her age now thirty, and would die unwed,\nfor no one would have her now. While the tale was in progress, it\nconvinced the two men, the tragedy seemed a slur on the whole\ncommunity; better polygamy almost, than that a woman should die\nwithout the joys God has intended her to receive. Wedlock,\nmotherhood, power in the house   for what else is she born, and how\ncan the man who has denied them to her stand up to face her creator\nand his own at the last day? Aziz took his leave saying \"Perhaps\n. . . but later . . .\"    his invariable reply to such an appeal.\n\n\"You mustn't put off what you think right,\" said Hamidullah. \"That\nis why India is in such a plight, because we put off things.\" But\nseeing that his young relative looked worried, he added a few\nsoothing words, and thus wiped out any impression that his wife\nmight have made.\n\nDuring their absence, Mahmoud Ali had gone off in his carriage\nleaving a message that he should be back in five minutes, but they\nwere on no account to wait. They sat down to meat with a distant\ncousin of the house, Mohammed Latif, who lived on Hamidullah's\nbounty and who occupied the position neither of a servant nor of\nan equal. He did not speak unless spoken to, and since no one spoke\nkept unoffended silence. Now and then he belched, in compliment to\nthe richness of the food. A gentle, happy and dishonest old man;\nall his life he had never done a stroke of work. So long as some\none of his relatives had a house he was sure of a home, and it was\nunlikely that so large a family would all go bankrupt. His wife\nled a similar existence some hundreds of miles away   he did not\nvisit her, owing to the expense of the railway ticket. Presently\nAziz chaffed him, also the servants, and then began quoting poetry,\nPersian, Urdu, a little Arabic. His memory was good, and for so\nyoung a man he had read largely; the themes he preferred were the\ndecay of Islam and the brevity of love. They listened delighted,\nfor they took the public view of poetry, not the private which\nobtains in England. It never bored them to hear words, words; they\nbreathed them with the cool night air, never stopping to analyse;\nthe name of the poet, Hafiz, Hali, Iqbal, was sufficient guarantee.\nIndia   a hundred Indias   whispered outside beneath the indifferent\nmoon, but for the time India seemed one and their own, and they\nregained their departed greatness by hearing its departure lamented,\nthey felt young again because reminded that youth must fly. A\nservant in scarlet interrupted him; he was the chuprassi of the\nCivil Surgeon, and he handed Aziz a note.\n\n\"Old Callendar wants to see me at his bungalow,\" he said, not\nrising. \"He might have the politeness to say why.\"\n\n\"Some case, I daresay.\"\n\n\"I daresay not, I daresay nothing. He has found out our dinner\nhour, that's all, and chooses to interrupt us every time, in order\nto show his power.\"\n\n\"On the one hand he always does this, on the other it may be a\nserious case, and you cannot know,\" said Hamidullah, considerately\npaving the way towards obedience. \"Had you not better clean your\nteeth after pan?\"\n\n\"If my teeth are to be cleaned, I don't go at all. I am an Indian,\nit is an Indian habit to take pan. The Civil Surgeon must put up\nwith it. Mohammed Latif, my bike, please.\"\n\nThe poor relation got up. Slightly immersed in the realms of\nmatter, he laid his hand on the bicycle's saddle, while a servant\ndid the actual wheeling. Between them they took it over a tintack.\nAziz held his hands under the ewer, dried them, fitted on his green\nfelt hat, and then with unexpected energy whizzed out of Hamidullah's\ncompound.\n\n\"Aziz, Aziz, imprudent boy. . . .\" But he was far down the bazaar,\nriding furiously. He had neither light nor bell nor had he a brake,\nbut what use are such adjuncts in a land where the cyclist's only\nhope is to coast from face to face, and just before he collides\nwith each it vanishes? And the city was fairly empty at this hour.\nWhen his tyre went flat, he leapt off and shouted for a tonga.\n\nHe did not at first find one, and he had also to dispose of his\nbicycle at a friend's house. He dallied furthermore to clean his\nteeth. But at last he was rattling towards the civil lines, with\na vivid sense of speed. As he entered their arid tidiness,\ndepression suddenly seized him. The roads, named after victorious\ngenerals and intersecting at right angles, were symbolic of the\nnet Great Britain had thrown over India. He felt caught in their\nmeshes. When he turned into Major Callendar's compound he could\nwith difficulty restrain himself from getting down from the tonga\nand approaching the bungalow on foot, and this not because his soul\nwas servile but because his feelings   the sensitive edges of\nhim   feared a gross snub. There had been a \"case\" last year   an\nIndian gentleman had driven up to an official's house and been\nturned back by the servants and been told to approach more\nsuitably   only one case among thousands of visits to hundreds of\nofficials, but its fame spread wide. The young man shrank from a\nrepetition of it. He compromised, and stopped the driver just\noutside the flood of light that fell across the verandah.\n\nThe Civil Surgeon was out.\n\n\"But the sahib has left me some message?\"\n\nThe servant returned an indifferent \"No.\" Aziz was in despair. It\nwas a servant whom he had forgotten to tip, and he could do nothing\nnow because there were people in the hall. He was convinced that\nthere was a message, and that the man was withholding it out of\nrevenge. While they argued, the people came out. Both were ladies.\nAziz lifted his hat. The first, who was in evening dress, glanced\nat the Indian and turned instinctively away.\n\n\"Mrs. Lesley, it _is_ a tonga,\" she cried.\n\n\"Ours?\" enquired the second, also seeing Aziz, and doing likewise.\n\n\"Take the gifts the gods provide, anyhow,\" she screeched, and both\njumped in. \"O Tonga wallah, club, club. Why doesn't the fool go?\"\n\n\"Go, I will pay you to-morrow,\" said Aziz to the driver, and as\nthey went off he called courteously, \"You are most welcome, ladies.\"\nThey did not reply, being full of their own affairs.\n\nSo it had come, the usual thing   just as Mahmoud Ali said. The\ninevitable snub   his bow ignored, his carriage taken. It might have\nbeen worse, for it comforted him somehow that Mesdames Callendar\nand Lesley should both be fat and weigh the tonga down behind.\nBeautiful women would have pained him. He turned to the servant,\ngave him a couple of rupees, and asked again whether there was a\nmessage. The man, now very civil, returned the same answer. Major\nCallendar had driven away half an hour before.\n\n\"Saying nothing?\"\n\nHe had as a matter of fact said, \"Damn Aziz\"   words that the servant\nunderstood, but was too polite to repeat. One can tip too much as\nwell as too little, indeed the coin that buys the exact truth has\nnot yet been minted.\n\n\"Then I will write him a letter.\"\n\nHe was offered the use of the house, but was too dignified to enter\nit. Paper and ink were brought on to the verandah. He began: \"Dear\nSir,   At your express command I have hastened as a subordinate\nshould      \" and then stopped. \"Tell him I have called, that is\nsufficient,\" he said, tearing the protest up. \"Here is my card.\nCall me a tonga.\"\n\n\"Huzoor, all are at the club.\"\n\n\"Then telephone for one down to the railway station.\" And since\nthe man hastened to do this he said, \"Enough, enough, I prefer to\nwalk.\" He commandeered a match and lit a cigarette. These\nattentions, though purchased, soothed him. They would last as long\nas he had rupees, which is something. But to shake the dust of\nAnglo-India off his feet! To escape from the net and be back among\nmanners and gestures that he knew! He began a walk, an unwonted\nexercise.\n\nHe was an athletic little man, daintily put together, but really\nvery strong. Nevertheless walking fatigued him, as it fatigues\neveryone in India except the new-comer. There is something hostile\nin that soil. It either yields, and the foot sinks into a\ndepression, or else it is unexpectedly rigid and sharp, pressing\nstones or crystals against the tread. A series of these little\nsurprises exhausts; and he was wearing pumps, a poor preparation\nfor any country. At the edge of the civil station he turned into\na mosque to rest.\n\nHe had always liked this mosque. It was gracious, and the\narrangement pleased him. The courtyard   entered through a ruined\ngate   contained an ablution tank of fresh clear water, which was\nalways in motion, being indeed part of a conduit that supplied the\ncity. The courtyard was paved with broken slabs. The covered part\nof the mosque was deeper than is usual; its effect was that of an\nEnglish parish church whose side has been taken out. Where he sat,\nhe looked into three arcades whose darkness was illuminated by a\nsmall hanging lamp and by the moon. The front   in full moonlight   had\nthe appearance of marble, and the ninety-nine names of God on the\nfrieze stood out black, as the frieze stood out white against the\nsky. The contest between this dualism and the contention of shadows\nwithin pleased Aziz, and he tried to symbolize the whole into some\ntruth of religion or love. A mosque by winning his approval let\nloose his imagination. The temple of another creed, Hindu,\nChristian, or Greek, would have bored him and failed to awaken his\nsense of beauty. Here was Islam, his own country, more than a\nFaith, more than a battle-cry, more, much more . . . Islam, an\nattitude towards life both exquisite and durable, where his body\nand his thoughts found their home.\n\nHis seat was the low wall that bounded the courtyard on the left.\nThe ground fell away beneath him towards the city, visible as a\nblur of trees, and in the stillness he heard many small sounds. On\nthe right, over in the club, the English community contributed an\namateur orchestra. Elsewhere some Hindus were drumming   he knew they\nwere Hindus, because the rhythm was uncongenial to him,   and others\nwere bewailing a corpse   he knew whose, having certified it in the\nafternoon. There were owls, the Punjab mail . . . and flowers smelt\ndeliciously in the station-master's garden. But the mosque   that\nalone signified, and he returned to it from the complex appeal of\nthe night, and decked it with meanings the builder had never\nintended. Some day he too would build a mosque, smaller than this\nbut in perfect taste, so that all who passed by should experience\nthe happiness he felt now. And near it, under a low dome, should\nbe his tomb, with a Persian inscription:\n\n  Alas, without me for thousands of years\n  The Rose will blossom and the Spring will bloom,\n  But those who have secretly understood my heart   \n  They will approach and visit the grave where I lie.\n\nHe had seen the quatrain on the tomb of a Deccan king, and regarded\nit as profound philosophy   he always held pathos to be profound.\nThe secret understanding of the heart! He repeated the phrase with\ntears in his eyes, and as he did so one of the pillars of the\nmosque seemed to quiver. It swayed in the gloom and detached\nitself. Belief in ghosts ran in his blood, but he sat firm. Another\npillar moved, a third, and then an Englishwoman stepped out into\nthe moonlight. Suddenly he was furiously angry and shouted: \"Madam!\nMadam! Madam!\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" the woman gasped.\n\n\"Madam, this is a mosque, you have no right here at all; you should\nhave taken off your shoes; this is a holy place for Moslems.\"\n\n\"I have taken them off.\"\n\n\"You have?\"\n\n\"I left them at the entrance.\"\n\n\"Then I ask your pardon.\"\n\nStill startled, the woman moved out, keeping the ablution-tank\nbetween them. He called after her, \"I am truly sorry for speaking.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was right, was I not? If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?\"\n\n\"Of course, but so few ladies take the trouble, especially if\nthinking no one is there to see.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference. God is here.\"\n\n\"Madam!\"\n\n\"Please let me go.\"\n\n\"Oh, can I do you some service now or at any time?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, really none   good night.\"\n\n\"May I know your name?\"\n\nShe was now in the shadow of the gateway, so that he could not see\nher face, but she saw his, and she said with a change of voice,\n\"Mrs. Moore.\"\n\n\"Mrs.      \" Advancing, he found that she was old.\n\nA fabric bigger than the mosque fell to pieces, and he did not know\nwhether he was glad or sorry. She was older than Hamidullah Begum,\nwith a red face and white hair. Her voice had deceived him.\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, I am afraid I startled you. I shall tell my\ncommunity   our friends   about you. That God is here   very good, very\nfine indeed. I think you are newly arrived in India.\"\n\n\"Yes   how did you know?\"\n\n\"By the way you address me. No, but can I call you a carriage?\"\n\n\"I have only come from the club. They are doing a play that I have\nseen in London, and it was so hot.\"\n\n\"What was the name of the play?\"\n\n_\"Cousin Kate.\"_\n\n\"I think you ought not to walk at night alone, Mrs. Moore. There\nare bad characters about and leopards may come across from the\nMarabar Hills. Snakes also.\"\n\nShe exclaimed; she had forgotten the snakes.\n\n\"For example, a six-spot beetle,\" he continued, \"You pick it up,\nit bites, you die.\"\n\n\"But you walk about yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am used to it.\"\n\n\"Used to snakes?\"\n\nThey both laughed. \"I'm a doctor,\" he said. \"Snakes don't dare bite\nme.\" They sat down side by side in the entrance, and slipped on\ntheir evening shoes. \"Please may I ask you a question now? Why do\nyou come to India at this time of year, just as the cold weather\nis ending?\"\n\n\"I intended to start earlier, but there was an unavoidable delay.\"\n\n\"It will soon be so unhealthy for you! And why ever do you come to\nChandrapore?\"\n\n\"To visit my son. He is the City Magistrate here.\"\n\n\"Oh no, excuse me, that is quite impossible. Our City Magistrate's\nname is Mr. Heaslop. I know him intimately.\"\n\n\"He's my son all the same,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"But, Mrs. Moore, how can he be?\"\n\n\"I was married twice.\"\n\n\"Yes, now I see, and your first husband died.\"\n\n\"He did, and so did my second husband.\"\n\n\"Then we are in the same box,\" he said cryptically. \"Then is the\nCity Magistrate the entire of your family now?\"\n\n\"No, there are the younger ones   Ralph and Stella in England.\"\n\n\"And the gentleman here, is he Ralph and Stella's half-brother?\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, this is all extremely strange, because like yourself\nI have also two sons and a daughter. Is not this the same box with\na vengeance?\"\n\n\"What are their names? Not also Ronny, Ralph, and Stella, surely?\"\n\nThe suggestion delighted him. \"No, indeed. How funny it sounds!\nTheir names are quite different and will surprise you. Listen,\nplease. I am about to tell you my children's names. The first is\ncalled Ahmed, the second is called Karim, the third   she is the\neldest   Jamila. Three children are enough. Do not you agree with\nme?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nThey were both silent for a little, thinking of their respective\nfamilies. She sighed and rose to go.\n\n\"Would you care to see over the Minto Hospital one morning?\" he\nenquired. \"I have nothing else to offer at Chandrapore.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I have seen it already, or I should have liked to come\nwith you very much.\"\n\n\"I suppose the Civil Surgeon took you.\"\n\n\"Yes, and Mrs. Callendar.\"\n\nHis voice altered. \"Ah! A very charming lady.\"\n\n\"Possibly, when one knows her better.\"\n\n\"What? What? You didn't like her?\"\n\n\"She was certainly intending to be kind, but I did not find her\nexactly charming.\"\n\nHe burst out with: \"She has just taken my tonga without my\npermission   do you call that being charming?   and Major Callendar\ninterrupts me night after night from where I am dining with my\nfriends and I go at once, breaking up a most pleasant entertainment,\nand he is not there and not even a message. Is this charming, pray?\nBut what does it matter? I can do nothing and he knows it. I am\njust a subordinate, my time is of no value, the verandah is good\nenough for an Indian, yes, yes, let him stand, and Mrs. Callendar\ntakes my carriage and cuts me dead . . .\"\n\nShe listened.\n\nHe was excited partly by his wrongs, but much more by the knowledge\nthat someone sympathized with them. It was this that led him to\nrepeat, exaggerate, contradict. She had proved her sympathy by\ncriticizing her fellow-countrywoman to him, but even earlier he\nhad known. The flame that not even beauty can nourish was springing\nup, and though his words were querulous his heart began to glow\nsecretly. Presently it burst into speech.\n\n\"You understand me, you know what others feel. Oh, if others\nresembled you!\"\n\nRather surprised, she replied: \"I don't think I understand people\nvery well. I only know whether I like or dislike them.\"\n\n\"Then you are an Oriental.\"\n\nShe accepted his escort back to the club, and said at the gate that\nshe wished she was a member, so that she could have asked him in.\n\n\"Indians are not allowed into the Chandrapore Club even as guests,\"\nhe said simply. He did not expatiate on his wrongs now, being\nhappy. As he strolled downhill beneath the lovely moon, and again\nsaw the lovely mosque, he seemed to own the land as much as anyone\nowned it. What did it matter if a few flabby Hindus had preceded\nhim there, and a few chilly English succeeded?\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " III\n\n\nThe third act of _Cousin Kate_ was well advanced by the time Mrs.\nMoore re-entered the club. Windows were barred, lest the servants\nshould see their mem-sahibs acting, and the heat was consequently\nimmense. One electric fan revolved like a wounded bird, another\nwas out of order. Disinclined to return to the audience, she went\ninto the billiard room, where she was greeted by \"I want to see\nthe _real_ India,\" and her appropriate life came back with a rush.\nThis was Adela Quested, the queer, cautious girl whom Ronny had\ncommissioned her to bring from England, and Ronny was her son, also\ncautious, whom Miss Quested would probably though not certainly\nmarry, and she herself was an elderly lady.\n\n\"I want to see it too, and I only wish we could. Apparently the\nTurtons will arrange something for next Tuesday.\"\n\n\"It'll end in an elephant ride, it always does. Look at this\nevening. _Cousin Kate!_ Imagine, _Cousin Kate!_ But where have you\nbeen off to? Did you succeed in catching the moon in the Ganges?\"\n\nThe two ladies had happened, the night before, to see the moon's\nreflection in a distant channel of the stream. The water had drawn\nit out, so that it had seemed larger than the real moon, and\nbrighter, which had pleased them.\n\n\"I went to the mosque, but I did not catch the moon.\"\n\n\"The angle would have altered   she rises later.\"\n\n\"Later and later,\" yawned Mrs. Moore, who was tired after her walk.\n\"Let me think   we don't see the other side of the moon out here,\nno.\"\n\n\"Come, India's not as bad as all that,\" said a pleasant voice.\n\"Other side of the earth, if you like, but we stick to the same\nold moon.\" Neither of them knew the speaker nor did they ever see\nhim again. He passed with his friendly word through red-brick\npillars into the darkness.\n\n\"We aren't even seeing the other side of the world; that's our\ncomplaint,\" said Adela. Mrs. Moore agreed; she too was disappointed\nat the dullness of their new life. They had made such a romantic\nvoyage across the Mediterranean and through the sands of Egypt to\nthe harbour of Bombay, to find only a gridiron of bungalows at the\nend of it. But she did not take the disappointment as seriously as\nMiss Quested, for the reason that she was forty years older, and\nhad learnt that Life never gives us what we want at the moment that\nwe consider appropriate. Adventures do occur, but not punctually.\nShe said again that she hoped that something interesting would be\narranged for next Tuesday.\n\n\"Have a drink,\" said another pleasant voice. \"Mrs. Moore   Miss\nQuested   have a drink, have two drinks.\" They knew who it was this\ntime   the Collector, Mr. Turton, with whom they had dined. Like\nthemselves, he had found the atmosphere of _Cousin Kate_ too hot.\nRonny, he told them, was stage-managing in place of Major Callendar,\nwhom some native subordinate or other had let down, and doing it\nvery well; then he turned to Ronny's other merits, and in quiet,\ndecisive tones said much that was flattering. It wasn't that the\nyoung man was particularly good at the games or the lingo, or that\nhe had much notion of the Law, but   apparently a large but   Ronny\nwas dignified.\n\nMrs. Moore was surprised to learn this, dignity not being a quality\nwith which any mother credits her son. Miss Quested learnt it with\nanxiety, for she had not decided whether she liked dignified men.\nShe tried indeed to discuss this point with Mr. Turton, but he\nsilenced her with a good-humoured motion of his hand, and continued\nwhat he had come to say. \"The long and the short of it is Heaslop's\na sahib; he's the type we want, he's one of us,\" and another\ncivilian who was leaning over the billiard table said, \"Hear,\nhear!\" The matter was thus placed beyond doubt, and the Collector\npassed on, for other duties called him.\n\nMeanwhile the performance ended, and the amateur orchestra played\nthe National Anthem. Conversation and billiards stopped, faces\nstiffened. It was the Anthem of the Army of Occupation. It reminded\nevery member of the club that he or she was British and in exile.\nIt produced a little sentiment and a useful accession of will-power.\nThe meagre tune, the curt series of demands on Jehovah, fused into\na prayer unknown in England, and though they perceived neither\nRoyalty nor Deity they did perceive something, they were strengthened\nto resist another day. Then they poured out, offering one another\ndrinks.\n\n\"Adela, have a drink; mother, a drink.\"\n\nThey refused   they were weary of drinks   and Miss Quested, who always\nsaid exactly what was in her mind, announced anew that she was\ndesirous of seeing the real India.\n\nRonny was in high spirits. The request struck him as comic, and he\ncalled out to another passer-by: \"Fielding! how's one to see the\nreal India?\"\n\n\"Try seeing Indians,\" the man answered, and vanished.\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\n\"Our schoolmaster   Government College.\"\n\n\"As if one could avoid seeing them,\" sighed Mrs. Lesley.\n\n\"I've avoided,\" said Miss Quested. \"Excepting my own servant, I've\nscarcely spoken to an Indian since landing.\"\n\n\"Oh, lucky you.\"\n\n\"But I want to see them.\"\n\nShe became the centre of an amused group of ladies. One said,\n\"Wanting to see Indians! How new that sounds!\" Another, \"Natives!\nwhy, fancy!\" A third, more serious, said, \"Let me explain. Natives\ndon't respect one any the more after meeting one, you see.\"\n\n\"That occurs after so many meetings.\"\n\nBut the lady, entirely stupid and friendly, continued: \"What I mean\nis, I was a nurse before my marriage, and came across them a great\ndeal, so I know. I really do know the truth about Indians. A most\nunsuitable position for any Englishwoman   I was a nurse in a Native\nState. One's only hope was to hold sternly aloof.\"\n\n\"Even from one's patients?\"\n\n\"Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die,\"\nsaid Mrs. Callendar.\n\n\"How if he went to heaven?\" asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but\ncrooked smile.\n\n\"He can go where he likes as long as he doesn't come near me. They\ngive me the creeps.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact I have thought what you were saying about\nheaven, and that is why I am against Missionaries,\" said the lady\nwho had been a nurse. \"I am all for Chaplains, but all against\nMissionaries. Let me explain.\"\n\nBut before she could do so, the Collector intervened.\n\n\"Do you really want to meet the Aryan Brother, Miss Quested? That\ncan be easily fixed up. I didn't realize he'd amuse you.\" He\nthought a moment. \"You can practically see any type you like. Take\nyour choice. I know the Government people and the landowners,\nHeaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew, while if you want\nto specialize on education, we can come down on Fielding.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a\nfrieze,\" the girl explained. \"It was wonderful when we landed, but\nthat superficial glamour soon goes.\"\n\nHer impressions were of no interest to the Collector; he was only\nconcerned to give her a good time. Would she like a Bridge Party?\nHe explained to her what that was   not the game, but a party to\nbridge the gulf between East and West; the expression was his own\ninvention, and amused all who heard it.\n\n\"I only want those Indians whom you come across socially   as your\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't come across them socially,\" he said, laughing.\n\"They're full of all the virtues, but we don't, and it's now\neleven-thirty, and too late to go into the reasons.\"\n\n\"Miss Quested, what a name!\" remarked Mrs. Turton to her husband\nas they drove away. She had not taken to the new young lady,\nthinking her ungracious and cranky. She trusted that she hadn't\nbeen brought out to marry nice little Heaslop, though it looked\nlike it, Her husband agreed with her in his heart, but he never\nspoke against an Englishwoman if he could avoid doing so, and he\nonly said that Miss Quested naturally made mistakes. He added:\n\"India does wonders for the judgment, especially during the hot\nweather; it has even done wonders for Fielding.\" Mrs. Turton closed\nher eyes at this name and remarked that Mr. Fielding wasn't pukka,\nand had better marry Miss Quested, for she wasn't pukka. Then they\nreached their bungalow, low and enormous, the oldest and most\nuncomfortable bungalow in the civil station, with a sunk soup plate\nof a lawn, and they had one drink more, this time of barley water,\nand went to bed. Their withdrawal from the club had broken up the\nevening, which, like all gatherings, had an official tinge. A\ncommunity that bows the knee to a Viceroy and believes that the\ndivinity that hedges a king can be transplanted, must feel some\nreverence for any viceregal substitute. At Chandrapore the Turtons\nwere little gods; soon they would retire to some suburban villa,\nand die exiled from glory.\n\n\"It's decent of the Burra Sahib,\" chattered Ronny, much gratified\nat the civility that had been shown to his guests. \"Do you know\nhe's never given a Bridge Party before? Coming on top of the dinner\ntoo! I wish I could have arranged something myself, but when you\nknow the natives better you'll realize it's easier for the Burra\nSahib than for me. They know him   they know he can't be fooled   I'm\nstill fresh comparatively. No one can even begin to think of\nknowing this country until he has been in it twenty years.   Hullo,\nthe mater! Here's your cloak.   Well: for an example of the mistakes\none makes. Soon after I came out I asked one of the Pleaders to\nhave a smoke with me   only a cigarette, mind. I found afterwards\nthat he had sent touts all over the bazaar to announce the fact   told\nall the litigants, 'Oh, you'd better come to my Vakil Mahmoud\nAli   he's in with the City Magistrate.' Ever since then I've dropped\non him in Court as hard as I could. It's taught me a lesson, and\nI hope him.\"\n\n\"Isn't the lesson that you should invite all the Pleaders to have\na smoke with you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, but time's limited and the flesh weak. I prefer my smoke\nat the club amongst my own sort, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Why not ask the Pleaders to the club?\" Miss Quested persisted.\n\n\"Not allowed.\" He was pleasant and patient, and evidently understood\nwhy she did not understand. He implied that he had once been as\nshe, though not for long. Going to the verandah, he called firmly\nto the moon. His sais answered, and without lowering his head, he\nordered his trap to be brought round.\n\nMrs. Moore, whom the club had stupefied, woke up outside. She\nwatched the moon, whose radiance stained with primrose the purple\nof the surrounding sky. In England the moon had seemed dead and\nalien; here she was caught in the shawl of night together with\nearth and all the other stars. A sudden sense of unity, of kinship\nwith the heavenly bodies, passed into the old woman and out, like\nwater through a tank, leaving a strange freshness behind. She did\nnot dislike _Cousin Kate_ or the National Anthem, but their note\nhad died into a new one, just as cocktails and cigars had died into\ninvisible flowers. When the mosque, long and domeless, gleamed at\nthe turn of the road, she exclaimed, \"Oh, yes   that's where I got\nto   that's where I've been.\"\n\n\"Been there when?\" asked her son.\n\n\"Between the acts.\"\n\n\"But, mother, you can't do that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Can't mother?\" she replied.\n\n\"No, really not in this country. It's not done. There's the danger\nfrom snakes for one thing. They are apt to lie out in the evening.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, so the young man there said.\"\n\n\"This sounds very romantic,\" said Miss Quested, who was exceedingly\nfond of Mrs. Moore, and was glad she should have had this little\nescapade. \"You meet a young man in a mosque, and then never let me\nknow!\"\n\n\"I was going to tell you, Adela, but something changed the\nconversation and I forgot. My memory grows deplorable.\"\n\n\"Was he nice?\"\n\nShe paused, then said emphatically: \"Very nice.\"\n\n\"Who was he?\" Ronny enquired.\n\n\"A doctor. I don't know his name.\"\n\n\"A doctor? I know of no young doctor in Chandrapore. How odd! What\nwas he like?\"\n\n\"Rather small, with a little moustache and quick eyes. He called\nout to me when I was in the dark part of the mosque   about my shoes.\nThat was how we began talking. He was afraid I had them on, but I\nremembered luckily. He told me about his children, and then we\nwalked back to the club. He knows you well.\"\n\n\"I wish you had pointed him out to me. I can't make out who he is.\"\n\n\"He didn't come into the club. He said he wasn't allowed to.\"\n\nThereupon the truth struck him, and he cried \"Oh, good gracious!\nNot a Mohammedan? Why ever didn't you tell me you'd been talking\nto a native? I was going all wrong.\"\n\n\"A Mohammedan! How perfectly magnificent!\" exclaimed Miss Quested.\n\"Ronny, isn't that like your mother? While we talk about seeing\nthe real India, she goes and sees it, and then forgets she's seen\nit.\"\n\nBut Ronny was ruffled. From his mother's description he had thought\nthe doctor might be young Muggins from over the Ganges, and had\nbrought out all the comradely emotions. What a mix-up! Why hadn't\nshe indicated by the tone of her voice that she was talking about\nan Indian? Scratchy and dictatorial, he began to question her. \"He\ncalled to you in the mosque, did he? How? Impudently? What was he\ndoing there himself at that time of night?   No, it's not their\nprayer time.\"   This in answer to a suggestion of Miss Quested's,\nwho showed the keenest interest. \"So he called to you over your\nshoes. Then it was impudence. It's an old trick. I wish you had\nhad them on.\"\n\n\"I think it was impudence, but I don't know about a trick,\" said\nMrs. Moore. \"His nerves were all on edge   I could tell from his\nvoice. As soon as I answered he altered.\"\n\n\"You oughtn't to have answered.\"\n\n\"Now look here,\" said the logical girl, \"wouldn't you expect a\nMohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in\nchurch?\"\n\n\"It's different, it's different; you don't understand.\"\n\n\"I know I don't, and I want to. What is the difference, please?\"\n\nHe wished she wouldn't interfere. His mother did not signify   she\nwas just a globe-trotter, a temporary escort, who could retire to\nEngland with what impressions she chose. But Adela, who meditated\nspending her life in the country, was a more serious matter; it\nwould be tiresome if she started crooked over the native question.\nPulling up the mare, he said, \"There's your Ganges.\"\n\nTheir attention was diverted. Below them a radiance had suddenly\nappeared. It belonged neither to water nor moonlight, but stood\nlike a luminous sheaf upon the fields of darkness. He told them\nthat it was where the new sand-bank was forming, and that the dark\nravelled bit at the top was the sand, and that the dead bodies\nfloated down that way from Benares, or would if the crocodiles let\nthem. \"It's not much of a dead body that gets down to Chandrapore.\"\n\n\"Crocodiles down in it too, how terrible!\" his mother murmured.\nThe young people glanced at each other and smiled; it amused them\nwhen the old lady got these gentle creeps, and harmony was restored\nbetween them consequently. She continued: \"What a terrible river!\nwhat a wonderful river!\" and sighed. The radiance was already\naltering, whether through shifting of the moon or of the sand; soon\nthe bright sheaf would be gone, and a circlet, itself to alter, be\nburnished upon the streaming void. The women discussed whether they\nwould wait for the change or not, while the silence broke into\npatches of unquietness and the mare shivered. On her account they\ndid not wait, but drove on to the City Magistrate's bungalow, where\nMiss Quested went to bed, and Mrs. Moore had a short interview with\nher son.\n\nHe wanted to enquire about the Mohammedan doctor in the mosque. It\nwas his duty to report suspicious characters and conceivably it\nwas some disreputable hakim who had prowled up from the bazaar.\nWhen she told him that it was someone connected with the Minto\nHospital, he was relieved, and said that the fellow's name must be\nAziz, and that he was quite all right, nothing against him at all.\n\n\"Aziz! what a charming name!\"\n\n\"So you and he had a talk. Did you gather he was well disposed?\"\n\nIgnorant of the force of this question, she replied, \"Yes, quite,\nafter the first moment.\"\n\n\"I meant, generally. Did he seem to tolerate us   the brutal\nconqueror, the sundried bureaucrat, that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I think so, except the Callendars   he doesn't care for\nthe Callendars at all.\"\n\n\"Oh. So he told you that, did he? The Major will be interested. I\nwonder what was the aim of the remark.\"\n\n\"Ronny, Ronny! you're never going to pass it on to Major Callendar?\"\n\n\"Yes, rather. I must, in fact!\"\n\n\"But, my dear boy      \"\n\n\"If the Major heard I was disliked by any native subordinate of\nmine, I should expect him to pass it on to me.\"\n\n\"But, my dear boy   a private conversation!\"\n\n\"Nothing's private in India. Aziz knew that when he spoke out, so\ndon't you worry. He had some motive in what he said. My personal\nbelief is that the remark wasn't true.\"\n\n\"How not true?\"\n\n\"He abused the Major in order to impress you.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, dear.\"\n\n\"It's the educated native's latest dodge. They used to cringe, but\nthe younger generation believe in a show of manly independence.\nThey think it will pay better with the itinerant M.P. But whether\nthe native swaggers or cringes, there's always something behind\nevery remark he makes, always something, and if nothing else he's\ntrying to increase his izzat   in plain Anglo-Saxon, to score. Of\ncourse there are exceptions.\"\n\n\"You never used to judge people like this at home.\"\n\n\"India isn't home,\" he retorted, rather rudely, but in order to\nsilence her he had been using phrases and arguments that he had\npicked up from older officials, and he did not feel quite sure of\nhimself. When he said \"of course there are exceptions\" he was\nquoting Mr. Turton, while \"increasing the izzat\" was Major\nCallendar's own. The phrases worked and were in current use at the\nclub, but she was rather clever at detecting the first from the\nsecond hand, and might press him for definite examples.\n\nShe only said, \"I can't deny that what you say sounds very sensible,\nbut you really must not hand on to Major Callendar anything I have\ntold you about Doctor Aziz.\"\n\nHe felt disloyal to his caste, but he promised, adding, \"In return\nplease don't talk about Aziz to Adela.\"\n\n\"Not talk about him? Why?\"\n\n\"There you go again, mother   I really can't explain every thing. I\ndon't want Adela to be worried, that's the fact; she'll begin\nwondering whether we treat the natives properly, and all that sort\nof nonsense.\"\n\n\"But she came out to be worried   that's exactly why she's here. She\ndiscussed it all on the boat. We had a long talk when we went on\nshore at Aden. She knows you in play, as she put it, but not in\nwork, and she felt she must come and look round, before she\ndecided   and before you decided. She is very, very fair-minded.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said dejectedly.\n\nThe note of anxiety in his voice made her feel that he was still\na little boy, who must have what he liked, so she promised to do\nas he wished, and they kissed good night. He had not forbidden her\nto think about Aziz, however, and she did this when she retired to\nher room. In the light of her son's comment she reconsidered the\nscene at the mosque, to see whose impression was correct. Yes, it\ncould be worked into quite an unpleasant scene. The doctor had\nbegun by bullying her, had said Mrs. Callendar was nice, and\nthen   finding the ground safe   had changed; he had alternately whined\nover his grievances and patronized her, had run a dozen ways in a\nsingle sentence, had been unreliable, inquisitive, vain. Yes, it\nwas all true, but how false as a summary of the man; the essential\nlife of him had been slain.\n\nGoing to hang up her cloak, she found that the tip of the peg was\noccupied by a small wasp. She had known this wasp or his relatives\nby day; they were not as English wasps, but had long yellow legs\nwhich hung down behind when they flew. Perhaps he mistook the peg\nfor a branch   no Indian animal has any sense of an interior. Bats,\nrats, birds, insects will as soon nest inside a house as out; it\nis to them a normal growth of the eternal jungle, which alternately\nproduces houses trees, houses trees. There he clung, asleep, while\njackals in the plain bayed their desires and mingled with the\npercussion of drums.\n\n\"Pretty dear,\" said Mrs. Moore to the wasp. He did not wake, but\nher voice floated out, to swell the night's uneasiness.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " IV\n\n\nThe Collector kept his word. Next day he issued invitation cards\nto numerous Indian gentlemen in the neighbourhood, stating that he\nwould be at home in the garden of the club between the hours of\nfive and seven on the following Tuesday, also that Mrs. Turton\nwould be glad to receive any ladies of their families who were out\nof purdah. His action caused much excitement and was discussed in\nseveral worlds.\n\n\"It is owing to orders from the L.G.,\" was Mahmoud Ali's explanation.\n\"Turton would never do this unless compelled. Those high officials\nare different   they sympathize, the Viceroy sympathizes, they would\nhave us treated properly. But they come too seldom and live too\nfar away. Meanwhile      \"\n\n\"It is easy to sympathize at a distance,\" said an old gentleman\nwith a beard. \"I value more the kind word that is spoken close to\nmy ear. Mr. Turton has spoken it, from whatever cause. He speaks,\nwe hear. I do not see why we need discuss it further.\" Quotations\nfollowed from the Koran.\n\n\"We have not all your sweet nature, Nawab Bahadur, nor your\nlearning.\"\n\n\"The Lieutenant-Governor may be my very good friend, but I give\nhim no trouble.   How do you do, Nawab Bahadur?   Quite well, thank\nyou, Sir Gilbert; how are you?   And all is over. But I can be a\nthorn in Mr. Turton's flesh, and if he asks me I accept the\ninvitation. I shall come in from Dilkusha specially, though I have\nto postpone other business.\"\n\n\"You will make yourself chip,\" suddenly said a little black man.\n\nThere was a stir of disapproval. Who was this ill-bred upstart,\nthat he should criticize the leading Mohammedan landowner of the\ndistrict? Mahmoud Ali, though sharing his opinion, felt bound to\noppose it. \"Mr. Ram Chand!\" he said, swaying forward stiffly with\nhis hands on his hips.\n\n\"Mr. Mahmoud Ali!\"\n\n\"Mr. Ram Chand, the Nawab Bahadur can decide what is cheap without\nour valuation, I think.\"\n\n\"I do not expect I shall make myself cheap,\" said the Nawab Bahadur\nto Mr. Ram Chand, speaking very pleasantly, for he was aware that\nthe man had been impolite and he desired to shield him from the\nconsequences. It had passed through his mind to reply, \"I expect\nI shall make myself cheap,\" but he rejected this as the less\ncourteous alternative. \"I do not see why we should make ourselves\ncheap. I do not see why we should. The invitation is worded very\ngraciously.\" Feeling that he could not further decrease the social\ngulf between himself and his auditors, he sent his elegant grandson,\nwho was in attendance on him, to fetch his car. When it came, he\nrepeated all that he had said before, though at greater length,\nending up with \"Till Tuesday, then, gentlemen all, when I hope we\nmay meet in the flower gardens of the club.\"\n\nThis opinion carried great weight. The Nawab Bahadur was a big\nproprietor and a philanthropist, a man of benevolence and decision.\nHis character among all the communities in the province stood high.\nHe was a straightforward enemy and a staunch friend, and his\nhospitality was proverbial. \"Give, do not lend; after death who\nwill thank you?\" was his favourite remark. He held it a disgrace\nto die rich. When such a man was prepared to motor twenty-five\nmiles to shake the Collector's hand, the entertainment took another\naspect. For he was not like some eminent men, who give out that\nthey will come, and then fail at the last moment, leaving the small\nfry floundering. If he said he would come, he would come, he would\nnever deceive his supporters. The gentlemen whom he had lectured\nnow urged one another to attend the party, although convinced at\nheart that his advice was unsound.\n\nHe had spoken in the little room near the Courts where the pleaders\nwaited for clients; clients, waiting for pleaders, sat in the dust\noutside. These had not received a card from Mr. Turton. And there\nwere circles even beyond these   people who wore nothing but a\nloincloth, people who wore not even that, and spent their lives in\nknocking two sticks together before a scarlet doll   humanity grading\nand drifting beyond the educated vision, until no earthly invitation\ncan embrace it.\n\nAll invitations must proceed from heaven perhaps; perhaps it is\nfutile for men to initiate their own unity, they do but widen the\ngulfs between them by the attempt. So at all events thought old\nMr. Graysford and young Mr. Sorley, the devoted missionaries who\nlived out beyond the slaughterhouses, always travelled third on\nthe railways, and never came up to the club. In our Father's house\nare many mansions, they taught, and there alone will the incompatible\nmultitudes of mankind be welcomed and soothed. Not one shall be\nturned away by the servants on that verandah, be he black or white,\nnot one shall be kept standing who approaches with a loving heart.\nAnd why should the divine hospitality cease here? Consider, with\nall reverence, the monkeys. May there not be a mansion for the\nmonkeys also? Old Mr. Graysford said No, but young Mr. Sorley, who\nwas advanced, said Yes; he saw no reason why monkeys should not\nhave their collateral share of bliss, and he had sympathetic\ndiscussions about them with his Hindu friends. And the jackals?\nJackals were indeed less to Mr. Sorley's mind, but he admitted that\nthe mercy of God, being infinite, may well embrace all mammals.\nAnd the wasps? He became uneasy during the descent to wasps, and\nwas apt to change the conversation. And oranges, cactuses, crystals\nand mud? and the bacteria inside Mr. Sorley? No, no, this is going\ntoo far. We must exclude someone from our gathering, or we shall\nbe left with nothing.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " V\n\n\nThe Bridge Party was not a success   at least it was not what Mrs.\nMoore and Miss Quested were accustomed to consider a successful\nparty. They arrived early, since it was given in their honour, but\nmost of the Indian guests had arrived even earlier, and stood\nmassed at the farther side of the tennis lawns, doing nothing.\n\n\"It is only just five,\" said Mrs. Turton. \"My husband will be up\nfrom his office in a moment and start the thing. I have no idea\nwhat we have to do. It's the first time we've ever given a party\nlike this at the club. Mr. Heaslop, when I'm dead and gone will\nyou give parties like this? It's enough to make the old type of\nBurra Sahib turn in his grave.\"\n\nRonny laughed deferentially. \"You wanted something not picturesque\nand we've provided it,\" he remarked to Miss Quested. \"What do you\nthink of the Aryan Brother in a topi and spats?\"\n\nNeither she nor his mother answered. They were gazing rather sadly\nover the tennis lawn. No, it was not picturesque; the East,\nabandoning its secular magnificence, was descending into a valley\nwhose farther side no man can see.\n\n\"The great point to remember is that no one who's here matters;\nthose who matter don't come. Isn't that so, Mrs. Turton?\"\n\n\"Absolutely true,\" said the great lady, leaning back. She was\n\"saving herself up,\" as she called it   not for anything that would\nhappen that afternoon or even that week, but for some vague future\noccasion when a high official might come along and tax her social\nstrength. Most of her public appearances were marked by this air\nof reserve.\n\nAssured of her approbation, Ronny continued: \"The educated Indians\nwill be no good to us if there's a row, it's simply not worth while\nconciliating them, that's why they don't matter. Most of the people\nyou see are seditious at heart, and the rest 'ld run squealing.\nThe cultivator   he's another story. The Pathan   he's a man if you\nlike. But these people   don't imagine they're India.\" He pointed to\nthe dusky line beyond the court, and here and there it flashed a\npince-nez or shuffled a shoe, as if aware that he was despising\nit. European costume had lighted like a leprosy. Few had yielded\nentirely, but none were untouched. There was a silence when he had\nfinished speaking, on both sides of the court; at least, more\nladies joined the English group, but their words seemed to die as\nsoon as uttered. Some kites hovered overhead, impartial, over the\nkites passed the mass of a vulture, and with an impartiality\nexceeding all, the sky, not deeply coloured but translucent, poured\nlight from its whole circumference. It seemed unlikely that the\nseries stopped here. Beyond the sky must not there be something\nthat overarches all the skies, more impartial even than they?\nBeyond which again . . .\n\nThey spoke of _Cousin Kate._\n\nThey had tried to reproduce their own attitude to life upon the\nstage, and to dress up as the middle-class English people they\nactually were. Next year they would do _Quality Street_ or _The\nYeomen of the Guard._ Save for this annual incursion, they left\nliterature alone. The men had no time for it, the women did nothing\nthat they could not share with the men. Their ignorance of the Arts\nwas notable, and they lost no opportunity of proclaiming it to one\nanother; it was the Public School attitude, flourishing more\nvigorously than it can yet hope to do in England. If Indians were\nshop, the Arts were bad form, and Ronny had repressed his mother\nwhen she enquired after his viola; a viola was almost a demerit,\nand certainly not the sort of instrument one mentioned in public.\nShe noticed now how tolerant and conventional his judgments had\nbecome; when they had seen _Cousin Kate_ in London together in the\npast, he had scorned it; now he pretended that it was a good play,\nin order to hurt nobody's feelings. An \"unkind notice\" had appeared\nin the local paper, \"the sort of thing no white man could have\nwritten,\" as Mrs. Lesley said. The play was praised, to be sure,\nand so were the stage management and the performance as a whole,\nbut the notice contained the following sentence: \"Miss Derek,\nthough she charmingly looked her part, lacked the necessary\nexperience, and occasionally forgot her words.\" This tiny breath\nof genuine criticism had given deep offence, not indeed to Miss\nDerek, who was as hard as nails, but to her friends. Miss Derek\ndid not belong to Chandrapore. She was stopping for a fortnight\nwith the McBrydes, the police people, and she had been so good as\nto fill up a gap in the cast at the last moment. A nice impression\nof local hospitality she would carry away with her.\n\n\"To work, Mary, to work,\" cried the Collector, touching his wife\non the shoulder with a switch.\n\nMrs. Turton got up awkwardly. \"What do you want me to do? Oh, those\npurdah women! I never thought any would come. Oh dear!\"\n\nA little group of Indian ladies had been gathering in a third\nquarter of the grounds, near a rustic summer-house in which the\nmore timid of them had already taken refuge. The rest stood with\ntheir backs to the company and their faces pressed into a bank of\nshrubs. At a little distance stood their male relatives, watching\nthe venture. The sight was significant: an island bared by the\nturning tide, and bound to grow.\n\n\"I consider they ought to come over to me.\"\n\n\"Come along, Mary, get it over.\"\n\n\"I refuse to shake hands with any of the men, unless it has to be\nthe Nawab Bahadur.\"\n\n\"Whom have we so far?\" He glanced along the line. \"H'm! h'm! much\nas one expected. We know why he's here, I think   over that contract,\nand he wants to get the right side of me for Mohurram, and he's\nthe astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations,\nand he's that Parsi, and he's   Hullo! there he goes   smash into our\nhollyhocks. Pulled the left rein when he meant the right. All as\nusual.\"\n\n\"They ought never to have been allowed to drive in; it's so bad\nfor them,\" said Mrs. Turton, who had at last begun her progress to\nthe summer-house, accompanied by Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested, and a\nterrier. \"Why they come at all I don't know. They hate it as much\nas we do. Talk to Mrs. McBryde. Her husband made her give purdah\nparties until she struck.\"\n\n\"This isn't a purdah party,\" corrected Miss Quested.\n\n\"Oh, really,\" was the haughty rejoinder.\n\n\"Do kindly tell us who these ladies are,\" asked Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"You're superior to them, anyway. Don't forget that. You're superior\nto everyone in India except one or two of the Ranis, and they're\non an equality.\"\n\nAdvancing, she shook hands with the group and said a few words of\nwelcome in Urdu. She had learnt the lingo, but only to speak to\nher servants, so she knew none of the politer forms and of the\nverbs only the imperative mood. As soon as her speech was over,\nshe enquired of her companions, \"Is that what you wanted?\"\n\n\"Please tell these ladies that I wish we could speak their language,\nbut we have only just come to their country.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we speak yours a little,\" one of the ladies said.\n\n\"Why, fancy, she understands!\" said Mrs. Turton.\n\n\"Eastbourne, Piccadilly, High Park Corner,\" said another of the\nladies.\n\n\"Oh yes, they're English-speaking.\"\n\n\"But now we can talk: how delightful!\" cried Adela, her face\nlighting up.\n\n\"She knows Paris also,\" called one of the onlookers.\n\n\"They pass Paris on the way, no doubt,\" said Mrs. Turton, as if\nshe was describing the movements of migratory birds. Her manner\nhad grown more distant since she had discovered that some of the\ngroup was Westernized, and might apply her own standards to her.\n\n\"The shorter lady, she is my wife, she is Mrs. Bhattacharya,\" the\nonlooker explained. \"The taller lady, she is my sister, she is Mrs.\nDas.\"\n\nThe shorter and the taller ladies both adjusted their saris, and\nsmiled. There was a curious uncertainty about their gestures, as\nif they sought for a new formula which neither East nor West could\nprovide. When Mrs. Bhattacharya's husband spoke, she turned away\nfrom him, but she did not mind seeing the other men. Indeed all\nthe ladies were uncertain, cowering, recovering, giggling, making\ntiny gestures of atonement or despair at all that was said, and\nalternately fondling the terrier or shrinking from him. Miss\nQuested now had her desired opportunity; friendly Indians were\nbefore her, and she tried to make them talk, but she failed, she\nstrove in vain against the echoing walls of their civility. Whatever\nshe said produced a murmur of deprecation, varying into a murmur\nof concern when she dropped her pocket-handkerchief. She tried\ndoing nothing, to see what that produced, and they too did nothing.\nMrs. Moore was equally unsuccessful. Mrs. Turton waited for them\nwith a detached expression; she had known what nonsense it all was\nfrom the first.\n\nWhen they took their leave, Mrs. Moore had an impulse, and said to\nMrs. Bhattacharya, whose face she liked, \"I wonder whether you\nwould allow us to call on you some day.\"\n\n\"When?\" she replied, inclining charmingly.\n\n\"Whenever is convenient.\"\n\n\"All days are convenient.\"\n\n\"Thursday . . .\"\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n\"We shall enjoy it greatly, it would be a real pleasure. What about\nthe time?\"\n\n\"All hours.\"\n\n\"Tell us which you would prefer. We're quite strangers to your\ncountry; we don't know when you have visitors,\" said Miss Quested.\n\nMrs. Bhattacharya seemed not to know either. Her gesture implied\nthat she had known, since Thursdays began, that English ladies\nwould come to see her on one of them, and so always stayed in.\nEverything pleased her, nothing surprised. She added, \"We leave\nfor Calcutta to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you?\" said Adela, not at first seeing the implication. Then\nshe cried, \"Oh, but if you do we shall find you gone.\"\n\nMrs. Bhattacharya did not dispute it. But her husband called from\nthe distance, \"Yes, yes, you come to us Thursday.\"\n\n\"But you'll be in Calcutta.\"\n\n\"No, no, we shall not.\" He said something swiftly to his wife in\nBengali. \"We expect you Thursday.\"\n\n\"Thursday . . .\" the woman echoed.\n\n\"You can't have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for\nour sake?\" exclaimed Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"No, of course not, we are not such people.\" He was laughing.\n\n\"I believe that you have. Oh, please   it distresses me beyond\nwords.\"\n\nEveryone was laughing now, but with no suggestion that they had\nblundered. A shapeless discussion occurred, during which Mrs.\nTurton retired, smiling to herself. The upshot was that they were\nto come Thursday, but early in the morning, so as to wreck the\nBhattacharya plans as little as possible, and Mr. Bhattacharya\nwould send his carriage to fetch them, with servants to point out\nthe way. Did he know where they lived? Yes, of course he knew, he\nknew everything; and he laughed again. They left among a flutter\nof compliments and smiles, and three ladies, who had hitherto taken\nno part in the reception, suddenly shot out of the summer-house\nlike exquisitely coloured swallows, and salaamed them.\n\nMeanwhile the Collector had been going his rounds. He made pleasant\nremarks and a few jokes, which were applauded lustily, but he knew\nsomething to the discredit of nearly every one of his guests, and\nwas consequently perfunctory. When they had not cheated, it was\nbhang, women, or worse, and even the desirables wanted to get\nsomething out of him. He believed that a \"Bridge Party\" did good\nrather than harm, or he would not have given one, but he was under\nno illusions, and at the proper moment he retired to the English\nside of the lawn. The impressions he left behind him were various.\nMany of the guests, especially the humbler and less anglicized,\nwere genuinely grateful. To be addressed by so high an official\nwas a permanent asset. They did not mind how long they stood, or\nhow little happened, and when seven o'clock struck, they had to be\nturned out. Others were grateful with more intelligence. The Nawab\nBahadur, indifferent for himself and for the distinction with which\nhe was greeted, was moved by the mere kindness that must have\nprompted the invitation. He knew the difficulties. Hamidullah also\nthought that the Collector had played up well. But others, such as\nMahmoud Ali, were cynical; they were firmly convinced that Turton\nhad been made to give the party by his official superiors and was\nall the time consumed with impotent rage, and they infected some\nwho were inclined to a healthier view. Yet even Mahmoud Ali was\nglad he had come. Shrines are fascinating, especially when rarely\nopened, and it amused him to note the ritual of the English club,\nand to caricature it afterwards to his friends.\n\nAfter Mr. Turton, the official who did his duty best was Mr.\nFielding, the Principal of the little Government College. He knew\nlittle of the district and less against the inhabitants, so he was\nin a less cynical state of mind. Athletic and cheerful, he romped\nabout, making numerous mistakes which the parents of his pupils\ntried to cover up, for he was popular among them. When the moment\nfor refreshments came, he did not move back to the English side,\nbut burnt his mouth with gram. He talked to anyone and he ate\nanything. Amid much that was alien, he learnt that the two new\nladies from England had been a great success, and that their\npoliteness in wishing to be Mrs. Bhattacharya's guests had pleased\nnot only her but all Indians who heard of it. It pleased Mr.\nFielding also. He scarcely knew the two new ladies, still he\ndecided to tell them what pleasure they had given by their\nfriendliness.\n\nHe found the younger of them alone. She was looking through a nick\nin the cactus hedge at the distant Marabar Hills, which had crept\nnear, as was their custom at sunset; if the sunset had lasted long\nenough, they would have reached the town, but it was swift, being\ntropical. He gave her his information, and she was so much pleased\nand thanked him so heartily that he asked her and the other lady\nto tea.\n\n\"I'ld like to come very much indeed, and so would Mrs. Moore, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"I'm rather a hermit, you know.\"\n\n\"Much the best thing to be in this place.\"\n\n\"Owing to my work and so on, I don't get up much to the club.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, and we never get down from it. I envy you being\nwith Indians.\"\n\n\"Do you care to meet one or two?\"\n\n\"Very, very much indeed; it's what I long for. This party to-day\nmakes me so angry and miserable. I think my countrymen out here\nmust be mad. Fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly!\nYou and Mr. Turton and perhaps Mr. McBryde are the only people who\nshowed any common politeness. The rest make me perfectly ashamed,\nand it's got worse and worse.\"\n\nIt had. The Englishmen had intended to play up better, but had been\nprevented from doing so by their women folk, whom they had to\nattend, provide with tea, advise about dogs, etc. When tennis\nbegan, the barrier grew impenetrable. It had been hoped to have\nsome sets between East and West, but this was forgotten, and the\ncourts were monopolized by the usual club couples. Fielding resented\nit too, but did not say so to the girl, for he found something\ntheoretical in her outburst. Did she care about Indian music? he\nenquired; there was an old professor down at the College, who sang.\n\n\"Oh, just what we wanted to hear. And do you know Doctor Aziz?\"\n\n\"I know all about him. I don't know him. Would you like him asked\ntoo?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Moore says he is so nice.\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss Quested. Will Thursday suit you?\"\n\n\"Indeed it will, and that morning we go to this Indian lady's. All\nthe nice things are coming Thursday.\"\n\n\"I won't ask the City Magistrate to bring you. I know he'll be busy\nat that time.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ronny is always hard-worked,\" she replied, contemplating the\nhills. How lovely they suddenly were! But she couldn't touch them.\nIn front, like a shutter, fell a vision of her married life. She\nand Ronny would look into the club like this every evening, then\ndrive home to dress; they would see the Lesleys and the Callendars\nand the Turtons and the Burtons, and invite them and be invited by\nthem, while the true India slid by unnoticed. Colour would\nremain   the pageant of birds in the early morning, brown bodies,\nwhite turbans, idols whose flesh was scarlet or blue   and movement\nwould remain as long as there were crowds in the bazaar and bathers\nin the tanks. Perched up on the seat of a dogcart, she would see\nthem. But the force that lies behind colour and movement would\nescape her even more effectually than it did now. She would see\nIndia always as a frieze, never as a spirit, and she assumed that\nit was a spirit of which Mrs. Moore had had a glimpse.\n\nAnd sure enough they did drive away from the club in a few minutes,\nand they did dress, and to dinner came Miss Derek and the McBrydes,\nand the menu was: Julienne soup full of bullety bottled peas,\npseudo-cottage bread, fish full of branching bones, pretending to\nbe plaice, more bottled peas with the cutlets, trifle, sardines on\ntoast: the menu of Anglo-India. A dish might be added or subtracted\nas one rose or fell in the official scale, the peas might rattle\nless or more, the sardines and the vermouth be imported by a\ndifferent firm, but the tradition remained; the food of exiles,\ncooked by servants who did not understand it. Adela thought of the\nyoung men and women who had come out before her, P. & O. full after\nP. & O. full, and had been set down to the same food and the same\nideas, and been snubbed in the same good-humoured way until they\nkept to the accredited themes and began to snub others. \"I should\nnever get like that,\" she thought, for she was young herself; all\nthe same she knew that she had come up against something that was\nboth insidious and tough, and against which she needed allies. She\nmust gather around her at Chandrapore a few people who felt as she\ndid, and she was glad to have met Mr. Fielding and the Indian lady\nwith the unpronounceable name. Here at all events was a nucleus;\nshe should know much better where she stood in the course of the\nnext two days.\n\nMiss Derek   she companioned a Maharani in a remote Native State.\nShe was genial and gay and made them all laugh about her leave,\nwhich she had taken because she felt she deserved it, not because\nthe Maharani said she might go. Now she wanted to take the\nMaharajah's motor-car as well; it had gone to a Chiefs' Conference\nat Delhi, and she had a great scheme for burgling it at the junction\nas it came back in the train. She was also very funny about the\nBridge Party   indeed she regarded the entire peninsula as a comic\nopera. \"If one couldn't see the laughable side of these people one\n'ld be done for,\" said Miss Derek. Mrs. McBryde   it was she who had\nbeen the nurse   ceased not to exclaim, \"Oh, Nancy, how topping! Oh,\nNancy, how killing! I wish I could look at things like that.\" Mr.\nMcBryde did not speak much; he seemed nice.\n\nWhen the guests had gone, and Adela gone to bed, there was another\ninterview between mother and son. He wanted her advice and\nsupport   while resenting interference. \"Does Adela talk to you\nmuch?\" he began. \"I'm so driven with work, I don't see her as much\nas I hoped, but I hope she finds things comfortable.\"\n\n\"Adela and I talk mostly about India. Dear, since you mention it,\nyou're quite right   you ought to be more alone with her than you\nare.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps, but then people'ld gossip.\"\n\n\"Well, they must gossip sometime! Let them gossip.\"\n\n\"People are so odd out here, and it's not like home   one's always\nfacing the footlights, as the Burra Sahib said. Take a silly little\nexample: when Adela went out to the boundary of the club compound,\nand Fielding followed her. I saw Mrs. Callendar notice it. They\nnotice everything, until they're perfectly sure you're their sort.\"\n\n\"I don't think Adela 'll ever be quite their sort   she's much too\nindividual.\"\n\n\"I know, that's so remarkable about her,\" he said thoughtfully.\nMrs. Moore thought him rather absurd. Accustomed to the privacy of\nLondon, she could not realize that India, seemingly so mysterious,\ncontains none, and that consequently the conventions have greater\nforce. \"I suppose nothing's on her mind,\" he continued.\n\n\"Ask her, ask her yourself, my dear boy.\"\n\n\"Probably she's heard tales of the heat, but of course I should\npack her off to the Hills every April   I'm not one to keep a wife\ngrilling in the Plains.\"\n\n\"Oh, it wouldn't be the weather.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in India but the weather, my dear mother; it's\nthe Alpha and Omega of the whole affair.\"\n\n\"Yes, as Mr. McBryde was saying, but it's much more the Anglo-Indians\nthemselves who are likely to get on Adela's nerves. She doesn't\nthink they behave pleasantly to Indians, you see.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" he exclaimed, losing his gentle manner. \"I\nknew it last week. Oh, how like a woman to worry over a side-issue!\"\n\nShe forgot about Adela in her surprise. \"A side-issue, a side-issue?\"\nshe repeated. \"How can it be that?\"\n\n\"We're not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What I say. We're out here to do justice and keep the peace.\nThem's my sentiments. India isn't a drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Your sentiments are those of a god,\" she said quietly, but it was\nhis manner rather than his sentiments that annoyed her.\n\nTrying to recover his temper, he said, \"India likes gods.\"\n\n\"And Englishmen like posing as gods.\"\n\n\"There's no point in all this. Here we are, and we're going to\nstop, and the country's got to put up with us, gods or no gods.\nOh, look here,\" he broke out, rather pathetically, \"what do you\nand Adela want me to do? Go against my class, against all the\npeople I respect and admire out here? Lose such power as I have\nfor doing good in this country because my behaviour isn't pleasant?\nYou neither of you understand what work is, or you 'ld never talk\nsuch eyewash. I hate talking like this, but one must occasionally.\nIt's morbidly sensitive to go on as Adela and you do. I noticed\nyou both at the club to-day   after the Burra Sahib had been at all\nthat trouble to amuse you. I am out here to work, mind, to hold\nthis wretched country by force. I'm not a missionary or a Labour\nMember or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man. I'm just\na servant of the Government; it's the profession you wanted me to\nchoose myself, and that's that. We're not pleasant in India, and\nwe don't intend to be pleasant. We've something more important to\ndo.\"\n\nHe spoke sincerely. Every day he worked hard in the court trying\nto decide which of two untrue accounts was the less untrue, trying\nto dispense justice fearlessly, to protect the weak against the\nless weak, the incoherent against the plausible, surrounded by lies\nand flattery. That morning he had convicted a railway clerk of\novercharging pilgrims for their tickets, and a Pathan of attempted\nrape. He expected no gratitude, no recognition for this, and both\nclerk and Pathan might appeal, bribe their witnesses more\neffectually in the interval, and get their sentences reversed. It\nwas his duty. But he did expect sympathy from his own people, and\nexcept from new-comers he obtained it. He did think he ought not\nto be worried about \"Bridge Parties\" when the day's work was over\nand he wanted to play tennis with his equals or rest his legs upon\na long chair.\n\nHe spoke sincerely, but she could have wished with less gusto. How\nRonny revelled in the drawbacks of his situation! How he did rub\nit in that he was not in India to behave pleasantly, and derived\npositive satisfaction therefrom! He reminded her of his\npublic-schooldays. The traces of young-man humanitarianism had\nsloughed off, and he talked like an intelligent and embittered boy.\nHis words without his voice might have impressed her, but when she\nheard the self-satisfied lilt of them, when she saw the mouth\nmoving so complacently and competently beneath the little red nose,\nshe felt, quite illogically, that this was not the last word on\nIndia. One touch of regret   not the canny substitute but the true\nregret from the heart   would have made him a different man, and the\nBritish Empire a different institution.\n\n\"I'm going to argue, and indeed dictate,\" she said, clinking her\nrings. \"The English are out here to be pleasant.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out, mother?\" he asked, speaking gently\nagain, for he was ashamed of his irritability.\n\n\"Because India is part of the earth. And God has put us on the\nearth in order to be pleasant to each other. God . . . is . . .\nlove.\" She hesitated, seeing how much he disliked the argument,\nbut something made her go on. \"God has put us on earth to love our\nneighbours and to show it, and He is omnipresent, even in India,\nto see how we are succeeding.\"\n\nHe looked gloomy, and a little anxious. He knew this religious\nstrain in her, and that it was a symptom of bad health; there had\nbeen much of it when his stepfather died. He thought, \"She is\ncertainly ageing, and I ought not to be vexed with anything she\nsays.\"\n\n\"The desire to behave pleasantly satisfies God. . . The sincere if\nimpotent desire wins His blessing. I think every one fails, but\nthere are so many kinds of failure. Good will and more good will\nand more good will. Though I speak with the tongues of . . .\"\n\nHe waited until she had done, and then said gently, \"I quite see\nthat. I suppose I ought to get off to my files now, and you'll be\ngoing to bed.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, I suppose so.\" They did not part for a few minutes,\nbut the conversation had become unreal since Christianity had\nentered it. Ronny approved of religion as long as it endorsed the\nNational Anthem, but he objected when it attempted to influence\nhis life. Then he would say in respectful yet decided tones, \"I\ndon't think it does to talk about these things, every fellow has\nto work out his own religion,\" and any fellow who heard him\nmuttered, \"Hear!\"\n\nMrs. Moore felt that she had made a mistake in mentioning God, but\nshe found him increasingly difficult to avoid as she grew older,\nand he had been constantly in her thoughts since she entered India,\nthough oddly enough he satisfied her less. She must needs pronounce\nhis name frequently, as the greatest she knew, yet she had never\nfound it less efficacious. Outside the arch there seemed always an\narch, beyond the remotest echo a silence. And she regretted\nafterwards that she had not kept to the real serious subject that\nhad caused her to visit India   namely the relationship between Ronny\nand Adela. Would they, or would they not, succeed in becoming\nengaged to be married?\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " VI\n\n\nAziz had not gone to the Bridge Party. Immediately after his\nmeeting with Mrs. Moore he was diverted to other matters. Several\nsurgical cases came in, and kept him busy. He ceased to be either\noutcaste or poet, and became the medical student, very gay, and\nfull of details of operations which he poured into the shrinking\nears of his friends. His profession fascinated him at times, but\nhe required it to be exciting, and it was his hand, not his mind,\nthat was scientific. The knife he loved and used skilfully, and he\nalso liked pumping in the latest serums. But the boredom of regime\nand hygiene repelled him, and after inoculating a man for enteric,\nhe would go away and drink unfiltered water himself. \"What can you\nexpect from the fellow?\" said dour Major Callendar. \"No grits, no\nguts.\" But in his heart he knew that if Aziz and not he had operated\nlast year on Mrs. Graysford's appendix, the old lady would probably\nhave lived. And this did not dispose him any better towards his\nsubordinate.\n\nThere was a row the morning after the mosque   they were always\nhaving rows. The Major, who had been up half the night, wanted damn\nwell to know why Aziz had not come promptly when summoned.\n\n\"Sir, excuse me, I did. I mounted my bike, and it bust in front of\nthe Cow Hospital. So I had to find a tonga.\"\n\n\"Bust in front of the Cow Hospital, did it? And how did you come\nto be there?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Oh Lord, oh Lord! When I live here\"   he kicked the gravel   \"and you\nlive there   not ten minutes from me   and the Cow Hospital is right\never so far away the other side of you   _there_   then how did you\ncome to be passing the Cow Hospital on the way to me? Now do some\nwork for a change.\"\n\nHe strode away in a temper, without waiting for the excuse, which\nas far as it went was a sound one: the Cow Hospital was in a\nstraight line between Hamidullah's house and his own, so Aziz had\nnaturally passed it. He never realized that the educated Indians\nvisited one another constantly, and were weaving, however painfully,\na new social fabric. Caste \"or something of the sort\" would prevent\nthem. He only knew that no one ever told him the truth, although\nhe had been in the country for twenty years.\n\nAziz watched him go with amusement. When his spirits were up he\nfelt that the English are a comic institution, and he enjoyed being\nmisunderstood by them. But it was an amusement of the emotions and\nnerves, which an accident or the passage of time might destroy; it\nwas apart from the fundamental gaiety that he reached when he was\nwith those whom he trusted. A disobliging simile involving Mrs.\nCallendar occurred to his fancy. \"I must tell that to Mahmoud Ali,\nit'll make him laugh,\" he thought. Then he got to work. He was\ncompetent and indispensable, and he knew it. The simile passed from\nhis mind while he exercised his professional skill.\n\nDuring these pleasant and busy days, he heard vaguely that the\nCollector was giving a party, and that the Nawab Bahadur said every\none ought to go to it. His fellow-assistant, Doctor Panna Lal, was\nin ecstasies at the prospect, and was urgent that they should\nattend it together in his new tum-tum. The arrangement suited them\nboth. Aziz was spared the indignity of a bicycle or the expense of\nhiring, while Dr. Panna Lal, who was timid and elderly, secured\nsomeone who could manage his horse. He could manage it himself,\nbut only just, and he was afraid of the motors and of the unknown\nturn into the club grounds. \"Disaster may come,\" he said politely,\n\"but we shall at all events get there safe, even if we do not get\nback.\" And with more logic: \"It will, I think, create a good\nimpression should two doctors arrive at the same time.\"\n\nBut when the time came, Aziz was seized with a revulsion, and\ndetermined not to go. For one thing his spell of work, lately\nconcluded, left him independent and healthy. For another, the day\nchanced to fall on the anniversary of his wife's death. She had\ndied soon after he had fallen in love with her; he had not loved\nher at first. Touched by Western feeling, he disliked union with\na woman whom he had never seen; moreover, when he did see her, she\ndisappointed him, and he begat his first child in mere animality.\nThe change began after its birth. He was won by her love for him,\nby a loyalty that implied something more than submission, and by\nher efforts to educate herself against that lifting of the purdah\nthat would come in the next generation if not in theirs. She was\nintelligent, yet had old-fashioned grace. Gradually he lost the\nfeeling that his relatives had chosen wrongly for him. Sensuous\nenjoyment   well, even if he had had it, it would have dulled in a\nyear, and he had gained something instead, which seemed to increase\nthe longer they lived together. She became the mother of a son . . .\nand in giving him a second son she died. Then he realized what\nhe had lost, and that no woman could ever take her place; a friend\nwould come nearer to her than another woman. She had gone, there\nwas no one like her, and what is that uniqueness but love? He\namused himself, he forgot her at times: but at other times he felt\nthat she had sent all the beauty and joy of the world into Paradise,\nand he meditated suicide. Would he meet her beyond the tomb? Is\nthere such a meeting-place? Though orthodox, he did not know. God's\nunity was indubitable and indubitably announced, but on all other\npoints he wavered like the average Christian; his belief in the\nlife to come would pale to a hope, vanish, reappear, all in a\nsingle sentence or a dozen heart-beats, so that the corpuscles of\nhis blood rather than he seemed to decide which opinion he should\nhold, and for how long. It was so with all his opinions. Nothing\nstayed, nothing passed that did not return; the circulation was\nceaseless and kept him young, and he mourned his wife the more\nsincerely because he mourned her seldom.\n\nIt would have been simpler to tell Dr. Lal that he had changed his\nmind about the party, but until the last minute he did not know\nthat he had changed it; indeed, he didn't change it, it changed\nitself. Unconquerable aversion welled. Mrs. Callendar, Mrs.\nLesley   no, he couldn't stand them in his sorrow: they would guess\nit   for he dowered the British matron with strange insight   and would\ndelight in torturing him, they would mock him to their husbands.\nWhen he should have been ready, he stood at the Post Office,\nwriting a telegram to his children, and found on his return that\nDr. Lal had called for him, and gone on. Well, let him go on, as\nbefitted the coarseness of his nature. For his own part, he would\ncommune with the dead.\n\nAnd unlocking a drawer, he took out his wife's photograph. He gazed\nat it, and tears spouted from his eyes. He thought, \"How unhappy\nI am!\" But because he really was unhappy, another emotion soon\nmingled with his self-pity: he desired to remember his wife and\ncould not. Why could he remember people whom he did not love? They\nwere always so vivid to him, whereas the more he looked at this\nphotograph, the less he saw. She had eluded him thus, ever since\nthey had carried her to her tomb. He had known that she would pass\nfrom his hands and eyes, but had thought she could live in his\nmind, not realizing that the very fact that we have loved the dead\nincreases their unreality, and that the more passionately we invoke\nthem the further they recede. A piece of brown cardboard and three\nchildren   that was all that was left of his wife. It was unbearable,\nand he thought again, \"How unhappy I am!\" and became happier. He\nhad breathed for an instant the mortal air that surrounds Orientals\nand all men, and he drew back from it with a gasp, for he was\nyoung. \"Never, never shall I get over this,\" he told himself. \"Most\ncertainly my career is a failure, and my sons will be badly brought\nup.\" Since it was certain, he strove to avert it, and looked at\nsome notes he had made on a case at the hospital. Perhaps some day\na rich person might require this particular operation, and he gain\na large sum. The notes interesting him on their own account, he\nlocked the photograph up again. Its moment was over, and he did\nnot think about his wife any more.\n\nAfter tea his spirits improved, and he went round to see Hamidullah.\nHamidullah had gone to the party, but his pony had not, so Aziz\nborrowed it, also his friend's riding breeches and polo mallet. He\nrepaired to the Maidan. It was deserted except at its rim, where\nsome bazaar youths were training. Training for what? They would\nhave found it hard to say, but the word had got into the air. Round\nthey ran, weedy and knock-kneed   the local physique was wretched   with\nan expression on their faces not so much of determination as of a\ndetermination to be determined. \"Maharajah, salaam,\" he called for\na joke. The youths stopped and laughed. He advised them not to\nexert themselves. They promised they would not, and ran on.\n\nRiding into the middle, he began to knock the ball about. He could\nnot play, but his pony could, and he set himself to learn, free\nfrom all human tension. He forgot the whole damned business of\nliving as he scurried over the brown platter of the Maidan, with\nthe evening wind on his forehead, and the encircling trees soothing\nhis eyes. The ball shot away towards a stray subaltern who was also\npractising; he hit it back to Aziz and called, \"Send it along\nagain.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nThe new-comer had some notion of what to do, but his horse had\nnone, and forces were equal. Concentrated on the ball, they somehow\nbecame fond of one another, and smiled when they drew rein to rest.\nAziz liked soldiers   they either accepted you or swore at you, which\nwas preferable to the civilian's hauteur   and the subaltern liked\nanyone who could ride.\n\n\"Often play?\" he asked.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Let's have another chukker.\"\n\nAs he hit, his horse bucked and off he went, cried, \"Oh God!\" and\njumped on again. \"Don't you ever fall off?\"\n\n\"Plenty.\"\n\n\"Not you.\"\n\nThey reined up again, the fire of good fellowship in their eyes.\nBut it cooled with their bodies, for athletics can only raise a\ntemporary glow. Nationality was returning, but before it could\nexert its poison they parted, saluting each other. \"If only they\nwere all like that,\" each thought.\n\nNow it was sunset. A few of his co-religionists had come to the\nMaidan, and were praying with their faces towards Mecca. A Brahminy\nBull walked towards them, and Aziz, though disinclined to pray\nhimself, did not see why they should be bothered with the clumsy\nand idolatrous animal. He gave it a tap with his polo mallet. As\nhe did so, a voice from the road hailed him: it was Dr. Panna Lal,\nreturning in high distress from the Collector's party.\n\n\"Dr. Aziz, Dr. Aziz, where you been? I waited ten full minutes'\ntime at your house, then I went.\"\n\n\"I am so awfully sorry   I was compelled to go to the Post Office.\"\n\nOne of his own circle would have accepted this as meaning that he\nhad changed his mind, an event too common to merit censure. But\nDr. Lal, being of low extraction, was not sure whether an insult\nhad not been intended, and he was further annoyed because Aziz had\nbuffeted the Brahminy Bull. \"Post Office? Do you not send your\nservants?\" he said.\n\n\"I have so few   my scale is very small.\"\n\n\"Your servant spoke to me. I saw your servant.\"\n\n\"But, Dr. Lal, consider. How could I send my servant when you were\ncoming: you come, we go, my house is left alone, my servant comes\nback perhaps, and all my portable property has been carried away\nby bad characters in the meantime. Would you have that? The cook\nis deaf   I can never count on my cook   and the boy is only a little\nboy. Never, never do I and Hassan leave the house at the same time\ntogether. It is my fixed rule.\" He said all this and much more out\nof civility, to save Dr. Lal's face. It was not offered as truth\nand should not have been criticized as such. But the other\ndemolished it   an easy and ignoble task. \"Even if this so, what\nprevents leaving a chit saying where you go?\" and so on. Aziz\ndetested ill breeding, and made his pony caper. \"Farther away, or\nmine will start out of sympathy,\" he wailed, revealing the true\nsource of his irritation. \"It has been so rough and wild this\nafternoon. It spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club\ngarden, and had to be dragged back by four men. English ladies and\ngentlemen looking on, and the Collector Sahib himself taking a\nnote. But, Dr. Aziz, I'll not take up your valuable time. This will\nnot interest you, who have so many engagements and telegrams. I am\njust a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when\nI was asked and where I was asked. Your absence, I may remark, drew\ncommentaries.\"\n\n\"They can damn well comment.\"\n\n\"It is fine to be young. Damn well! Oh, very fine. Damn whom?\"\n\n\"I go or not as I please.\"\n\n\"Yet you promise me, and then fabricate this tale of a telegram.\nGo forward, Dapple.\"\n\nThey went, and Aziz had a wild desire to make an enemy for life.\nHe could do it so easily by galloping near them. He did it. Dapple\nbolted. He thundered back on to the Maidan. The glory of his play\nwith the subaltern remained for a little, he galloped and swooped\ntill he poured with sweat, and until he returned the pony to\nHamidullah's stable he felt the equal of any man. Once on his feet,\nhe had creeping fears. Was he in bad odour with the powers that\nbe? Had he offended the Collector by absenting himself? Dr. Panna\nLal was a person of no importance, yet was it wise to have\nquarrelled even with him? The complexion of his mind turned from\nhuman to political. He thought no longer, \"Can I get on with\npeople?\" but \"Are they stronger than I?\" breathing the prevalent\nmiasma.\n\nAt his home a chit was awaiting him, bearing the Government stamp.\nIt lay on his table like a high explosive, which at a touch might\nblow his flimsy bungalow to bits. He was going to be cashiered\nbecause he had not turned up at the party. When he opened the note,\nit proved to be quite different; an invitation from Mr. Fielding,\nthe Principal of Government College, asking him to come to tea the\nday after to-morrow. His spirits revived with violence. They would\nhave revived in any case, for he possessed a soul that could suffer\nbut not stifle, and led a steady life beneath his mutability. But\nthis invitation gave him particular joy, because Fielding had asked\nhim to tea a month ago, and he had forgotten about it   never\nanswered, never gone, just forgotten.\n\nAnd here came a second invitation, without a rebuke or even an\nallusion to his slip. Here was true courtesy   the civil deed that\nshows the good heart   and snatching up his pen he wrote an\naffectionate reply, and hurried back for news to Hamidullah's. For\nhe had never met the Principal, and believed that the one serious\ngap in his life was going to be filled. He longed to know everything\nabout the splendid fellow   his salary, preferences, antecedents,\nhow best one might please him. But Hamidullah was still out, and\nMahmoud Ali, who was in, would only make silly rude jokes about\nthe party.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " VII\n\n\nThis Mr. Fielding had been caught by India late. He was over forty\nwhen he entered that oddest portal, the Victoria Terminus at\nBombay, and   having bribed a European ticket inspector   took his\nluggage into the compartment of his first tropical train. The\njourney remained in his mind as significant. Of his two carriage\ncompanions one was a youth, fresh to the East like himself, the\nother a seasoned Anglo-Indian of his own age. A gulf divided him\nfrom either; he had seen too many cities and men to be the first\nor to become the second. New impressions crowded on him, but they\nwere not the orthodox new impressions; the past conditioned them,\nand so it was with his mistakes. To regard an Indian as if he were\nan Italian is not, for instance, a common error, nor perhaps a\nfatal one, and Fielding often attempted analogies between this\npeninsula and that other, smaller and more exquisitely shaped, that\nstretches into the classic waters of the Mediterranean.\n\nHis career, though scholastic, was varied, and had included going\nto the bad and repenting thereafter. By now he was a hard-bitten,\ngood-tempered, intelligent fellow on the verge of middle age, with\na belief in education. He did not mind whom he taught; public\nschoolboys, mental defectives and policemen, had all come his way,\nand he had no objection to adding Indians. Through the influence\nof friends, he was nominated Principal of the little college at\nChandrapore, liked it, and assumed he was a success. He did succeed\nwith his pupils, but the gulf between himself and his countrymen,\nwhich he had noticed in the train, widened distressingly. He could\nnot at first see what was wrong. He was not unpatriotic, he always\ngot on with Englishmen in England, all his best friends were\nEnglish, so why was it not the same out here? Outwardly of the\nlarge shaggy type, with sprawling limbs and blue eyes, he appeared\nto inspire confidence until he spoke. Then something in his manner\npuzzled people and failed to allay the distrust which his profession\nnaturally inspired. There needs must be this evil of brains in\nIndia, but woe to him through whom they are increased! The feeling\ngrew that Mr. Fielding was a disruptive force, and rightly, for\nideas are fatal to caste, and he used ideas by that most potent\nmethod   interchange. Neither a missionary nor a student, he was\nhappiest in the give-and-take of a private conversation. The world,\nhe believed, is a globe of men who are trying to reach one another\nand can best do so by the help of good will plus culture and\nintelligence   a creed ill suited to Chandrapore, but he had come\nout too late to lose it. He had no racial feeling   not because he\nwas superior to his brother civilians, but because he had matured\nin a different atmosphere, where the herd-instinct does not\nflourish. The remark that did him most harm at the club was a silly\naside to the effect that the so-called white races are really\npinko-grey. He only said this to be cheery, he did not realize that\n\"white\" has no more to do with a colour than \"God save the King\"\nwith a god, and that it is the height of impropriety to consider\nwhat it does connote. The pinko-grey male whom he addressed was\nsubtly scandalized; his sense of insecurity was awoken, and he\ncommunicated it to the rest of the herd.\n\nStill, the men tolerated him for the sake of his good heart and\nstrong body; it was their wives who decided that he was not a sahib\nreally. They disliked him. He took no notice of them, and this,\nwhich would have passed without comment in feminist England, did\nhim harm in a community where the male is expected to be lively\nand helpful. Mr. Fielding never advised one about dogs or horses,\nor dined, or paid his midday calls, or decorated trees for one's\nchildren at Christmas, and though he came to the club, it was only\nto get his tennis or billiards, and to go. This was true. He had\ndiscovered that it is possible to keep in with Indians and\nEnglishmen, but that he who would also keep in with Englishwomen\nmust drop the Indians. The two wouldn't combine. Useless to blame\neither party, useless to blame them for blaming one another. It\njust was so, and one had to choose. Most Englishmen preferred their\nown kinswomen, who, coming out in increasing numbers, made life on\nthe home pattern yearly more possible. He had found it convenient\nand pleasant to associate with Indians and he must pay the price.\nAs a rule no Englishwoman entered the College except for official\nfunctions, and if he invited Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested to tea,\nit was because they were new-comers who would view everything with\nan equal if superficial eye, and would not turn on a special voice\nwhen speaking to his other guests.\n\nThe College itself had been slapped down by the Public Works\nDepartment, but its grounds included an ancient garden and a\ngarden-house, and here he lived for much of the year. He was\ndressing after a bath when Dr. Aziz was announced. Lifting up his\nvoice, he shouted from the bedroom, \"Please make yourself at home.\"\nThe remark was unpremeditated, like most of his actions; it was\nwhat he felt inclined to say.\n\nTo Aziz it had a very definite meaning. \"May I really, Mr. Fielding?\nIt's very good of you,\" he called back; \"I like unconventional\nbehaviour so extremely.\" His spirits flared up, he glanced round\nthe living-room. Some luxury in it, but no order   nothing to\nintimidate poor Indians. It was also a very beautiful room, opening\ninto the garden through three high arches of wood. \"The fact is I\nhave long wanted to meet you,\" he continued. \"I have heard so much\nabout your warm heart from the Nawab Bahadur. But where is one to\nmeet in a wretched hole like Chandrapore?\" He came close up to the\ndoor. \"When I was greener here, I'll tell you what. I used to wish\nyou to fall ill so that we could meet that way.\" They laughed, and\nencouraged by his success he began to improvise. \"I said to myself,\nHow does Mr. Fielding look this morning? Perhaps pale. And the\nCivil Surgeon is pale too, he will not be able to attend upon him\nwhen the shivering commences. I should have been sent for instead.\nThen we would have had jolly talks, for you are a celebrated\nstudent of Persian poetry.\"\n\n\"You know me by sight, then.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. You know me?\"\n\n\"I know you very well by name.\"\n\n\"I have been here such a short time, and always in the bazaar. No\nwonder you have never seen me, and I wonder you know my name. I\nsay, Mr. Fielding?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Guess what I look like before you come out. That will be a kind\nof game.\"\n\n\"You're five feet nine inches high,\" said Fielding, surmising this\nmuch through the ground glass of the bedroom door.\n\n\"Jolly good. What next? Have I not a venerable white beard?\"\n\n\"Blast!\"\n\n\"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"I've stamped on my last collar stud.\"\n\n\"Take mine, take mine.\"\n\n\"Have you a spare one?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, one minute.\"\n\n\"Not if you're wearing it yourself.\"\n\n\"No, no, one in my pocket.\" Stepping aside, so that his outline\nmight vanish, he wrenched off his collar, and pulled out of his\nshirt the back stud, a gold stud, which was part of a set that his\nbrother-in-law had brought him from Europe. \"Here it is,\" he cried.\n\n\"Come in with it if you don't mind the unconventionality.\"\n\n\"One minute again.\" Replacing his collar, he prayed that it would\nnot spring up at the back during tea. Fielding's bearer, who was\nhelping him to dress, opened the door for him.\n\n\"Many thanks.\" They shook hands smiling. He began to look round,\nas he would have with any old friend. Fielding was not surprised\nat the rapidity of their intimacy. With so emotional a people it\nwas apt to come at once or never, and he and Aziz, having heard\nonly good of each other, could afford to dispense with preliminaries.\n\n\"But I always thought that Englishmen kept their rooms so tidy. It\nseems that this is not so. I need not be so ashamed.\" He sat down\ngaily on the bed; then, forgetting himself entirely, drew up his\nlegs and folded them under him. \"Everything ranged coldly on\nshelves was what _I_ thought.   I say, Mr. Fielding, is the stud\ngoing to go in?\"\n\n\"I hae ma doots.\"\n\n\"What's that last sentence, please? Will you teach me some new\nwords and so improve my English?\"\n\nFielding doubted whether \"everything ranged coldly on shelves\"\ncould be improved. He was often struck with the liveliness with\nwhich the younger generation handled a foreign tongue. They altered\nthe idiom, but they could say whatever they wanted to say quickly;\nthere were none of the babuisms ascribed to them up at the club.\nBut then the club moved slowly; it still declared that few\nMohammedans and no Hindus would eat at an Englishman's table, and\nthat all Indian ladies were in impenetrable purdah. Individually\nit knew better; as a club it declined to change.\n\n\"Let me put in your stud. I see . . . the shirt back's hole is\nrather small and to rip it wider a pity.\"\n\n\"Why in hell does one wear collars at all?\" grumbled Fielding as\nhe bent his neck.\n\n\"We wear them to pass the Police.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"If I'm biking in English dress   starch collar, hat with ditch   they\ntake no notice. When I wear a fez, they cry,    Your lamp's out!'\nLord Curzon did not consider this when he urged natives of India\nto retain their picturesque costumes.   Hooray! Stud's gone\nin.   Sometimes I shut my eyes and dream I have splendid clothes\nagain and am riding into battle behind Alamgir. Mr. Fielding, must\nnot India have been beautiful then, with the Mogul Empire at its\nheight and Alamgir reigning at Delhi upon the Peacock Throne?\"\n\n\"Two ladies are coming to tea to meet you   I think you know them.\"\n\n\"Meet me? I know no ladies.\"\n\n\"Not Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"Oh yes   I remember.\" The romance at the mosque had sunk out of his\nconsciousness as soon as it was over. \"An excessively aged lady;\nbut will you please repeat the name of her companion?\"\n\n\"Miss Quested.\"\n\n\"Just as you wish.\" He was disappointed that other guests were\ncoming, for he preferred to be alone with his new friend.\n\n\"You can talk to Miss Quested about the Peacock Throne if you\nlike   she's artistic, they say.\"\n\n\"Is she a Post Impressionist?\"\n\n\"Post Impressionism, indeed! Come along to tea. This world is\ngetting too much for me altogether.\"\n\nAziz was offended. The remark suggested that he, an obscure Indian,\nhad no right to have heard of Post Impressionism   a privilege\nreserved for the Ruling Race, that. He said stiffly, \"I do not\nconsider Mrs. Moore my friend, I only met her accidentally in my\nmosque,\" and was adding \"a single meeting is too short to make a\nfriend,\" but before he could finish the sentence the stiffness\nvanished from it, because he felt Fielding's fundamental good will.\nHis own went out to it, and grappled beneath the shifting tides of\nemotion which can alone bear the voyager to an anchorage but may\nalso carry him across it on to the rocks. He was safe really   as\nsafe as the shore-dweller who can only understand stability and\nsupposes that every ship must be wrecked, and he had sensations\nthe shore-dweller cannot know. Indeed, he was sensitive rather than\nresponsive. In every remark he found a meaning, but not always the\ntrue meaning, and his life though vivid was largely a dream.\nFielding, for instance, had not meant that Indians are obscure,\nbut that Post Impressionism is; a gulf divided his remark from Mrs.\nTurton's \"Why, they speak English,\" but to Aziz the two sounded\nalike. Fielding saw that something had gone wrong, and equally that\nit had come right, but he didn't fidget, being an optimist where\npersonal relations were concerned, and their talk rattled on as\nbefore.\n\n\"Besides the ladies I am expecting one of my assistants   Narayan\nGodbole.\"\n\n\"Oho, the Deccani Brahman!\"\n\n\"He wants the past back too, but not precisely Alamgir.\"\n\n\"I should think not. Do you know what Deccani Brahmans say? That\nEngland conquered India from them   from them, mind, and not from\nthe Moguls. Is not that like their cheek? They have even bribed it\nto appear in text-books, for they are so subtle and immensely rich.\nProfessor Godbole must be quite unlike all other Deccani Brahmans\nfrom all I can hear say. A most sincere chap.\"\n\n\"Why don't you fellows run a club in Chandrapore, Aziz?\"\n\n\"Perhaps   some day . . . just now I see Mrs. Moore and   what's her\nname   coming.\"\n\nHow fortunate that it was an \"unconventional\" party, where\nformalities are ruled out! On this basis Aziz found the English\nladies easy to talk to, he treated them like men. Beauty would have\ntroubled him, for it entails rules of its own, but Mrs. Moore was\nso old and Miss Quested so plain that he was spared this anxiety.\nAdela's angular body and the freckles on her face were terrible\ndefects in his eyes, and he wondered how God could have been so\nunkind to any female form. His attitude towards her remained\nentirely straightforward in consequence.\n\n\"I want to ask you something, Dr. Aziz,\" she began. \"I heard from\nMrs. Moore how helpful you were to her in the mosque, and how\ninteresting. She learnt more about India in those few minutes' talk\nwith you than in the three weeks since we landed.\"\n\n\"Oh, please do not mention a little thing like that. Is there\nanything else I may tell you about my country?\"\n\n\"I want you to explain a disappointment we had this morning; it\nmust be some point of Indian etiquette.\"\n\n\"There honestly is none,\" he replied. \"We are by nature a most\ninformal people.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence,\"\nsaid Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"That is even more impossible. But may I know the facts?\"\n\n\"An Indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us\nthis morning at nine. It has never come. We waited and waited and\nwaited; we can't think what happened.\"\n\n\"Some misunderstanding,\" said Fielding, seeing at once that it was\nthe type of incident that had better not be cleared up.\n\n\"Oh no, it wasn't that,\" Miss Quested persisted. \"They even gave\nup going to Calcutta to entertain us. We must have made some stupid\nblunder, we both feel sure.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about that.\"\n\n\"Exactly what Mr. Heaslop tells me,\" she retorted, reddening a\nlittle. \"If one doesn't worry, how's one to understand?\"\n\nThe host was inclined to change the subject, but Aziz took it up\nwarmly, and on learning fragments of the delinquents' name\npronounced that they were Hindus.\n\n\"Slack Hindus   they have no idea of society; I know them very well\nbecause of a doctor at the hospital. Such a slack, unpunctual\nfellow! It is as well you did not go to their house, for it would\ngive you a wrong idea of India. Nothing sanitary. I think for my\nown part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did\nnot send.\"\n\n\"That's a notion,\" said the other man.\n\n\"I do so hate mysteries,\" Adela announced.\n\n\"We English do.\"\n\n\"I dislike them not because I'm English, but from my own personal\npoint of view,\" she corrected.\n\n\"I like mysteries but I rather dislike muddles,\" said Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"A mystery is a muddle.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you think so, Mr. Fielding?\"\n\n\"A mystery is only a high-sounding term for a muddle. No advantage\nin stirring it up, in either case. Aziz and I know well that\nIndia's a muddle.\"\n\n\"India's       Oh, what an alarming idea!\"\n\n\"There'll be no muddle when you come to see me,\" said Aziz, rather\nout of his depth. \"Mrs. Moore and everyone   I invite you all   oh,\nplease.\"\n\nThe old lady accepted: she still thought the young doctor\nexcessively nice; moreover, a new feeling, half languor, half\nexcitement, bade her turn down any fresh path. Miss Quested accepted\nout of adventure. She also liked Aziz, and believed that when she\nknew him better he would unlock his country for her. His invitation\ngratified her, and she asked him for his address.\n\nAziz thought of his bungalow with horror. It was a detestable\nshanty near a low bazaar. There was practically only one room in\nit, and that infested with small black flies. \"Oh, but we will talk\nof something else now,\" he exclaimed. \"I wish I lived here. See\nthis beautiful room! Let us admire it together for a little. See\nthose curves at the bottom of the arches. What delicacy! It is the\narchitecture of Question and Answer. Mrs. Moore, you are in India;\nI am not joking.\" The room inspired him. It was an audience hall\nbuilt in the eighteenth century for some high official, and though\nof wood had reminded Fielding of the Loggia de' Lanzi at Florence.\nLittle rooms, now Europeanized, clung to it on either side, but\nthe central hall was unpapered and unglassed, and the air of the\ngarden poured in freely. One sat in public   on exhibition, as it\nwere   in full view of the gardeners who were screaming at the birds\nand of the man who rented the tank for the cultivation of water\nchestnut. Fielding let the mango trees too   there was no knowing\nwho might not come in   and his servants sat on his steps night and\nday to discourage thieves. Beautiful certainly, and the Englishman\nhad not spoilt it, whereas Aziz in an occidental moment would have\nhung Maude Goodmans on the walls. Yet there was no doubt to whom\nthe room really belonged. . . .\n\n\"I am doing justice here. A poor widow who has been robbed comes\nalong and I give her fifty rupees, to another a hundred, and so on\nand so on. I should like that.\"\n\nMrs. Moore smiled, thinking of the modern method as exemplified in\nher son. \"Rupees don't last for ever, I'm afraid,\" she said.\n\n\"Mine would. God would give me more when he saw I gave. Always be\ngiving, like the Nawab Bahadur. My father was the same, that is\nwhy he died poor.\" And pointing about the room he peopled it with\nclerks and officials, all benevolent because they lived long ago.\n\"So we would sit giving for ever   on a carpet instead of chairs,\nthat is the chief change between now and then, but I think we would\nnever punish anyone.\"\n\nThe ladies agreed.\n\n\"Poor criminal, give him another chance. It only makes a man worse\nto go to prison and be corrupted.\" His face grew very tender   the\ntenderness of one incapable of administration, and unable to grasp\nthat if the poor criminal is let off he will again rob the poor\nwidow. He was tender to everyone except a few family enemies whom\nhe did not consider human: on these he desired revenge. He was even\ntender to the English; he knew at the bottom of his heart that they\ncould not help being so cold and odd and circulating like an ice\nstream through his land. \"We punish no one, no one,\" he repeated,\n\"and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and\nlovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks\nin their hands, and all shall be feasting and happiness until the\nnext day, when there shall be justice as before   fifty rupees, a\nhundred, a thousand   till peace comes. Ah, why didn't we live in\nthat time?   But are you admiring Mr. Fielding's house? Do look how\nthe pillars are painted blue, and the verandah's pavilions   what do\nyou call them?   that are above us inside are blue also. Look at the\ncarving on the pavilions. Think of the hours it took. Their little\nroofs are curved to imitate bamboo. So pretty   and the bamboos\nwaving by the tank outside. Mrs. Moore! Mrs. Moore!\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said, laughing.\n\n\"You remember the water by our mosque? It comes down and fills this\ntank   a skilful arrangement of the Emperors. They stopped here going\ndown into Bengal. They loved water. Wherever they went they created\nfountains, gardens, hammams. I was telling Mr. Fielding I would\ngive anything to serve them.\"\n\nHe was wrong about the water, which no Emperor, however skilful,\ncan cause to gravitate uphill; a depression of some depth together\nwith the whole of Chandrapore lay between the mosque and Fielding's\nhouse. Ronny would have pulled him up, Turton would have wanted to\npull him up, but restrained himself. Fielding did not even want to\npull him up; he had dulled his craving for verbal truth and cared\nchiefly for truth of mood. As for Miss Quested, she accepted\neverything Aziz said as true verbally. In her ignorance, she\nregarded him as \"India,\" and never surmised that his outlook was\nlimited and his method inaccurate, and that no one is India.\n\nHe was now much excited, chattering away hard, and even saying damn\nwhen he got mixed up in his sentences. He told them of his\nprofession, and of the operations he had witnessed and performed,\nand he went into details that scared Mrs. Moore, though Miss\nQuested mistook them for proofs of his broad-mindedness; she had\nheard such talk at home in advanced academic circles, deliberately\nfree. She supposed him to be emancipated as well as reliable, and\nplaced him on a pinnacle which he could not retain. He was high\nenough for the moment, to be sure, but not on any pinnacle. Wings\nbore him up, and flagging would deposit him.\n\nThe arrival of Professor Godbole quieted him somewhat, but it\nremained his afternoon. The Brahman, polite and enigmatic, did not\nimpede his eloquence, and even applauded it. He took his tea at a\nlittle distance from the outcasts, from a low table placed slightly\nbehind him, to which he stretched back, and as it were encountered\nfood by accident; all feigned indifference to Professor Godbole's\ntea. He was elderly and wizen with a grey moustache and grey-blue\neyes, and his complexion was as fair as a European's. He wore a\nturban that looked like pale purple macaroni, coat, waistcoat,\ndhoti, socks with clocks. The clocks matched the turban, and his\nwhole appearance suggested harmony   as if he had reconciled the\nproducts of East and West, mental as well as physical, and could\nnever be discomposed. The ladies were interested in him, and hoped\nthat he would supplement Dr. Aziz by saying something about\nreligion. But he only ate   ate and ate, smiling, never letting his\neyes catch sight of his hand.\n\nLeaving the Mogul Emperors, Aziz turned to topics that could\ndistress no one. He described the ripening of the mangoes, and how\nin his boyhood he used to run out in the Rains to a big mango grove\nbelonging to an uncle and gorge there. \"Then back with water\nstreaming over you and perhaps rather a pain inside. But I did not\nmind. All my friends were paining with me. We have a proverb in\nUrdu:    What does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy\ntogether?' which comes in conveniently after mangoes. Miss Quested,\ndo wait for mangoes. Why not settle altogether in India?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that,\" said Adela. She made the remark\nwithout thinking what it meant. To her, as to the three men, it\nseemed in key with the rest of the conversation, and not for\nseveral minutes   indeed, not for half an hour   did she realize that\nit was an important remark, and ought to have been made in the\nfirst place to Ronny.\n\n\"Visitors like you are too rare.\"\n\n\"They are indeed,\" said Professor Godbole. \"Such affability is\nseldom seen. But what can we offer to detain them?\"\n\n\"Mangoes, mangoes.\"\n\nThey laughed. \"Even mangoes can be got in England now,\" put in\nFielding. \"They ship them in ice-cold rooms. You can make India in\nEngland apparently, just as you can make England in India.\"\n\n\"Frightfully expensive in both cases,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"And nasty.\"\n\nBut the host wouldn't allow the conversation to take this heavy\nturn. He turned to the old lady, who looked flustered and put\nout   he could not imagine why   and asked about her own plans. She\nreplied that she should like to see over the College. Everyone\nimmediately rose, with the exception of Professor Godbole, who was\nfinishing a banana.\n\n\"Don't you come too, Adela; you dislike institutions.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" said Miss Quested, and sat down again.\n\nAziz hesitated. His audience was splitting up. The more familiar\nhalf was going, but the more attentive remained. Reflecting that\nit was an \"unconventional\" afternoon, he stopped.\n\nTalk went on as before. Could one offer the visitors unripe mangoes\nin a fool? \"I speak now as a doctor: no.\" Then the old man said,\n\"But I will send you up a few healthy sweets. I will give myself\nthat pleasure.\"\n\n\"Miss Quested, Professor Godbole's sweets are delicious,\" said Aziz\nsadly, for he wanted to send sweets too and had no wife to cook\nthem. \"They will give you a real Indian treat. Ah, in my poor\nposition I can give you nothing.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you say that, when you have so kindly asked us\nto your house.\"\n\nHe thought again of his bungalow with horror. Good heavens, the\nstupid girl had taken him at his word! What was he to do? \"Yes,\nall that is settled,\" he cried.\n\n\"I invite you all to see me in the Marabar Caves.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor\nsweets. But has not Miss Quested visited our caves already?\"\n\n\"No. I've not even heard of them.\"\n\n\"Not heard of them?\" both cried. \"The Marabar Caves in the Marabar\nHills?\"\n\n\"We hear nothing interesting up at the club. Only tennis and\nridiculous gossip.\"\n\nThe old man was silent, perhaps feeling that it was unseemly of\nher to criticize her race, perhaps fearing that if he agreed she\nwould report him for disloyalty. But the young man uttered a rapid\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Then tell me everything you will, or I shall never understand\nIndia. Are they the hills I sometimes see in the evening? What are\nthese caves?\"\n\nAziz undertook to explain, but it presently appeared that he had\nnever visited the caves himself   had always been \"meaning\" to go,\nbut work or private business had prevented him, and they were so\nfar. Professor Godbole chaffed him pleasantly. \"My dear young sir,\nthe pot and the kettle! Have you ever heard of that useful proverb?\"\n\n\"Are they large caves?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, not large.\"\n\n\"Do describe them, Professor Godbole.\"\n\n\"It will be a great honour.\" He drew up his chair and an expression\nof tension came over his face. Taking the cigarette box, she\noffered to him and to Aziz, and lit up herself. After an impressive\npause he said: \"There is an entrance in the rock which you enter,\nand through the entrance is the cave.\"\n\n\"Something like the caves at Elephanta?\"\n\n\"Oh no, not at all; at Elephanta there are sculptures of Siva and\nParvati. There are no sculptures at Marabar.\"\n\n\"They are immensely holy, no doubt,\" said Aziz, to help on the\nnarrative.\n\n\"Oh no, oh no.\"\n\n\"Still, they are ornamented in some way.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Well, why are they so famous? We all talk of the famous Marabar\nCaves. Perhaps that is our empty brag.\"\n\n\"No, I should not quite say that.\"\n\n\"Describe them to this lady, then.\"\n\n\"It will be a great pleasure.\" He forewent the pleasure, and Aziz\nrealized that he was keeping back something about the caves. He\nrealized because he often suffered from similar inhibitions himself.\nSometimes, to the exasperation of Major Callendar, he would pass\nover the one relevant fact in a position, to dwell on the hundred\nirrelevant. The Major accused him of disingenuousness, and was\nroughly right, but only roughly. It was rather that a power he\ncouldn't control capriciously silenced his mind. Godbole had been\nsilenced now; no doubt not willingly, he was concealing something.\nHandled subtly, he might regain control and announce that the\nMarabar Caves were   full of stalactites, perhaps; Aziz led up to\nthis, but they weren't.\n\nThe dialogue remained light and friendly, and Adela had no\nconception of its underdrift. She did not know that the comparatively\nsimple mind of the Mohammedan was encountering Ancient Night. Aziz\nplayed a thrilling game. He was handling a human toy that refused\nto work   he knew that much. If it worked, neither he nor Professor\nGodbole would be the least advantaged, but the attempt enthralled\nhim and was akin to abstract thought. On he chattered, defeated at\nevery move by an opponent who would not even admit that a move had\nbeen made, and further than ever from discovering what, if anything,\nwas extraordinary about the Marabar Caves.\n\nInto this Ronny dropped.\n\nWith an annoyance he took no trouble to conceal, he called from\nthe garden: \"What's happened to Fielding? Where's my mother?\"\n\n\"Good evening!\" she replied coolly.\n\n\"I want you and mother at once. There's to be polo.\"\n\n\"I thought there was to be no polo.\"\n\n\"Everything's altered. Some soldier men have come in. Come along\nand I'll tell you about it.\"\n\n\"Your mother will return shortly, sir,\" said Professor Godbole,\nwho had risen with deference. \"There is but little to see at our\npoor college.\"\n\nRonny took no notice, but continued to address his remarks to\nAdela; he had hurried away from his work to take her to see the\npolo, because he thought it would give her pleasure. He did not\nmean to be rude to the two men, but the only link he could be\nconscious of with an Indian was the official, and neither happened\nto be his subordinate. As private individuals he forgot them.\n\nUnfortunately Aziz was in no mood to be forgotten. He would not\ngive up the secure and intimate note of the last hour. He had not\nrisen with Godbole, and now, offensively friendly, called from his\nseat, \"Come along up and join us, Mr. Heaslop; sit down till your\nmother turns up.\"\n\nRonny replied by ordering one of Fielding's servants to fetch his\nmaster at once.\n\n\"He may not understand that. Allow me      \" Aziz repeated the order\nidiomatically.\n\nRonny was tempted to retort; he knew the type; he knew all the\ntypes, and this was the spoilt Westernized. But he was a servant\nof the Government, it was his job to avoid \"incidents,\" so he said\nnothing, and ignored the provocation that Aziz continued to offer.\nAziz was provocative. Everything he said had an impertinent flavour\nor jarred. His wings were failing, but he refused to fall without\na struggle. He did not mean to be impertinent to Mr. Heaslop, who\nhad never done him harm, but here was an Anglo-Indian who must\nbecome a man before comfort could be regained. He did not mean to\nbe greasily confidential to Miss Quested, only to enlist her\nsupport; nor to be loud and jolly towards Professor Godbole. A\nstrange quartette   he fluttering to the ground, she puzzled by the\nsudden ugliness, Ronny fuming, the Brahman observing all three,\nbut with downcast eyes and hands folded, as if nothing was\nnoticeable. A scene from a play, thought Fielding, who now saw them\nfrom the distance across the garden grouped among the blue pillars\nof his beautiful hall.\n\n\"Don't trouble to come, mother,\" Ronny called; \"we're just\nstarting.\" Then he hurried to Fielding, drew him aside and said\nwith pseudo-heartiness, \"I say, old man, do excuse me, but I think\nperhaps you oughtn't to have left Miss Quested alone.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what's up?\" replied Fielding, also trying to be genial.\n\n\"Well . . . I'm the sun-dried bureaucrat, no doubt; still, I don't\nlike to see an English girl left smoking with two Indians.\"\n\n\"She stopped, as she smokes, by her own wish, old man.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's all right in England.\"\n\n\"I really can't see the harm.\"\n\n\"If you can't see, you can't see. . . . Can't you see that fellow's\na bounder?\"\n\nAziz flamboyant, was patronizing Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"He isn't a bounder,\" protested Fielding. \"His nerves are on edge,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"What should have upset his precious nerves?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was all right when I left.\"\n\n\"Well, it's nothing I've said,\" said Ronny reassuringly. \"I never\neven spoke to him.\"\n\n\"Oh well, come along now, and take your ladies away; the catastrophe\nover.\"\n\n\"Fielding . . . don't think I'm taking it badly, or anything of\nthat sort. . . . I suppose you won't come on to the polo with us?\nWe should all be delighted.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't, thanks all the same. I'm awfully sorry you\nfeel I've been remiss. I didn't mean to be.\"\n\nSo the leave-taking began. Every one was cross or wretched. It was\nas if irritation exuded from the very soil. Could one have been so\npetty on a Scotch moor or an Italian alp? Fielding wondered\nafterwards. There seemed no reserve of tranquillity to draw upon\nin India.\n\nEither none, or else tranquillity swallowed up everything, as it\nappeared to do for Professor Godbole. Here was Aziz all shoddy and\nodious, Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested both silly, and he himself and\nHeaslop both decorous on the surface, but detestable really, and\ndetesting each other.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Fielding, and thank you so much. . . . What lovely\nCollege buildings!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Moore.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Fielding. Such an interesting afternoon. . . .\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Quested.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Dr. Aziz.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Moore.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Dr. Aziz.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Quested.\" He pumped her hand up and down to show\nthat he felt at ease. \"You'll jolly jolly well not forget those\ncaves, won't you? I'll fix the whole show up in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"Thank you. . .\"\n\nInspired by the devil to a final effort, he added, \"What a shame\nyou leave India so soon! Oh, do reconsider your decision, do stay.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Professor Godbole,\" she continued, suddenly agitated.\n\"It's a shame we never heard you sing.\"\n\n\"I may sing now,\" he replied, and did.\n\nHis thin voice rose, and gave out one sound after another. At times\nthere seemed rhythm, at times there was the illusion of a Western\nmelody. But the ear, baffled repeatedly, soon lost any clue, and\nwandered in a maze of noises, none harsh or unpleasant, none\nintelligible. It was the song of an unknown bird. Only the servants\nunderstood it. They began to whisper to one another. The man who\nwas gathering water chestnut came naked out of the tank, his lips\nparted with delight, disclosing his scarlet tongue. The sounds\ncontinued and ceased after a few moments as casually as they had\nbegun   apparently half through a bar, and upon the subdominant.\n\n\"Thanks so much: what was that?\" asked Fielding.\n\n\"I will explain in detail. It was a religious song. I placed myself\nin the position of a milkmaiden. I say to Shri Krishna,    Come! come\nto me only.' The god refuses to come. I grow humble and say:    Do\nnot come to me only. Multiply yourself into a hundred Krishnas,\nand let one go to each of my hundred companions, but one, O Lord\nof the Universe, come to me.' He refuses to come. This is repeated\nseveral times. The song is composed in a raga appropriate to the\npresent hour, which is the evening.\"\n\n\"But He comes in some other song, I hope?\" said Mrs. Moore gently.\n\n\"Oh no, he refuses to come,\" repeated Godbole, perhaps not\nunderstanding her question. \"I say to Him, Come, come, come, come,\ncome, come. He neglects to come.\"\n\nRonny's steps had died away, and there was a moment of absolute\nsilence. No ripple disturbed the water, no leaf stirred.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

India\nhad developed sides of his character that she had never admired.\nHis self-complacency, his censoriousness, his lack of subtlety,\nall grew vivid beneath a tropic sky; he seemed more indifferent\nthan of old to what was passing in the minds of his fellows, more\ncertain that he was right about them or that if he was wrong it\ndidn't matter. When proved wrong, he was particularly exasperating;\nhe always managed to suggest that she needn't have bothered to\nprove it. The point she made was never the relevant point, her\narguments conclusive but barren, she was reminded that he had\nexpert knowledge and she none, and that experience would not help\nher because she could not interpret it. A Public School, London\nUniversity, a year at a crammer's, a particular sequence of posts\nin a particular province, a fall from a horse and a touch of fever\nwere presented to her as the only training by which Indians and\nall who reside in their country can be understood; the only training\nshe could comprehend, that is to say, for of course above Ronny\nthere stretched the higher realms of knowledge, inhabited by\nCallendars and Turtons, who had been not one year in the country\nbut twenty and whose instincts were superhuman. For himself he made\nno extravagant claims; she wished he would. It was the qualified\nbray of the callow official, the \"I am not perfect, but      \" that\ngot on her nerves.\n\nHow gross he had been at Mr. Fielding's   spoiling the talk and\nwalking off in the middle of the haunting song! As he drove them\naway in the tum-tum, her irritation became unbearable, and she did\nnot realize that much of it was directed against herself. She\nlonged for an opportunity to fly out at him, and since he felt\ncross too, and they were both in India, an opportunity soon\noccurred. They had scarcely left the College grounds before she\nheard him say to his mother, who was with him on the front seat,\n\"What was that about caves?\" and she promptly opened fire.\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic,\ninstead of a party in his house; we are to meet him out there   you,\nmyself, Mr. Fielding, Professor Godbole   exactly the same party.\"\n\n\"Out where?\" asked Ronny.\n\n\"The Marabar Caves.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm blessed,\" he murmured after a pause. \"Did he descend to\nany details?\"\n\n\"He did not. If you had spoken to him, we could have arranged\nthem.\"\n\nHe shook his head laughing.\n\n\"Have I said anything funny?\"\n\n\"I was only thinking how the worthy doctor's collar climbed up his\nneck.\"\n\n\"I thought you were discussing the caves.\"\n\n\"So I am. Aziz was exquisitely dressed, from tie-pin to spats, but\nhe had forgotten his back collar-stud, and there you have the\nIndian all over: inattention to detail; the fundamental slackness\nthat reveals the race. Similarly, to    meet' in the caves as if they\nwere the clock at Charing Cross, when they're miles from a station\nand each other.\"\n\n\"Have you been to them?\"\n\n\"No, but I know all about them, naturally.\"\n\n\"Oh naturally!\"\n\n\"Are you too pledged to this expedition, mother?\"\n\n\"Mother is pledged to nothing,\" said Mrs. Moore, rather unexpectedly.\n\"Certainly not to this polo. Will you drive up to the bungalow\nfirst, and drop me there, please? I prefer to rest.\"\n\n\"Drop me too,\" said Adela. \"I don't want to watch polo either, I'm\nsure.\"\n\n\"Simpler to drop the polo,\" said Ronny. Tired and disappointed, he\nquite lost self-control, and added in a loud lecturing voice, \"I\nwon't have you messing about with Indians any more! If you want to\ngo to the Marabar Caves, you'll go under British auspices.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of these caves, I don't know what or where they\nare,\" said Mrs. Moore, \"but I really can't have\"   she tapped the\ncushion beside her   \"so much quarrelling and tiresomeness!\"\n\nThe young people were ashamed. They dropped her at the bungalow\nand drove on together to the polo, feeling it was the least they\ncould do. Their crackling bad humour left them, but the heaviness\nof their spirit remained; thunderstorms seldom clear the air. Miss\nQuested was thinking over her own behaviour, and didn't like it at\nall. Instead of weighing Ronny and herself, and coming to a reasoned\nconclusion about marriage, she had incidentally, in the course of\na talk about mangoes, remarked to mixed company that she didn't\nmean to stop in India. Which meant that she wouldn't marry Ronny:\nbut what a way to announce it, what a way for a civilized girl to\nbehave! She owed him an explanation, but unfortunately there was\nnothing to explain. The \"thorough talk\" so dear to her principles\nand temperament had been postponed until too late. There seemed no\npoint in being disagreeable to him and formulating her complaints\nagainst his character at this hour of the day, which was the\nevening. . . . The polo took place on the Maidan near the entrance\nof Chandrapore city. The sun was already declining and each of the\ntrees held a premonition of night. They walked away from the\ngoverning group to a distant seat, and there, feeling that it was\nhis due and her own, she forced out of herself the undigested\nremark: \"We must have a thorough talk, Ronny, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"My temper's rotten, I must apologize,\" was his reply. \"I didn't\nmean to order you and mother about, but of course the way those\nBengalis let you down this morning annoyed me, and I don't want\nthat sort of thing to keep happening.\"\n\n\"It's nothing to do with them that I . . .\"\n\n\"No, but Aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves. He\nmeant nothing by the invitation, I could tell by his voice; it's\njust their way of being pleasant.\"\n\n\"It's something very different, nothing to do with caves, that I\nwanted to talk over with you.\" She gazed at the colourless grass.\n\"I've finally decided we are not going to be married, my dear boy.\"\n\nThe news hurt Ronny very much. He had heard Aziz announce that she\nwould not return to the country, but had paid no attention to the\nremark, for he never dreamt that an Indian could be a channel of\ncommunication between two English people. He controlled himself\nand said gently, \"You never said we should marry, my dear girl;\nyou never bound either yourself or me   don't let this upset you.\"\n\nShe felt ashamed. How decent he was! He might force his opinions\ndown her throat, but did not press her to an \"engagement,\" because\nhe believed, like herself, in the sanctity of personal relationships:\nit was this that had drawn them together at their first meeting,\nwhich had occurred among the grand scenery of the English Lakes.\nHer ordeal was over, but she felt it should have been more painful\nand longer. Adela will not marry Ronny. It seemed slipping away\nlike a dream. She said, \"But let us discuss things; it's all so\nfrightfully important, we mustn't make false steps. I want next to\nhear your point of view about me   it might help us both.\"\n\nHis manner was unhappy and reserved. \"I don't much believe in this\ndiscussing   besides, I'm so dead with all this extra work Mohurram's\nbringing, if you'll excuse me.\"\n\n\"I only want everything to be absolutely clear between us, and to\nanswer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct.\"\n\n\"But I haven't got any questions. You've acted within your rights,\nyou were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my\nwork, it was an excellent plan, and anyhow it's no use talking\nfurther   we should only get up steam.\" He felt angry and bruised;\nhe was too proud to tempt her back, but he did not consider that\nshe had behaved badly, because where his compatriots were concerned\nhe had a generous mind.\n\n\"I suppose that there is nothing else; it's unpardonable of me to\nhave given you and your mother all this bother,\" said Miss Quested\nheavily, and frowned up at the tree beneath which they were sitting.\nA little green bird was observing her, so brilliant and neat that\nit might have hopped straight out of a shop. On catching her eye\nit closed its own, gave a small skip and prepared to go to bed.\nSome Indian wild bird. \"Yes, nothing else,\" she repeated, feeling\nthat a profound and passionate speech ought to have been delivered\nby one or both of them. \"We've been awfully British over it, but\nI suppose that's all right.\"\n\n\"As we are British, I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"Anyhow we've not quarrelled, Ronny.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would have been too absurd. Why should we quarrel?\"\n\n\"I think we shall keep friends.\"\n\n\"I know we shall.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\nAs soon as they had exchanged this admission, a wave of relief\npassed through them both, and then transformed itself into a wave\nof tenderness, and passed back. They were softened by their own\nhonesty, and began to feel lonely and unwise. Experiences, not\ncharacter, divided them; they were not dissimilar, as humans go;\nindeed, when compared with the people who stood nearest to them in\npoint of space they became practically identical. The Bhil who was\nholding an officer's polo pony, the Eurasian who drove the Nawab\nBahadur's car, the Nawab Bahadur himself, the Nawab Bahadur's\ndebauched grandson   none would have examined a difficulty so frankly\nand coolly. The mere fact of examination caused it to diminish. Of\ncourse they were friends, and for ever. \"Do you know what the name\nof that green bird up above us is?\" she asked, putting her shoulder\nrather nearer to his.\n\n\"Bee-eater.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Ronny, it has red bars on its wings.\"\n\n\"Parrot,\" he hazarded.\n\n\"Good gracious no.\"\n\nThe bird in question dived into the dome of the tree. It was of no\nimportance, yet they would have liked to identify it, it would\nsomehow have solaced their hearts.\n\nBut nothing in India is identifiable, the mere asking of a question\ncauses it to disappear or to merge in something else.\n\n\"McBryde has an illustrated bird book,\" he said dejectedly. \"I'm\nno good at all at birds, in fact I'm useless at any information\noutside my own job. It's a great pity.\"\n\n\"So am I. I'm useless at everything.\"\n\n\"What do I hear?\" shouted the Nawab Bahadur at the top of his\nvoice, causing both of them to start. \"What most improbable\nstatement have I heard? An English lady useless? No, no, no, no,\nno.\" He laughed genially, sure, within limits, of his welcome.\n\n\"Hallo, Nawab Bahadur! Been watching the polo again?\" said Ronny\ntepidly.\n\n\"I have, sahib, I have.\"\n\n\"How do you do?\" said Adela, likewise pulling herself together.\nShe held out her hand. The old gentleman judged from so wanton a\ngesture that she was new to his country, but he paid little heed.\nWomen who exposed their face became by that one act so mysterious\nto him that he took them at the valuation of their men folk rather\nthan at his own. Perhaps they were not immoral, and anyhow they\nwere not his affair. On seeing the City Magistrate alone with a\nmaiden at twilight, he had borne down on them with hospitable\nintent. He had a new little car, and wished to place it at their\ndisposal; the City Magistrate would decide whether the offer was\nacceptable.\n\nRonny was by this time rather ashamed of his curtness to Aziz and\nGodbole, and here was an opportunity of showing that he could treat\nIndians with consideration when they deserved it. So he said to\nAdela, with the same sad friendliness that he had employed when\ndiscussing the bird, \"Would half an hour's spin entertain you at\nall?\"\n\n\"Oughtn't we to get back to the bungalow.\"\n\n\"Why?\" He gazed at her.\n\n\"I think perhaps I ought to see your mother and discuss future\nplans.\"\n\n\"That's as you like, but there's no hurry, is there?\"\n\n\"Let me take you to the bungalow, and first the little spin,\" cried\nthe old man, and hastened to the car.\n\n\"He may show you some aspect of the country I can't, and he's a\nreal loyalist. I thought you might care for a bit of a change.\"\n\nDetermined to give him no more trouble, she agreed, but her desire\nto see India had suddenly decreased. There had been a factitious\nelement in it.\n\nHow should they seat themselves in the car? The elegant grandson\nhad to be left behind. The Nawab Bahadur got up in front, for he\nhad no intention of neighbouring an English girl. \"Despite my\nadvanced years, I am learning to drive,\" he said. \"Man can learn\neverything if he will but try.\" And foreseeing a further difficulty,\nhe added, \"I do not do the actual steering. I sit and ask my\nchauffeur questions, and thus learn the reason for everything that\nis done before I do it myself. By this method serious and I may\nsay ludicrous accidents, such as befell one of my compatriots\nduring that delightful reception at the English Club, are avoided.\nOur good Panna Lal! I hope, sahib, that great damage was not done\nto your flowers. Let us have our little spin down the Gangavati\nroad. Half one league onwards!\" He fell asleep.\n\nRonny instructed the chauffeur to take the Marabar road rather than\nthe Gangavati, since the latter was under repair, and settled\nhimself down beside the lady he had lost. The car made a burring\nnoise and rushed along a chauss  e that ran upon an embankment above\nmelancholy fields. Trees of a poor quality bordered the road,\nindeed the whole scene was inferior, and suggested that the\ncountry-side was too vast to admit of excellence. In vain did each\nitem in it call out, \"Come, come.\"\n\nThere was not enough god to go round. The two young people conversed\nfeebly and felt unimportant. When the darkness began, it seemed to\nwell out of the meagre vegetation, entirely covering the fields\neach side of them before it brimmed over the road. Ronny's face\ngrew dim   an event that always increased her esteem for his\ncharacter. Her hand touched his, owing to a jolt, and one of the\nthrills so frequent in the animal kingdom passed between them, and\nannounced that all their difficulties were only a lovers' quarrel.\nEach was too proud to increase the pressure, but neither withdrew\nit, and a spurious unity descended on them, as local and temporary\nas the gleam that inhabits a firefly. It would vanish in a moment,\nperhaps to reappear, but the darkness is alone durable. And the\nnight that encircled them, absolute as it seemed, was itself only\na spurious unity, being modified by the gleams of day that leaked\nup round the edges of the earth, and by the stars.\n\nThey gripped . . . bump, jump, a swerve, two wheels lifted in the\nair, breaks on, bump with tree at edge of embankment, standstill.\nAn accident. A slight one. Nobody hurt. The Nawab Bahadur awoke.\nHe cried out in Arabic, and violently tugged his beard.\n\n\"What's the damage?\" enquired Ronny, after the moment's pause that\nhe permitted himself before taking charge of a situation. The\nEurasian, inclined to be flustered, rallied to the sound of his\nvoice, and, every inch an Englishman, replied, \"You give me five\nminutes' time, I'll take you any dam anywhere.\"\n\n\"Frightened, Adela?\" He released her hand.\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"I consider not to be frightened the height of folly,\" cried the\nNawab Bahadur quite rudely.\n\n\"Well, it's all over now, tears are useless,\" said Ronny,\ndismounting. \"We had some luck butting that tree.\"\n\n\"All over . . . oh yes, the danger is past, let us smoke cigarettes,\nlet us do anything we please. Oh yes . . . enjoy ourselves   oh my\nmerciful God . . .\" His words died into Arabic again.\n\n\"Wasn't the bridge. We skidded.\"\n\n\"We didn't skid,\" said Adela, who had seen the cause of the\naccident, and thought everyone must have seen it too. \"We ran into\nan animal.\"\n\nA loud cry broke from the old man: his terror was disproportionate\nand ridiculous.\n\n\"An animal?\"\n\n\"A large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us.\"\n\n\"By Jove, she's right,\" Ronny exclaimed. \"The paint's gone.\"\n\n\"By Jove, sir, your lady is right,\" echoed the Eurasian. Just by\nthe hinges of the door was a dent, and the door opened with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"Of course I'm right. I saw its hairy back quite plainly.\"\n\n\"I say, Adela, what was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know the animals any better than the birds here   too big\nfor a goat.\"\n\n\"Exactly, too big for a goat . . .\" said the old man.\n\nRonny said, \"Let's go into this; let's look for its tracks.\"\n\n\"Exactly; you wish to borrow this electric torch.\"\n\nThe English people walked a few steps back into the darkness,\nunited and happy. Thanks to their youth and upbringing, they were\nnot upset by the accident. They traced back the writhing of the\ntyres to the source of their disturbance. It was just after the\nexit from a bridge; the animal had probably come up out of the\nnullah. Steady and smooth ran the marks of the car, ribbons neatly\nnicked with lozenges, then all went mad. Certainly some external\nforce had impinged, but the road had been used by too many objects\nfor any one track to be legible, and the torch created such high\nlights and black shadows that they could not interpret what it\nrevealed. Moreover, Adela in her excitement knelt and swept her\nskirts about, until it was she if anyone who appeared to have\nattacked the car. The incident was a great relief to them both.\nThey forgot their abortive personal relationship, and felt\nadventurous as they muddled about in the dust.\n\n\"I believe it was a buffalo,\" she called to their host, who had\nnot accompanied them.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Unless it was a hyena.\"\n\nRonny approved this last conjecture. Hyenas prowl in nullahs and\nheadlights dazzle them.\n\n\"Excellent, a hyena,\" said the Indian with an angry irony and a\ngesture at the night. \"Mr. Harris!\"\n\n\"Half a mo-ment. Give me ten minutes' time.\"\n\n\"Sahib says hyena.\"\n\n\"Don't worry Mr. Harris. He saved us from a nasty smash. Harris,\nwell done!\"\n\n\"A smash, sahib, that would not have taken place had he obeyed and\ntaken us Gangavati side, instead of Marabar.\"\n\n\"My fault that. I told him to come this way because the road's\nbetter. Mr. Lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills.\"\n\n\"Ah, now I begin to understand.\" Seeming to pull himself together,\nhe apologized slowly and elaborately for the accident. Ronny\nmurmured, \"Not at all,\" but apologies were his due, and should have\nstarted sooner: because English people are so calm at a crisis, it\nis not to be assumed that they are unimportant. The Nawab Bahadur\nhad not come out very well.\n\nAt that moment a large car approached from the opposite direction.\nRonny advanced a few steps down the road, and with authority in\nhis voice and gesture stopped it. It bore the inscription \"Mudkul\nState\" across its bonnet. All friskiness and friendliness, Miss\nDerek sat inside.\n\n\"Mr. Heaslop, Miss Quested, what are you holding up an innocent\nfemale for?\"\n\n\"We've had a breakdown.\"\n\n\"But how putrid!\"\n\n\"We ran into a hyena!\"\n\n\"How absolutely rotten!\"\n\n\"Can you give us a lift?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"Take me too,\" said the Nawab Bahadur.\n\n\"Heh, what about me?\" cried Mr. Harris.\n\n\"Now what's all this? I'm not an omnibus,\" said Miss Derek with\ndecision. \"I've a harmonium and two dogs in here with me as it is.\nI'll take three of you if one'll sit in front and nurse a pug. No\nmore.\"\n\n\"I will sit in front,\" said the Nawab Bahadur.\n\n\"Then hop in: I've no notion who you are.\"\n\n\"Heh no, what about my dinner? I can't be left alone all the\nnight.\" Trying to look and feel like a European, the chauffeur\ninterposed aggressively. He still wore a topi, despite the darkness,\nand his face, to which the Ruling Race had contributed little\nbeyond bad teeth, peered out of it pathetically, and seemed to say,\n\"What's it all about? Don't worry me so, you blacks and whites.\nHere I am, stuck in dam India same as you, and you got to fit me\nin better than this.\"\n\n\"Nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle,\"\nsaid the Nawab Bahadur, who had regained his usual dignity. \"I\nshall despatch him with all possible speed. Meanwhile, repair my\ncar.\"\n\nThey sped off, and Mr. Harris, after a reproachful glance, squatted\ndown upon his hams. When English and Indians were both present, he\ngrew self-conscious, because he did not know to whom he belonged.\nFor a little he was vexed by opposite currents in his blood, then\nthey blended, and he belonged to no one but himself.\n\nBut Miss Derek was in tearing spirits. She had succeeded in stealing\nthe Mudkul car. Her Maharajah would be awfully sick, but she didn't\nmind, he could sack her if he liked. \"I don't believe in these\npeople letting you down,\" she said. \"If I didn't snatch like the\ndevil, I should be nowhere. He doesn't want the car, silly fool!\nSurely it's to the credit of his State I should be seen about in\nit at Chandrapore during my leave. He ought to look at it that way.\nAnyhow he's got to look at it that way. My Maharani's different   my\nMaharani's a dear. That's her fox terrier, poor little devil. I\nfished them out both with the driver. Imagine taking dogs to a\nChiefs' Conference! As sensible as taking Chiefs, perhaps.\" She\nshrieked with laughter. \"The harmonium   the harmonium's my little\nmistake, I own. They rather had me over the harmonium. I meant it\nto stop on the train. Oh lor'!\"\n\nRonny laughed with restraint. He did not approve of English people\ntaking service under the Native States, where they obtain a certain\namount of influence, but at the expense of the general prestige.\nThe humorous triumphs of a free lance are of no assistance to an\nadministrator, and he told the young lady that she would outdo\nIndians at their own game if she went on much longer.\n\n\"They always sack me before that happens, and then I get another\njob. The whole of India seethes with Maharanis and Ranis and Begums\nwho clamour for such as me.\"\n\n\"Really. I had no idea.\"\n\n\"How could you have any idea, Mr. Heaslop? What should he know\nabout Maharanis, Miss Quested? Nothing. At least I should hope\nnot.\"\n\n\"I understand those big people are not particularly interesting,\"\nsaid Adela, quietly, disliking the young woman's tone. Her hand\ntouched Ronny's again in the darkness, and to the animal thrill\nthere was now added a coincidence of opinion.\n\n\"Ah, there you're wrong. They're priceless.\"\n\n\"I would scarcely call her wrong,\" broke out the Nawab Bahadur,\nfrom his isolation on the front seat, whither they had relegated\nhim. \"A Native State, a Hindu State, the wife of a ruler of a Hindu\nState, may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady, and let it not\nbe for a moment supposed that I suggest anything against the\ncharacter of Her Highness the Maharani of Mudkul. But I fear she\nwill be uneducated, I fear she will be superstitious. Indeed, how\ncould she be otherwise? What opportunity of education has such a\nlady had? Oh, superstition is terrible, terrible! oh, it is the\ngreat defect in our Indian character!\"   and as if to point his\ncriticism, the lights of the civil station appeared on a rise to\nthe right. He grew more and more voluble. \"Oh, it is the duty of\neach and every citizen to shake superstition off, and though I have\nlittle experience of Hindu States, and none of this particular one,\nnamely Mudkul (the Ruler, I fancy, has a salute of but eleven\nguns)   yet I cannot imagine that they have been as successful as\nBritish India, where we see reason and orderliness spreading in\nevery direction, like a most health-giving flood!\"\n\nMiss Derek said \"Golly!\"\n\nUndeterred by the expletive, the old man swept on. His tongue had\nbeen loosed and his mind had several points to make. He wanted to\nendorse Miss Quested's remark that big people are not interesting,\nbecause he was bigger himself than many an independent chief; at\nthe same time, he must neither remind nor inform her that he was\nbig, lest she felt she had committed a discourtesy. This was the\ngroundwork of his oration; worked in with it was his gratitude to\nMiss Derek for the lift, his willingness to hold a repulsive dog\nin his arms, and his general regret for the trouble he had caused\nthe human race during the evening. Also he wanted to be dropped\nnear the city to get hold of his cleaner, and to see what mischief\nhis grandson was up to. As he wove all these anxieties into a\nsingle rope, he suspected that his audience felt no interest, and\nthat the City Magistrate fondled either maiden behind the cover of\nthe harmonium, but good breeding compelled him to continue; it was\nnothing to him if they were bored, because he did not know what\nboredom is, and it was nothing to him if they were licentious,\nbecause God has created all races to be different. The accident\nwas over, and his life, equably useful, distinguished, happy, ran\non as before and expressed itself in streams of well-chosen words.\n\nWhen this old geyser left them, Ronny made no comment, but talked\nlightly about polo; Turton had taught him that it is sounder not\nto discuss a man at once, and he reserved what he had to say on\nthe Nawab's character until later in the evening. His hand, which\nhe had removed to say good-bye, touched Adela's again; she caressed\nit definitely, he responded, and their firm and mutual pressure\nsurely meant something. They looked at each other when they reached\nthe bungalow, for Mrs. Moore was inside it. It was for Miss Quested\nto speak, and she said nervously, \"Ronny, I should like to take\nback what I said on the Maidan.\" He assented, and they became\nengaged to be married in consequence.\n\nNeither had foreseen such a consequence. She had meant to revert\nto her former condition of important and cultivated uncertainty,\nbut it had passed out of her reach at its appropriate hour. Unlike\nthe green bird or the hairy animal, she was labelled now. She felt\nhumiliated again, for she deprecated labels, and she felt too that\nthere should have been another scene between her lover and herself\nat this point, something dramatic and lengthy. He was pleased\ninstead of distressed, he was surprised, but he had really nothing\nto say. What indeed is there to say? To be or not to be married,\nthat was the question, and they had decided it in the affirmative.\n\n\"Come along and let's tell the mater all this\"   opening the\nperforated zinc door that protected the bungalow from the swarms\nof winged creatures. The noise woke the mater up. She had been\ndreaming of the absent children who were so seldom mentioned, Ralph\nand Stella, and did not at first grasp what was required of her.\nShe too had become used to thoughtful procrastination, and felt\nalarmed when it came to an end.\n\nWhen the announcement was over, he made a gracious and honest\nremark. \"Look here, both of you, see India if you like and as you\nlike   I know I made myself rather ridiculous at Fielding's, but . . .\nit's different now. I wasn't quite sure of myself.\"\n\n\"My duties here are evidently finished, I don't want to see India\nnow; now for my passage back,\" was Mrs. Moore's thought. She\nreminded herself of all that a happy marriage means, and of her\nown happy marriages, one of which had produced Ronny. Adela's\nparents had also been happily married, and excellent it was to see\nthe incident repeated by the younger generation. On and on! the\nnumber of such unions would certainly increase as education spread\nand ideals grew loftier, and characters firmer. But she was tired\nby her visit to Government College, her feet ached, Mr. Fielding\nhad walked too fast and far, the young people had annoyed her in\nthe tum-tum, and given her to suppose they were breaking with each\nother, and though it was all right now she could not speak as\nenthusiastically of wedlock or of anything as she should have done.\nRonny was suited, now she must go home and help the others, if they\nwished. She was past marrying herself, even unhappily; her function\nwas to help others, her reward to be informed that she was\nsympathetic. Elderly ladies must not expect more than this.\n\nThey dined alone. There was much pleasant and affectionate talk\nabout the future. Later on they spoke of passing events, and Ronny\nreviewed and recounted the day from his own point of view. It was\na different day from the women's, because while they had enjoyed\nthemselves or thought, he had worked. Mohurram was approaching,\nand as usual the Chandrapore Mohammedans were building paper towers\nof a size too large to pass under the branches of a certain pepul\ntree. One knew what happened next; the tower stuck, a Mohammedan\nclimbed up the pepul and cut the branch off, the Hindus protested,\nthere was a religious riot, and Heaven knew what, with perhaps the\ntroops sent for. There had been deputations and conciliation\ncommittees under the auspices of Turton, and all the normal work\nof Chandrapore had been hung up. Should the procession take another\nroute, or should the towers be shorter? The Mohammedans offered\nthe former, the Hindus insisted on the latter. The Collector had\nfavoured the Hindus, until he suspected that they had artificially\nbent the tree nearer the ground. They said it sagged naturally.\nMeasurements, plans, an official visit to the spot. But Ronny had\nnot disliked his day, for it proved that the British were necessary\nto India; there would certainly have been bloodshed without them.\nHis voice grew complacent again; he was here not to be pleasant\nbut to keep the peace, and now that Adela had promised to be his\nwife, she was sure to understand.\n\n\"What does our old gentleman of the car think?\" she asked, and her\nnegligent tone was exactly what he desired.\n\n\"Our old gentleman is helpful and sound, as he always is over\npublic affairs. You've seen in him our show Indian.\"\n\n\"Have I really?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so. Incredible, aren't they, even the best of them?\nThey're all   they all forget their back collar studs sooner or\nlater. You've had to do with three sets of Indians to-day, the\nBhattacharyas, Aziz, and this chap, and it really isn't a\ncoincidence that they've all let you down.\"\n\n\"I like Aziz, Aziz is my real friend,\" Mrs. Moore interposed.\n\n\"When the animal runs into us the Nawab loses his head, deserts\nhis unfortunate chauffeur, intrudes upon Miss Derek . . . no great\ncrimes, no great crimes, but no white man would have done it.\"\n\n\"What animal?\"\n\n\"Oh, we had a small accident on the Marabar road. Adela thinks it\nwas a hyena.\"\n\n\"An accident?\" she cried.\n\n\"Nothing; no one hurt. Our excellent host awoke much rattled from\nhis dreams, appeared to think it was our fault, and chanted exactly,\nexactly.\"\n\nMrs. Moore shivered, \"A ghost!\" But the idea of a ghost scarcely\npassed her lips. The young people did not take it up, being occupied\nwith their own outlooks, and deprived of support it perished, or\nwas reabsorbed into the part of the mind that seldom speaks.\n\n\"Yes, nothing criminal,\" Ronny summed up, \"but there's the native,\nand there's one of the reasons why we don't admit him to our clubs,\nand how a decent girl like Miss Derek can take service under\nnatives puzzles me. . . . But I must get on with my work. Krishna!\"\nKrishna was the peon who should have brought the files from his\noffice. He had not turned up, and a terrific row ensued. Ronny\nstormed, shouted, howled, and only the experienced observer could\ntell that he was not angry, did not much want the files, and only\nmade a row because it was the custom. Servants, quite understanding,\nran slowly in circles, carrying hurricane lamps. Krishna the earth,\nKrishna the stars replied, until the Englishman was appeased by\ntheir echoes, fined the absent peon eight annas, and sat down to\nhis arrears in the next room.\n\n\"Will you play Patience with your future mother-in-law, dear Adela,\nor does it seem too tame?\"\n\n\"I should like to   I don't feel a bit excited   I'm just glad it's\nsettled up at last, but I'm not conscious of vast changes. We are\nall three the same people still.\"\n\n\"That's much the best feeling to have.\" She dealt out the first\nrow of  \"demon.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said the girl thoughtfully.\n\n\"I feared at Mr. Fielding's that it might be settled the other way\n. . . black knave on a red queen. . . .\" They chatted gently about\nthe game.\n\nPresently Adela said: \"You heard me tell Aziz and Godbole I wasn't\nstopping in their country. I didn't mean it, so why did I say it?\nI feel I haven't been   frank enough, attentive enough, or something.\nIt's as if I got everything out of proportion. You have been so\nvery good to me, and I meant to be good when I sailed, but somehow\nI haven't been. . . . Mrs. Moore, if one isn't absolutely honest,\nwhat is the use of existing?\"\n\nShe continued to lay out her cards. The words were obscure, but\nshe understood the uneasiness that produced them. She had\nexperienced it twice herself, during her own engagements   this vague\ncontrition and doubt. All had come right enough afterwards and\ndoubtless would this time   marriage makes most things right enough.\n\"I wouldn't worry,\" she said. \"It's partly the odd surroundings;\nyou and I keep on attending to trifles instead of what's important;\nwe are what the people here call    new.'\"\n\n\"You mean that my bothers are mixed up with India?\"\n\n\"India's      \" She stopped.\n\n\"What made you call it a ghost?\"\n\n\"Call what a ghost?\"\n\n\"The animal thing that hit us. Didn't you say    Oh, a ghost,' in\npassing.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have been thinking of what I was saying.\"\n\n\"It was probably a hyena, as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"Ah, very likely.\"\n\nAnd they went on with their Patience. Down in Chandrapore the Nawab\nBahadur waited for his car. He sat behind his town house (a small\nunfurnished building which he rarely entered) in the midst of the\nlittle court that always improvises itself round Indians of\nposition. As if turbans were the natural product of darkness a\nfresh one would occasionally froth to the front, incline itself\ntowards him, and retire. He was preoccupied, his diction was\nappropriate to a religious subject. Nine years previously, when\nfirst he had had a car, he had driven it over a drunken man and\nkilled him, and the man had been waiting for him ever since. The\nNawab Bahadur was innocent before God and the Law, he had paid\ndouble the compensation necessary; but it was no use, the man\ncontinued to wait in an unspeakable form, close to the scene of\nhis death. None of the English people knew of this, nor did the\nchauffeur; it was a racial secret communicable more by blood than\nspeech. He spoke now in horror of the particular circumstances; he\nhad led others into danger, he had risked the lives of two innocent\nand honoured guests. He repeated, \"If I had been killed, what\nmatter? it must happen sometime; but they who trusted me      \"\n\nThe company shuddered and invoked the mercy of God. Only Aziz held\naloof, because a personal experience restrained him: was it not by\ndespising ghosts that he had come to know Mrs. Moore? \"You know,\nNureddin,\" he whispered to the grandson   an effeminate youth whom\nhe seldom met, always liked, and invariably forgot   \"you know, my\ndear fellow, we Moslems simply must get rid of these superstitions,\nor India will never advance. How long must I hear of the savage\npig upon the Marabar Road?\" Nureddin looked down. Aziz continued:\n\"Your grandfather belongs to another generation, and I respect and\nlove the old gentleman, as you know. I say nothing against him,\nonly that it is wrong for us, because we are young. I want you to\npromise me   Nureddin, are you listening?   not to believe in Evil\nSpirits, and if I die (for my health grows very weak) to bring up\nmy three children to disbelieve in them too.\" Nureddin smiled, and\na suitable answer rose to his pretty lips, but before he could make\nit the car arrived, and his grandfather took him away.\n\nThe game of Patience up in the civil lines went on longer than\nthis. Mrs. Moore continued to murmur \"Red ten on a black knave,\"\nMiss Quested to assist her, and to intersperse among the intricacies\nof the play details about the hyena, the engagement, the Maharani\nof Mudkul, the Bhattacharyas, and the day generally, whose rough\ndesiccated surface acquired as it receded a definite outline, as\nIndia itself might, could it be viewed from the moon. Presently\nthe players went to bed, but not before other people had woken up\nelsewhere, people whose emotions they could not share, and whose\nexistence they ignored. Never tranquil, never perfectly dark, the\nnight wore itself away, distinguished from other nights by two or\nthree blasts of wind, which seemed to fall perpendicularly out of\nthe sky and to bounce back into it, hard and compact, leaving no\nfreshness behind them: the hot weather was approaching.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

Old Mr. Graysford and young Mr. Sorley made\nconverts during a famine, because they distributed food; but when\ntimes improved they were naturally left alone again, and though\nsurprised and aggrieved each time this happened, they never learnt\nwisdom. \"No Englishman understands us except Mr. Fielding,\" he\nthought; \"but how shall I see him again? If he entered this room\nthe disgrace of it would kill me.\" He called to Hassan to clear\nup, but Hassan, who was testing his wages by ringing them on the\nstep of the verandah, found it possible not to hear him; heard and\ndidn't hear, just as Aziz had called and hadn't called. \"That's\nIndia all over . . . how like us . . . there we are . . .\" He dozed\nagain, and his thoughts wandered over the varied surface of life.\n\nGradually they steadied upon a certain spot   the Bottomless Pit\naccording to missionaries, but he had never regarded it as more\nthan a dimple. Yes, he did want to spend an evening with some\ngirls, singing and all that, the vague jollity that would culminate\nin voluptuousness. Yes, that was what he did want. How could it be\nmanaged? If Major Callendar had been an Indian, he would have\nremembered what young men are, and granted two or three days' leave\nto Calcutta without asking questions. But the Major assumed either\nthat his subordinates were made of ice, or that they repaired to\nthe Chandrapore bazaars   disgusting ideas both. It was only Mr.\nFielding who      \n\n\"Hassan!\"\n\nThe servant came running.\n\n\"Look at those flies, brother;\" and he pointed to the horrible mass\nthat hung from the ceiling. The nucleus was a wire which had been\ninserted as a homage to electricity. Electricity had paid no\nattention, and a colony of eye-flies had come instead and blackened\nthe coils with their bodies.\n\n\"Huzoor, those are flies.\"\n\n\"Good, good, they are, excellent, but why have I called you?\"\n\n\"To drive them elsewhere,\" said Hassan, after painful thought.\n\n\"Driven elsewhere, they always return.\"\n\n\"Huzoor.\"\n\n\"You must make some arrangement against flies; that is why you are\nmy servant,\" said Aziz gently.\n\nHassan would call the little boy to borrow the step-ladder from\nMahmoud Ali's house; he would order the cook to light the Primus\nstove and heat water; he would personally ascend the steps with a\nbucket in his arms, and dip the end of the coil into it.\n\n\"Good, very good. Now what have you to do?\"\n\n\"Kill flies.\"\n\n\"Good. Do it.\"\n\nHassan withdrew, the plan almost lodged in his head, and began to\nlook for the little boy. Not finding him, his steps grew slower,\nand he stole back to his post on the verandah, but did not go on\ntesting his rupees, in case his master heard them clink. On\ntwittered the Sunday bells; the East had returned to the East via\nthe suburbs of England, and had become ridiculous during the\ndetour.\n\nAziz continued to think about beautiful women.\n\nHis mind here was hard and direct, though not brutal. He had learnt\nall he needed concerning his own constitution many years ago,\nthanks to the social order into which he had been born, and when\nhe came to study medicine he was repelled by the pedantry and fuss\nwith which Europe tabulates the facts of sex. Science seemed to\ndiscuss everything from the wrong end. It didn't interpret his\nexperiences when he found them in a German manual, because by being\nthere they ceased to be his experiences. What he had been told by\nhis father or mother or had picked up from servants   it was\ninformation of that sort that he found useful, and handed on as\noccasion offered to others.\n\nBut he must not bring any disgrace on his children by some silly\nescapade. Imagine if it got about that he was not respectable! His\nprofessional position too must be considered, whatever Major\nCallendar thought. Aziz upheld the proprieties, though he did not\ninvest them with any moral halo, and it was here that he chiefly\ndiffered from an Englishman. His conventions were social. There is\nno harm in deceiving society as long as she does not find you out,\nbecause it is only when she finds you out that you have harmed her;\nshe is not like a friend or God, who are injured by the mere\nexistence of unfaithfulness. Quite clear about this, he meditated\nwhat type of lie he should tell to get away to Calcutta, and had\nthought of a man there who could be trusted to send him a wire and\na letter that he could show to Major Callendar, when the noise of\nwheels was heard in his compound. Someone had called to enquire.\nThe thought of sympathy increased his fever, and with a sincere\ngroan he wrapped himself in his quilt.\n\n\"Aziz, my dear fellow, we are greatly concerned,\" said Hamidullah's\nvoice. One, two, three, four bumps, as people sat down upon his\nbed.\n\n\"When a doctor falls ill it is a serious matter,\" said the voice\nof Mr. Syed Mohammed, the assistant engineer.\n\n\"When an engineer falls ill, it is equally important,\" said the\nvoice of Mr. Haq, a police inspector.\n\n\"Oh yes, we are all jolly important, our salaries prove it.\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz took tea with our Principal last Thursday afternoon,\"\npiped Rafi, the engineer's nephew. \"Professor Godbole, who also\nattended, has sickened too, which seems rather a curious thing,\nsir, does it not?\"\n\nFlames of suspicion leapt up in the breast of each man.\n\n\"Humbug!\" exclaimed Hamidullah, in authoritative tones, quenching\nthem.\n\n\"Humbug, most certainly,\" echoed the others, ashamed of themselves.\nThe wicked schoolboy, having failed to start a scandal, lost\nconfidence and stood up with his back to the wall.\n\n\"Is Professor Godbole ill?\" enquired Aziz, penetrated by the news.\n\"I am sincerely sorry.\" Intelligent and compassionate, his face\npeeped out of the bright crimson folds of the quilt. \"How do you\ndo, Mr. Syed Mohammed, Mr. Haq? How very kind of you to enquire\nafter my health! How do you do, Hamidullah? But you bring me bad\nnews. What is wrong with him, the excellent fellow?\"\n\n\"Why don't you answer, Rafi? You're the great authority,\" said his\nuncle.\n\n\"Yes, Rafi's the great man,\" said Hamidullah, rubbing it in. \"Rafi\nis the Sherlock Holmes of Chandrapore. Speak up, Rafi.\"\n\nLess than the dust, the schoolboy murmured the word \"Diarrh  a,\"\nbut took courage as soon as it had been uttered, for it improved\nhis position. Flames of suspicion shot up again in the breasts of\nhis elders, though in a different direction. Could what was called\ndiarrh  a really be an early case of cholera?\n\n\"If this is so, this is a very serious thing: this is scarcely the\nend of March. Why have I not been informed?\" cried Aziz.\n\n\"Dr. Panna Lal attends him, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, both Hindus; there we have it; they hang together like\nflies and keep everything dark. Rafi, come here. Sit down. Tell me\nall the details. Is there vomiting also?\"\n\n\"Oh yes indeed, sir, and the serious pains.\"\n\n\"That settles it. In twenty-four hours he will be dead.\"\n\nEverybody looked and felt shocked, but Professor Godbole had\ndiminished his appeal by linking himself with a co-religionist. He\nmoved them less than when he had appeared as a suffering individual.\nBefore long they began to condemn him as a source of infection.\n\"All illness proceeds from Hindus,\" Mr. Haq said. Mr. Syed Mohammed\nhad visited religious fairs, at Allahabad and at Ujjain, and\ndescribed them with biting scorn. At Allahabad there was flowing\nwater, which carried impurities away, but at Ujjain the little\nriver Sipra was banked up, and thousands of bathers deposited their\ngerms in the pool. He spoke with disgust of the hot sun, the\ncow-dung and marigold flowers, and the encampment of saddhus, some\nof whom strode stark naked through the streets. Asked what was the\nname of the chief idol at Ujjain, he replied that he did not know,\nhe had disdained to enquire, he really could not waste his time\nover such trivialities. His outburst took some time, and in his\nexcitement he fell into Punjabi (he came from that side) and was\nunintelligible.\n\nAziz liked to hear his religion praised. It soothed the surface of\nhis mind, and allowed beautiful images to form beneath. When the\nengineer's noisy tirade was finished, he said, \"That is exactly my\nown view.\" He held up his hand, palm outward, his eyes began to\nglow, his heart to fill with tenderness. Issuing still farther from\nhis quilt, he recited a poem by Ghalib. It had no connection with\nanything that had gone before, but it came from his heart and spoke\nto theirs. They were overwhelmed by its pathos; pathos, they\nagreed, is the highest quality in art; a poem should touch the\nhearer with a sense of his own weakness, and should institute some\ncomparison between mankind and flowers. The squalid bedroom grew\nquiet; the silly intrigues, the gossip, the shallow discontent were\nstilled, while words accepted as immortal filled the indifferent\nair. Not as a call to battle, but as a calm assurance came the\nfeeling that India was one; Moslem; always had been; an assurance\nthat lasted until they looked out of the door. Whatever Ghalib had\nfelt, he had anyhow lived in India, and this consolidated it for\nthem: he had gone with his own tulips and roses, but tulips and\nroses do not go. And the sister kingdoms of the north   Arabia,\nPersia, Ferghana, Turkestan   stretched out their hands as he sang,\nsadly, because all beauty is sad, and greeted ridiculous Chandrapore,\nwhere every street and house was divided against itself, and told\nher that she was a continent and a unity.\n\nOf the company, only Hamidullah had any comprehension of poetry.\nThe minds of the others were inferior and rough. Yet they listened\nwith pleasure, because literature had not been divorced from their\ncivilization. The police inspector, for instance, did not feel that\nAziz had degraded himself by reciting, nor break into the cheery\nguffaw with which an Englishman averts the infection of beauty. He\njust sat with his mind empty, and when his thoughts, which were\nmainly ignoble, flowed back into it they had a pleasant freshness.\nThe poem had done no \"good\" to anyone, but it was a passing\nreminder, a breath from the divine lips of beauty, a nightingale\nbetween two worlds of dust. Less explicit than the call to Krishna,\nit voiced our loneliness nevertheless, our isolation, our need for\nthe Friend who never comes yet is not entirely disproved. Aziz it\nleft thinking about women again, but in a different way: less\ndefinite, more intense. Sometimes poetry had this effect on him,\nsometimes it only increased his local desires, and he never knew\nbeforehand which effect would ensue: he could discover no rule for\nthis or for anything else in life.\n\nHamidullah had called in on his way to a worrying committee of\nnotables, nationalist in tendency, where Hindus, Moslems, two\nSikhs, two Parsis, a Jain, and a Native Christian tried to like\none another more than came natural to them. As long as someone\nabused the English, all went well, but nothing constructive had\nbeen achieved, and if the English were to leave India, the committee\nwould vanish also. He was glad that Aziz, whom he loved and whose\nfamily was connected with his own, took no interest in politics,\nwhich ruin the character and career, yet nothing can be achieved\nwithout them. He thought of Cambridge   sadly, as of another poem\nthat had ended. How happy he had been there, twenty years ago!\nPolitics had not mattered in Mr. and Mrs. Bannister's rectory.\nThere, games, work, and pleasant society had interwoven, and\nappeared to be sufficient substructure for a national life. Here\nall was wire-pulling and fear. Messrs. Syed Mohammed and Haq   he\ncouldn't even trust them, although they had come in his carriage,\nand the schoolboy was a scorpion. Bending down, he said, \"Aziz,\nAziz, my dear boy, we must be going, we are already late. Get well\nquickly, for I do not know what our little circle would do without\nyou.\"\n\n\"I shall not forget those affectionate words,\" replied Aziz.\n\n\"Add mine to them,\" said the engineer.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Syed Mohammed, I will.\"\n\n\"And mine,\" \"And, sir, accept mine,\" cried the others, stirred each\naccording to his capacity towards goodwill. Little ineffectual\nunquenchable flames! The company continued to sit on the bed and\nto chew sugarcane, which Hassan had run for into the bazaar, and\nAziz drank a cup of spiced milk. Presently there was the sound of\nanother carriage. Dr. Panna Lal had arrived, driven by horrid Mr.\nRam Chand. The atmosphere of a sick-room was at once re-established,\nand the invalid retired under his quilt.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you will excuse, I have come to enquire by Major\nCallendar's orders,\" said the Hindu, nervous of the den of fanatics\ninto which his curiosity had called him.\n\n\"Here he lies,\" said Hamidullah, indicating the prostrate form.\n\n\"Dr. Aziz, Dr, Aziz, I come to enquire.\"\n\nAziz presented an expressionless face to the thermometer.\n\n\"Your hand also, please.\" He took it, gazed at the flies on the\nceiling, and finally announced \"Some temperature.\"\n\n\"I think not much,\" said Ram Chand, desirous of fomenting trouble.\n\n\"Some; he should remain in bed,\" repeated Dr. Panna Lal, and shook\nthe thermometer down, so that its altitude remained for ever\nunknown. He loathed his young colleague since the disasters with\nDapple, and he would have liked to do him a bad turn and report to\nMajor Callendar that he was shamming. But he might want a day in\nbed himself soon,   besides, though Major Callendar always believed\nthe worst of natives, he never believed them when they carried\ntales about one another. Sympathy seemed the safer course. \"How is\nstomach?\" he enquired, \"how head?\" And catching sight of the empty\ncup, he recommended a milk diet.\n\n\"This is a great relief to us, it is very good of you to call,\nDoctor Sahib,\" Said Hamidullah, buttering him up a bit.\n\n\"It is only my duty.\"\n\n\"We know how busy you are.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true.\"\n\n\"And how much illness there is in the city.\"\n\nThe doctor suspected a trap in this remark; if he admitted that\nthere was or was not illness, either statement might be used\nagainst him. \"There is always illness,\" he replied, \"and I am\nalways busy   it is a doctor's nature.\"\n\n\"He has not a minute, he is due double sharp at Government College\nnow,\" said Ram Chand.\n\n\"You attend Professor Godbole there perhaps?\"\n\nThe doctor looked professional and was silent.\n\n\"We hope his diarrh  a is ceasing.\"\n\n\"He progresses, but not from diarrh  a.\"\n\n\"We are in some anxiety over him   he and Dr. Aziz are great friends.\nIf you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful\nto you.\"\n\nAfter a cautious pause he said, \"H  morrhoids.\"\n\n\"And so much, my dear Rafi, for your cholera,\" hooted Aziz, unable\nto restrain himself.\n\n\"Cholera, cholera, what next, what now?\" cried the doctor, greatly\nfussed. \"Who spreads such untrue reports about my patients?\"\n\nHamidullah pointed to the culprit.\n\n\"I hear cholera, I hear bubonic plague, I hear every species of\nlie. Where will it end, I ask myself sometimes. This city is full\nof misstatements, and the originators of them ought to be discovered\nand punished authoritatively.\"\n\n\"Rafi, do you hear that? Now why do you stuff us up with all this\nhumbug?\"\n\nThe schoolboy murmured that another boy had told him, also that\nthe bad English grammar the Government obliged them to use often\ngave the wrong meaning for words, and so led scholars into mistakes.\n\n\"That is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor,\"\nsaid Ram Chand.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" agreed Hamidullah, anxious to avoid an\nunpleasantness. Quarrels spread so quickly and so far, and Messrs.\nSyed Mohammed and Haq looked cross, and ready to fly out. \"You must\napologize properly, Rafi, I can see your uncle wishes it,\" he said.\n\"You have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have\ncaused this gentleman by your carelessness.\"\n\n\"It is only a boy,\" said Dr. Panna Lal, appeased.\n\n\"Even boys must learn,\" said Ram Chand.\n\n\"Your own son failing to pass the lowest standard, I think,\" said\nSyed Mohammed suddenly.\n\n\"Oh, indeed? Oh yes, perhaps. He has not the advantage of a relative\nin the Prosperity Printing Press.\"\n\n\"Nor you the advantage of conducting their cases in the Courts any\nlonger.\"\n\nTheir voices rose. They attacked one another with obscure allusions\nand had a silly quarrel. Hamidullah and the doctor tried to make\npeace between them. In the midst of the din someone said, \"I say!\nIs he ill or isn't he ill?\" Mr. Fielding had entered unobserved.\nAll rose to their feet, and Hassan, to do an Englishman honour,\nstruck with a sugar-cane at the coil of flies.\n\nAziz said, \"Sit down,\" coldly. What a room! What a meeting! Squalor\nand ugly talk, the floor strewn with fragments of cane and nuts,\nand spotted with ink, the pictures crooked upon the dirty walls,\nno punkah! He hadn't meant to live like this or among these\nthird-rate people. And in his confusion he thought only of the\ninsignificant Rafi, whom he had laughed at, and allowed to be\nteased. The boy must be sent away happy, or hospitality would have\nfailed, along the whole line.\n\n\"It is good of Mr. Fielding to condescend to visit our friend,\"\nsaid the police inspector. \"We are touched by this great kindness.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to him like that, he doesn't want it, and he doesn't\nwant three chairs; he's not three Englishmen,\" he flashed. \"Rafi,\ncome here. Sit down again. I'm delighted you could come with Mr.\nHamidullah, my dear boy; it will help me to recover, seeing you.\"\n\n\"Forgive my mistakes,\" said Rafi, to consolidate himself.\n\n\"Well, are you ill, Aziz, or aren't you?\" Fielding repeated.\n\n\"No doubt Major Callendar has told you that I am shamming.\"\n\n\"Well, are you?\" The company laughed, friendly and pleased. \"An\nEnglishman at his best,\" they thought; \"so genial.\"\n\n\"Enquire from Dr. Panna Lal.\"\n\n\"You're sure I don't tire you by stopping?\"\n\n\"Why, no! There are six people present in my small room already.\nPlease remain seated, if you will excuse the informality.\" He\nturned away and continued to address Rafi, who was terrified at\nthe arrival of his Principal, remembered that he had tried to\nspread slander about him, and yearned to get away.\n\n\"He is ill and he is not ill,\" said Hamidullah, offering a\ncigarette. \"And I suppose that most of us are in that same case.\"\n\nFielding agreed; he and the pleasant sensitive barrister got on\nwell. They were fairly intimate and beginning to trust each other.\n\n\"The whole world looks to be dying, still it doesn't die, so we\nmust assume the existence of a beneficent Providence.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is true, how true!\" said the policeman, thinking religion\nhad been praised.\n\n\"Does Mr. Fielding think it's true?.\"\n\n\"Think which true? The world isn't dying. I'm certain of that!\"\n\n\"No, no   the existence of Providence.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't believe in Providence.\"\n\n\"But how then can you believe in God?\" asked Syed Mohammed.\n\n\"I don't believe in God.\"\n\nA tiny movement as of \"I told you so!\" passed round the company,\nand Aziz looked up for an instant, scandalized. \"Is it correct that\nmost are atheists in England now?\" Hamidullah enquired.\n\n\"The educated thoughtful people? I should say so, though they don't\nlike the name. The truth is that the West doesn't bother much over\nbelief and disbelief in these days. Fifty years ago, or even when\nyou and I were young, much more fuss was made.\"\n\n\"And does not morality also decline?\"\n\n\"It depends what you call   yes, yes, I suppose morality does\ndecline.\"\n\n\"Excuse the question, but if this is the case, how is England\njustified in holding India?\"\n\nThere they were! Politics again. \"It's a question I can't get my\nmind on to,\" he replied. \"I'm out here personally because I needed\na job. I cannot tell you why England is here or whether she ought\nto be here. It's beyond me.\"\n\n\"Well-qualified Indians also need jobs in the educational.\"\n\n\"I guess they do; I got in first,\" said Fielding, smiling.\n\n\"Then excuse me again   is it fair an Englishman should occupy one\nwhen Indians are available? Of course I mean nothing personally.\nPersonally we are delighted you should be here, and we benefit\ngreatly by this frank talk.\"\n\nThere is only one answer to a conversation of this type: \"England\nholds India for her good.\" Yet Fielding was disinclined to give\nit. The zeal for honesty had eaten him up. He said, \"I'm delighted\nto be here too   that's my answer, there's my only excuse. I can't\ntell you anything about fairness. It mayn't have been fair I should\nhave been born. I take up some other fellow's air, don't I, whenever\nI breathe? Still, I'm glad it's happened, and I'm glad I'm out\nhere. However big a badmash one is   if one's happy in consequence,\nthat is some justification.\"\n\nThe Indians were bewildered. The line of thought was not alien to\nthem, but the words were too definite and bleak. Unless a sentence\npaid a few compliments to Justice and Morality in passing, its\ngrammar wounded their ears and paralysed their minds. What they\nsaid and what they felt were (except in the case of affection)\nseldom the same. They had numerous mental conventions and when\nthese were flouted they found it very difficult to function.\nHamidullah bore up best. \"And those Englishmen who are not delighted\nto be in India   have they no excuse?\" he asked.\n\n\"None. Chuck 'em out.\"\n\n\"It may be difficult to separate them from the rest,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Worse than difficult, wrong,\" said Mr. Ram Chand. \"No Indian\ngentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing. Here we differ\nfrom those other nations. We are so spiritual.\"\n\n\"Oh that is true, how true!\" said the police inspector.\n\n\"Is it true, Mr. Haq? I don't consider us spiritual. We can't\nco-ordinate, we can't co-ordinate, it only comes to that. We can't\nkeep engagements, we can't catch trains. What more than this is\nthe so-called spirituality of India? You and I ought to be at the\nCommittee of Notables, we're not; our friend Dr. Lal ought to be\nwith his patients, he isn't. So we go on, and so we shall continue\nto go, I think, until the end of time.\"\n\n\"It is not the end of time, it is scarcely ten-thirty, ha, ha!\"\ncried Dr. Panna Lal, who was again in confident mood. \"Gentlemen,\nif I may be allowed to say a few words, what an interesting talk,\nalso thankfulness and gratitude to Mr. Fielding in the first place\nteaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his\nexperience and judgment      \"\n\n\"Dr. Lal!\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz?\"\n\n\"You sit on my leg.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon, but some might say your leg kicks.\"\n\n\"Come along, we tire the invalid in either case,\" said Fielding,\nand they filed out   four Mohammedans, two Hindus and the Englishman.\nThey stood on the verandah while their conveyances were summoned\nout of various patches of shade.\n\n\"Aziz has a high opinion of you, he only did not speak because of\nhis illness.\"\n\n\"I quite understand,\" said Fielding, who was rather disappointed\nwith his call. The Club comment, \"making himself cheap as usual,\"\npassed through his mind. He couldn't even get his horse brought\nup. He had liked Aziz so much at their first meeting, and had hoped\nfor developments.\n\n",

He started to get it himself, but\nwas stopped by a call from the house. Aziz was sitting up in bed,\nlooking dishevelled and sad. \"Here's your home,\" he said\nsardonically. \"Here's the celebrated hospitality of the East. Look\nat the flies. Look at the chunam coming off the walls. Isn't it\njolly? Now I suppose you want to be off, having seen an Oriental\ninterior.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, you want to rest.\"\n\n\"I can rest the whole day, thanks to worthy Dr. Lal. Major\nCallendar's spy, I suppose you know, but this time it didn't work.\nI am allowed to have a slight temperature.\"\n\n\"Callendar doesn't trust anyone, English or Indian: that's his\ncharacter, and I wish you weren't under him; but you are, and\nthat's that.\"\n\n\"Before you go, for you are evidently in a great hurry, will you\nplease unlock that drawer? Do you see a piece of brown paper at\nthe top?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\n\"Who is this?\"\n\n\"She was my wife. You are the first Englishman she has ever come\nbefore. Now put her photograph away.\"\n\nHe was astonished, as a traveller who suddenly sees, between the\nstones of the desert, flowers. The flowers have been there all the\ntime, but suddenly he sees them. He tried to look at the photograph,\nbut in itself it was just a woman in a sari, facing the world. He\nmuttered, \"Really, I don't know why you pay me this great\ncompliment, Aziz, but I do appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, she was not a highly educated woman or even\nbeautiful, but put it away. You would have seen her, so why should\nyou not see her photograph?\"\n\n\"You would have allowed me to see her?\"\n\n\"Why not? I believe in the purdah, but I should have told her you\nwere my brother, and she would have seen you. Hamidullah saw her,\nand several others.\"\n\n\"Did she think they were your brothers?\"\n\n\"Of course not, but the word exists and is convenient. All men are\nmy brothers, and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my\nwife.\"\n\n\"And when the whole world behaves as such, there will be no more\npurdah?\"\n\n\"It is because you can say and feel such a remark as that, that I\nshow you the photograph,\" said Aziz gravely.\n\n\"It is beyond the power of most men. It is because you behave well\nwhile I behave badly that I show it you. I never expected you to\ncome back just now when I called you. I thought,    He has certainly\ndone with me; I have insulted him.' Mr. Fielding, no one can ever\nrealize how much kindness we Indians need, we do not even realize\nit ourselves. But we know when it has been given. We do not forget,\nthough we may seem to. Kindness, more kindness, and even after that\nmore kindness. I assure you it is the only hope.\" His voice seemed\nto arise from a dream. Altering it, yet still deep below his normal\nsurface, he said, \"We can't build up India except on what we feel.\nWhat is the use of all these reforms, and Conciliation Committees\nfor Mohurram, and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry\nit another route, and Councils of Notables and official parties\nwhere the English sneer at our skins?\"\n\n\"It's beginning at the wrong end, isn't it? I know, but institutions\nand the governments don't.\" He looked again at the photograph. The\nlady faced the world at her husband's wish and her own, but how\nbewildering she found it, the echoing contradictory world!\n\n\"Put her away, she is of no importance, she is dead,\" said Aziz\ngently. \"I showed her to you because I have nothing else to show.\nYou may look round the whole of my bungalow now, and empty\neverything. I have no other secrets, my three children live away\nwith their grandmamma, and that is all.\"\n\nFielding sat down by the bed, flattered at the trust reposed in\nhim, yet rather sad. He felt old. He wished that he too could be\ncarried away on waves of emotion. The next time they met, Aziz\nmight be cautious and standoffish. He realized this, and it made\nhim sad that he should realize it. Kindness, kindness, and more\nkindness   yes, that he might supply, but was that really all that\nthe queer nation needed? Did it not also demand an occasional\nintoxication of the blood? What had he done to deserve this outburst\nof confidence, and what hostage could he give in exchange? He\nlooked back at his own life. What a poor crop of secrets it had\nproduced! There were things in it that he had shown to no one, but\nthey were so uninteresting, it wasn't worth while lifting a purdah\non their account. He'd been in love, engaged to be married, lady\nbroke it off, memories of her and thoughts about her had kept him\nfrom other women for a time; then indulgence, followed by repentance\nand equilibrium. Meagre really except the equilibrium, and Aziz\ndidn't want to have that confided to him   he would have called it\n\"everything ranged coldly on shelves.\"\n\n\"I shall not really be intimate with this fellow,\" Fielding thought,\nand then \"nor with anyone.\" That was the corollary. And he had to\nconfess that he really didn't mind, that he was content to help\npeople, and like them as long as they didn't object, and if they\nobjected pass on serenely. Experience can do much, and all that he\nhad learnt in England and Europe was an assistance to him, and\nhelped him towards clarity, but clarity prevented him from\nexperiencing something else.\n\n\"How did you like the two ladies you met last Thursday?\" he asked.\n\nAziz shook his head distastefully. The question reminded him of\nhis rash remark about the Marabar Caves.\n\n\"How do you like Englishwomen generally?\"\n\n\"Hamidullah liked them in England. Here we never look at them. Oh\nno, much too careful. Let's talk of something else.\"\n\n\"Hamidullah's right: they are much nicer in England. There's\nsomething that doesn't suit them out here.\"\n\nAziz after another silence said, \"Why are you not married?\"\n\nFielding was pleased that he had asked. \"Because I have more or\nless come through without it,\" he replied.\n\n\"I was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if\nI can make it interesting enough. The lady I liked wouldn't marry\nme   that is the main point, but that's fifteen years ago and now\nmeans nothing.\"\n\n\"But you haven't children.\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Excuse the following question: have you any illegitimate children?\"\n\n\"No. I'd willingly tell you if I had.\"\n\n\"Then your name will entirely die out.\"\n\n\"It must.\"\n\n\"Well.\" He shook his head. \"This indifference is what the Oriental\nwill never understand.\"\n\n\"I don't care for children.\"\n\n\"Caring has nothing to do with it,\" he said impatiently.\n\n\"I don't feel their absence, I don't want them weeping around my\ndeath-bed and being polite about me afterwards, which I believe is\nthe general notion. I'd far rather leave a thought behind me than\na child. Other people can have children. No obligation, with\nEngland getting so chock-a-block and overrunning India for jobs.\"\n\n\"Why don't you marry Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"Good God! why, the girl's a prig.\"\n\n\"Prig, prig? Kindly explain. Isn't that a bad word?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know her, but she struck me as one of the more pathetic\nproducts of Western education. She depresses me.\"\n\n\"But prig, Mr. Fielding? How's that?\"\n\n\"She goes on and on as if she's at a lecture   trying ever so hard\nto understand India and life, and occasionally taking a note.\"\n\n\"I thought her so nice and sincere.\"\n\n\"So she probably is,\" said Fielding, ashamed of his roughness: any\nsuggestion that he should marry always does produce overstatements\non the part of the bachelor, and a mental breeze. \"But I can't\nmarry her if I wanted to, for she has just become engaged to the\nCity Magistrate.\"\n\n\"Has she indeed? I am so glad!\" he exclaimed with relief, for this\nexempted him from the Marabar expedition: he would scarcely be\nexpected to entertain regular Anglo-Indians.\n\n\"It's the old mother's doing. She was afraid her dear boy would\nchoose for himself, so she brought out the girl on purpose, and\nflung them together until it happened.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Moore did not mention that to me among her plans.\"\n\n\"I may have got it wrong   I'm out of club gossip. But anyhow they're\nengaged to be married.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're out of it, my poor chap,\" he smiled. \"No Miss Quested\nfor Mr. Fielding. However, she was not beautiful. She has\npractically no breasts, if you come to think of it.\"\n\nHe smiled too, but found a touch of bad taste in the reference to\na lady's breasts.\n\n\"For the City Magistrate they shall be sufficient perhaps, and he\nfor her. For you I shall arrange a lady with breasts like mangoes.\n. . .\"\n\n\"No, you won't.\"\n\n\"I will not really, and besides your position makes it dangerous\nfor you.\" His mind had slipped from matrimony to Calcutta. His face\ngrew grave. Fancy if he had persuaded the Principal to accompany\nhim there, and then got him into trouble! And abruptly he took up\na new attitude towards his friend, the attitude of the protector\nwho knows the dangers of India and is admonitory. \"You can't be\ntoo careful in every way, Mr. Fielding; whatever you say or do in\nthis damned country there is always some envious fellow on the\nlook-out. You may be surprised to know that there were at least\nthree spies sitting here when you came to enquire. I was really a\ngood deal upset that you talked in that fashion about God. They\nwill certainly report it.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"That's all very well, but you spoke against morality also, and\nyou said you had come to take other people's jobs. All that was\nvery unwise. This is an awful place for scandal. Why, actually one\nof your own pupils was listening.\"\n\n\"Thanks for telling me that; yes, I must try and be more careful.\nIf I'm interested, I'm apt to forget myself. Still, it doesn't do\nreal harm.\"\n\n\"But speaking out may get you into trouble.\"\n\n\"It's often done so in the past.\"\n\n\"There, listen to that! But the end of it might be that you lost\nyour job.\"\n\n\"If I do, I do. I shall survive it. I travel light.\"\n\n\"Travel light! You are a most extraordinary race,\" said Aziz,\nturning away as if he were going to sleep, and immediately turning\nback again. \"Is it your climate, or what?\"\n\n\"Plenty of Indians travel light too   saddhus and such. It's one of\nthe things I admire about your country. Any man can travel light\nuntil he has a wife or children. That's part of my case against\nmarriage. I'm a holy man minus the holiness. Hand that on to your\nthree spies, and tell them to put it in their pipes.\"\n\nAziz was charmed and interested, and turned the new idea over in\nhis mind. So this was why Mr. Fielding and a few others were so\nfearless! They had nothing to lose. But he himself was rooted in\nsociety and Islam. He belonged to a tradition which bound him, and\nhe had brought children into the world, the society of the future.\nThough he lived so vaguely in this flimsy bungalow, nevertheless\nhe was placed, placed.\n\n\"I can't be sacked from my job, because my job's Education. I\nbelieve in teaching people to be individuals, and to understand\nother individuals. It's the only thing I do believe in. At\nGovernment College, I mix it up with trigonometry, and so on. When\nI'm a saddhu, I shall mix it up with something else.\"\n\nHe concluded his manifesto, and both were silent. The eye-flies\nbecame worse than ever and danced close up to their pupils, or\ncrawled into their ears. Fielding hit about wildly. The exercise\nmade him hot, and he got up to go.\n\n\"You might tell your servant to bring my horse. He doesn't seem to\nappreciate my Urdu.\"\n\n\"I know. I gave him orders not to. Such are the tricks we play on\nunfortunate Englishmen. Poor Mr. Fielding! But I will release you\nnow. Oh dear! With the exception of yourself and Hamidullah, I have\nno one to talk to in this place. You like Hamidullah, don't you?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Do you promise to come at once to us when you are in trouble?\"\n\n\"I never can be in trouble.\"\n\n\"There goes a queer chap, I trust he won't come to grief,\" thought\nAziz, left alone. His period of admiration was over, and he reacted\ntowards patronage. It was difficult for him to remain in awe of\nanyone who played with all his cards on the table. Fielding, he\ndiscovered on closer acquaintance, was truly warm-hearted and\nunconventional, but not what can be called wise. That frankness of\nspeech in the presence of Ram Chand, Rafi and Co. was dangerous\nand inelegant. It served no useful end.\n\nBut they were friends, brothers. That part was settled, their\ncompact had been subscribed by the photograph, they trusted one\nanother, affection had triumphed for once in a way. He dropped off\nto sleep amid the happier memories of the last two hours   poetry of\nGhalib, female grace, good old Hamidullah, good Fielding, his\nhonoured wife and dear boys. He passed into a region where these\njoys had no enemies but bloomed harmoniously in an eternal garden,\nor ran down watershoots of ribbed marble, or rose into domes\nwhereunder were inscribed, black against white, the ninety-nine\nattributes of God.\n\n\n\n\n  PART II: CAVES\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XIII\n\n\nThese hills look romantic in certain lights and at suitable\ndistances, and seen of an evening from the upper verandah of the\nclub they caused Miss Quested to say conversationally to Miss Derek\nthat she should like to have gone, that Dr. Aziz at Mr. Fielding's\nhad said he would arrange something, and that Indians seem rather\nforgetful. She was overheard by the servant who offered them\nvermouths. This servant understood English. And he was not exactly\na spy, but he kept his ears open, and Mahmoud Ali did not exactly\nbribe him, but did encourage him to come and squat with his own\nservants, and would happen to stroll their way when he was there.\nAs the story travelled, it accreted emotion and Aziz learnt with\nhorror that the ladies were deeply offended with him, and had\nexpected an invitation daily. He thought his facile remark had been\nforgotten. Endowed with two memories, a temporary and a permanent,\nhe had hitherto relegated the caves to the former. Now he\ntransferred them once for all, and pushed the matter through. They\nwere to be a stupendous replica of the tea party. He began by\nsecuring Fielding and old Godbole, and then commissioned Fielding\nto approach Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested when they were alone   by\nthis device Ronny, their official protector, could be circumvented.\nFielding didn't like the job much; he was busy, caves bored him,\nhe foresaw friction and expense, but he would not refuse the first\nfavour his friend had asked from him, and did as required. The\nladies accepted. It was a little inconvenient in the present press\nof their engagements, still, they hoped to manage it after\nconsulting Mr. Heaslop. Consulted, Ronny raised no objection,\nprovided Fielding undertook full responsibility for their comfort.\nHe was not enthusiastic about the picnic, but, then, no more were\nthe ladies   no one was enthusiastic, yet it took place.\n\nAziz was terribly worried. It was not a long expedition   a train\nleft Chandrapore just before dawn, another would bring them back\nfor tiffin   but he was only a little official still, and feared to\nacquit himself dishonourably. He had to ask Major Callendar for\nhalf a day's leave, and be refused because of his recent malingering;\ndespair; renewed approach of Major Callendar through Fielding, and\ncontemptuous snarling permission. He had to borrow cutlery from\nMahmoud Ali without inviting him. Then there was the question of\nalcohol; Mr. Fielding, and perhaps the ladies, were drinkers, so\nmust he provide whisky-sodas and ports? There was the problem of\ntransport from the wayside station of Marabar to the caves. There\nwas the problem of Professor Godbole and his food, and of Professor\nGodbole and other people's food   two problems, not one problem. The\nProfessor was not a very strict Hindu   he would take tea, fruit,\nsoda-water and sweets, whoever cooked them, and vegetables and rice\nif cooked by a Brahman; but not meat, not cakes lest they contained\neggs, and he would not allow anyone else to eat beef: a slice of\nbeef upon a distant plate would wreck his happiness. Other people\nmight eat mutton, they might eat ham. But over ham Aziz' own\nreligion raised its voice: he did not fancy other people eating\nham. Trouble after trouble encountered him, because he had\nchallenged the spirit of the Indian earth, which tries to keep men\nin compartments.\n\nAt last the moment arrived.\n\nHis friends thought him most unwise to mix himself up with English\nladies, and warned him to take every precaution against\nunpunctuality. Consequently he spent the previous night at the\nstation. The servants were huddled on the platform, enjoined not\nto stray. He himself walked up and down with old Mohammed Latif,\nwho was to act as major-domo. He felt insecure and also unreal. A\ncar drove up, and he hoped Fielding would get out of it, to lend\nhim solidity. But it contained Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested, and their\nGoanese servant. He rushed to meet them, suddenly happy. \"But\nyou've come, after all. Oh how very very kind of you!\" he cried.\n\"This is the happiest moment in all my life.\"\n\nThe ladies were civil. It was not the happiest moment in their\nlives, still, they looked forward to enjoying themselves as soon\nas the bother of the early start was over. They had not seen him\nsince the expedition was arranged, and they thanked him adequately.\n\n\"You don't require tickets   please stop your servant. There are no\ntickets on the Marabar branch line; it is its peculiarity. You come\nto the carriage and rest till Mr. Fielding joins us. Did you know\nyou are to travel purdah? Will you like that?\"\n\nThey replied that they should like it. The train had come in, and\na crowd of dependents were swarming over the seats of the carriage\nlike monkeys. Aziz had borrowed servants from his friends, as well\nas bringing his own three, and quarrels over precedence were\nresulting. The ladies' servant stood apart, with a sneering\nexpression on his face. They had hired him while they were still\nglobe-trotters, at Bombay. In a hotel or among smart people he was\nexcellent, but as soon as they consorted with anyone whom he\nthought second-rate he left them to their disgrace.\n\nThe night was still dark, but had acquired the temporary look that\nindicates its end. Perched on the roof of a shed, the station-master's\nhens began to dream of kites instead of owls. Lamps were put out,\nin order to save the trouble of putting them out later; the smell\nof tobacco and the sound of spitting arose from third-class\npassengers in dark corners; heads were unshrouded, teeth cleaned\non the twigs of a tree. So convinced was a junior official that\nanother sun would rise, that he rang a bell with enthusiasm. This\nupset the servants. They shrieked that the train was starting, and\nran to both ends of it to intercede. Much had still to enter the\npurdah carriage   a box bound with brass, a melon wearing a fez, a\ntowel containing guavas, a step-ladder and a gun. The guests played\nup all right. They had no race-consciousness   Mrs. Moore was too\nold, Miss Quested too new   and they behaved to Aziz as to any young\nman who had been kind to them in the country. This moved him\ndeeply. He had expected them to arrive with Mr. Fielding, instead\nof which they trusted themselves to be with him a few moments\nalone.\n\n\"Send back your servant,\" he suggested. \"He is unnecessary. Then\nwe shall all be Moslems together.\"\n\n\"And he is such a horrible servant. Antony, you can go; we don't\nwant you,\" said the girl impatiently.\n\n\"Master told me to come.\"\n\n\"Mistress tells you to go.\"\n\n\"Master says, keep near the ladies all the morning.\"\n\n\"Well, your ladies won't have you.\" She turned to the host. \"Do\nget rid of him, Dr. Aziz!\"\n\n\"Mohammed Latif!\" he called.\n\nThe poor relative exchanged fezzes with the melon, and peeped out\nof the window of the railway carriage, whose confusion he was\nsuperintending.\n\n\"Here is my cousin, Mr. Mohammed Latif. Oh no, don't shake hands.\nHe is an Indian of the old-fashioned sort, he prefers to salaam.\nThere, I told you so. Mohammed Latif, how beautifully you salaam.\nSee, he hasn't understood; he knows no English.\"\n\n\"You spick lie,\" said the old man gently.\n\n\"I spick a lie! Oh, jolly good. Isn't he a funny old man? We will\nhave great jokes with him later. He does all sorts of little\nthings. He is not nearly as stupid as you think, and awfully poor.\nIt's lucky ours is a large family.\" He flung an arm round the\ngrubby neck. \"But you get inside, make yourselves at home; yes,\nyou lie down.\" The celebrated Oriental confusion appeared at last\nto be at an end. \"Excuse me, now I must meet our other two guests!\"\n\nHe was getting nervous again, for it was ten minutes to the time.\nStill, Fielding was an Englishman, and they never do miss trains,\nand Godbole was a Hindu and did not count, and, soothed by this\nlogic, he grew calmer as the hour of departure approached. Mohammed\nLatif had bribed Antony not to come. They walked up and down the\nplatform, talking usefully. They agreed that they had overdone the\nservants, and must leave two or three behind at Marabar station.\nAnd Aziz explained that he might be playing one or two practical\njokes at the caves   not out of unkindness, but to make the guests\nlaugh. The old man assented with slight sideway motions of the\nhead: he was always willing to be ridiculed, and he bade Aziz not\nspare him. Elated by his importance, he began an indecent anecdote.\n\n\"Tell me another time, brother, when I have more leisure, for now,\nas I have already explained, we have to give pleasure to non-Moslems.\nThree will be Europeans, one a Hindu, which must not be forgotten.\nEvery attention must be paid to Professor Godbole, lest he feel\nthat he is inferior to my other guests.\"\n\n\"I will discuss philosophy with him.\"\n\n\"That will be kind of you; but the servants are even more important.\nWe must not convey an impression of disorganization. It can be\ndone, and I expect you to do it . . .\"\n\nA shriek from the purdah carriage. The train had started.\n\n\"Merciful God!\" cried Mohammed Latif. He flung himself at the\ntrain, and leapt on to the footboard of a carriage. Aziz did\nlikewise. It was an easy feat, for a branch-line train is slow to\nassume special airs. \"We're monkeys, don't worry,\" he called,\nhanging on to a bar and laughing. Then he howled, \"Mr. Fielding!\nMr. Fielding!\"\n\nThere were Fielding and old Godbole, held up at the level-crossing.\nAppalling catastrophe! The gates had been closed earlier than\nusual. They leapt from their tonga; they gesticulated, but what\nwas the good. So near and yet so far! As the train joggled past\nover the points, there was time for agonized words.\n\n\"Bad, bad, you have destroyed me.\"\n\n\"Godbole's pujah did it,\" cried the Englishman.\n\nThe Brahman lowered his eyes, ashamed of religion. For it was so:\nhe had miscalculated the length of a prayer.\n\n\"Jump on, I must have you,\" screamed Aziz, beside himself.\n\n\"Right, give a hand.\"\n\n\"He's not to, he'll kill himself,\" Mrs. Moore protested. He jumped,\nhe failed, missed his friend's hand, and fell back on to the line.\nThe train rumbled past. He scrambled on to his feet, and bawled\nafter them, \"I'm all right, you're all right, don't worry,\" and\nthen they passed beyond range of his voice.\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, Miss Quested, our expedition is a ruin.\" He swung\nhimself along the footboard, almost in tears.\n\n\"Get in, get in; you'll kill yourself as well as Mr. Fielding. I\nsee no ruin.\"\n\n\"How is that? Oh, explain to me!\" he said piteously, like a child.\n\n\"We shall be all Moslems together now, as you promised.\"\n\nShe was perfect as always, his dear Mrs. Moore. All the love for\nher he had felt at the mosque welled up again, the fresher for\nforgetfulness. There was nothing he would not do for her. He would\ndie to make her happy.\n\n\"Get in, Dr. Aziz, you make us giddy,\" the other lady called. \"If\nthey're so foolish as to miss the train, that's their loss, not\nours.\"\n\n\"I am to blame. I am the host.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, go to your carriage. We're going to have a delightful\ntime without them.\"\n\nNot perfect like Mrs. Moore, but very sincere and kind. Wonderful\nladies, both of them, and for one precious morning his guests. He\nfelt important and competent. Fielding was a loss personally, being\na friend, increasingly dear, yet if Fielding had come, he himself\nwould have remained in leading-strings. \"Indians are incapable of\nresponsibility,\" said the officials, and Hamidullah sometimes said\nso too. He would show those pessimists that they were wrong.\nSmiling proudly, he glanced outward at the country, which was still\ninvisible except as a dark movement in the darkness; then upwards\nat the sky, where the stars of the sprawling Scorpion had begun to\npale. Then he dived through a window into a second-class carriage.\n\n\"Mohammed Latif, by the way, what is in these caves, brother? Why\nare we all going to see them?\"\n\nSuch a question was beyond the poor relative's scope. He could only\nreply that God and the local villagers knew, and that the latter\nwould gladly act as guides.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XIV\n\n\nMost of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it,\nand the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are\nobliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own\nexistence. Inside its cocoon of work or social obligation, the\nhuman spirit slumbers for the most part, registering the distinction\nbetween pleasure and pain, but not nearly as alert as we pretend.\nThere are periods in the most thrilling day during which nothing\nhappens, and though we continue to exclaim, \"I do enjoy myself,\"\nor, \"I am horrified,\" we are insincere. \"As far as I feel anything,\nit is enjoyment, horror\"   it's no more than that really, and a\nperfectly adjusted organism would be silent.\n\nIt so happened that Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested had felt nothing\nacutely for a fortnight. Ever since Professor Godbole had sung his\nqueer little song, they had lived more or less inside cocoons, and\nthe difference between them was that the elder lady accepted her\nown apathy, while the younger resented hers. It was Adela's faith\nthat the whole stream of events is important and interesting, and\nif she grew bored she blamed herself severely and compelled her\nlips to utter enthusiasms. This was the only insincerity in a\ncharacter otherwise sincere, and it was indeed the intellectual\nprotest of her youth. She was particularly vexed now because she\nwas both in India and engaged to be married, which double event\nshould have made every instant sublime.\n\nIndia was certainly dim this morning, though seen under the auspices\nof Indians. Her wish had been granted, but too late. She could not\nget excited over Aziz and his arrangements. She was not the least\nunhappy or depressed, and the various odd objects that surrounded\nher   the comic \"purdah\" carriage, the piles of rugs and bolsters,\nthe rolling melons, the scent of sweet oils, the ladder, the\nbrass-bound box, the sudden irruption of Mahmoud Ali's butler from\nthe lavatory with tea and poached eggs upon a tray   they were all\nnew and amusing, and led her to comment appropriately, but they\nwouldn't bite into her mind. So she tried to find comfort by\nreflecting that her main interest would henceforward be Ronny.\n\n\"What a nice cheerful servant! What a relief after Antony!\"\n\n\"They startle one rather. A strange place to make tea in,\" said\nMrs. Moore, who had hoped for a nap.\n\n\"I want to sack Antony. His behaviour on the platform has decided\nme.\"\n\nMrs. Moore thought that Antony's better self would come to the\nfront at Simla. Miss Quested was to be married at Simla; some\ncousins, with a house looking straight on to Thibet, had invited\nher.\n\n\"Anyhow, we must get a second servant, because at Simla you will\nbe at the hotel, and I don't think Ronny's Baldeo . . .\" She loved\nplans.\n\n\"Very well, you get another servant, and I'll keep Antony with me.\nI am used to his unappetizing ways. He will see me through the Hot\nWeather.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in the Hot Weather. People like Major Callendar\nwho always talk about it   it's in the hope of making one feel\ninexperienced and small, like their everlasting,    I've been twenty\nyears in this country.'\"\n\n\"I believe in the Hot Weather, but never did I suppose it would\nbottle me up as it will.\" For owing to the sage leisureliness of\nRonny and Adela, they could not be married till May, and consequently\nMrs. Moore could not return to England immediately after the\nwedding, which was what she had hoped to do. By May a barrier of\nfire would have fallen across India and the adjoining sea, and she\nwould have to remain perched up in the Himalayas waiting for the\nworld to get cooler.\n\n\"I won't be bottled up,\" announced the girl. \"I've no patience with\nthese women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains.\nMrs. McBryde hasn't stopped down once since she married; she leaves\nher quite intelligent husband alone half the year, and then's\nsurprised she's out of touch with him.\"\n\n\"She has children, you see.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, that's true,\" said Miss Quested, disconcerted.\n\n\"It is the children who are the first consideration. Until they\nare grown up, and married off. When that happens one has again the\nright to live for oneself   in the plains or the hills, as suits.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you're perfectly right. I never thought it out.\"\n\n\"If one has not become too stupid and old.\" She handed her empty\ncup to the servant.\n\n\"My idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in Simla,\nat all events to see me through the wedding, after which Ronny\nmeans to reorganize his staff entirely. He does it very well for\na bachelor; still, when he is married no doubt various changes will\nhave to be made   his old servants won't want to take their orders\nfrom me, and I don't blame them.\"\n\nMrs. Moore pushed up the shutters and looked out. She had brought\nRonny and Adela together by their mutual wish, but really she could\nnot advise them further. She felt increasingly (vision or\nnightmare?) that, though people are important, the relations\nbetween them are not, and that in particular too much fuss has been\nmade over marriage; centuries of carnal embracement, yet man is no\nnearer to understanding man. And to-day she felt this with such\nforce that it seemed itself a relationship, itself a person who\nwas trying to take hold of her hand.\n\n\"Anything to be seen of the hills?\"\n\n\"Only various shades of the dark.\"\n\n\"We can't be far from the place where my hyena was.\" She peered\ninto the timeless twilight. The train crossed a nullah. \"Pomper,\npomper, pomper,\" was the sound that the wheels made as they trundled\nover the bridge, moving very slowly. A hundred yards on came a\nsecond nullah, then a third, suggesting the neighbourhood of higher\nground. \"Perhaps this is mine; anyhow, the road runs parallel with\nthe railway.\" Her accident was a pleasant memory; she felt in her\ndry, honest way that it had given her a good shake up, and taught\nher Ronny's true worth. Then she went back to her plans; plans had\nbeen a passion with her from girlhood. Now and then she paid\ntribute to the present, said how friendly and intelligent Aziz was,\nate a guava, couldn't eat a fried sweet, practised her Urdu on the\nservant; but her thoughts ever veered to the manageable future,\nand to the Anglo-Indian life she had decided to endure. And as she\nappraised it with its adjuncts of Turtons and Burtons, the train\naccompanied her sentences, \"pomper, pomper,\" the train half asleep,\ngoing nowhere in particular and with no passenger of importance in\nany of its carriages, the branch-line train, lost on a low\nembankment between dull fields. Its message   for it had one   avoided\nher well-equipped mind. Far away behind her, with a shriek that\nmeant business, rushed the Mail, connecting up important towns such\nas Calcutta and Lahore, where interesting events occur and\npersonalities are developed. She understood that. Unfortunately,\nIndia has few important towns. India is the country, fields,\nfields, then hills, jungle, hills, and more fields. The branch line\nstops, the road is only practicable for cars to a point, the\nbullock-carts lumber down the side tracks, paths fray out into the\ncultivation, and disappear near a splash of red paint. How can the\nmind take hold of such a country? Generations of invaders have\ntried, but they remain in exile. The important towns they build\nare only retreats, their quarrels the malaise of men who cannot\nfind their way home. India knows of their trouble. She knows of\nthe whole world's trouble, to its uttermost depth. She calls \"Come\"\nthrough her hundred mouths, through objects ridiculous and august.\nBut come to what? She has never defined. She is not a promise, only\nan appeal.\n\n\"I will fetch you from Simla when it's cool enough. I will unbottle\nyou in fact,\" continued the reliable girl. \"We then see some of\nthe Mogul stuff   how appalling if we let you miss the Taj!   and then\nI will see you off at Bombay. Your last glimpse of this country\nreally shall be interesting.\" But Mrs. Moore had fallen asleep,\nexhausted by the early start. She was in rather low health, and\nought not to have attempted the expedition, but had pulled herself\ntogether in case the pleasure of the others should suffer. Her\ndreams were of the same texture, but there it was her other children\nwho were wanting something, Stella and Ralph, and she was explaining\nto them that she could not be in two families at once. When she\nawoke, Adela had ceased to plan, and leant out of a window, saying,\n\"They're rather wonderful.\"\n\nAstonishing even from the rise of the civil station, here the\nMarabar were gods to whom earth is a ghost. Kawa Dol was nearest.\nIt shot up in a single slab, on whose summit one rock was poised   if\na mass so great can be called one rock. Behind it, recumbent, were\nthe hills that contained the other caves, isolated each from his\nneighbour by broad channels of the plain. The assemblage, ten in\nall, shifted a little as the train crept past them, as if observing\nits arrival.\n\n\"I'ld not have missed this for anything,\" said the girl, exaggerating\nher enthusiasm. \"Look, the sun's rising   this'll be absolutely\nmagnificent   come quickly   look. I wouldn't have missed this for\nanything. We should never have seen it if we'd stuck to the Turtons\nand their eternal elephants.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the sky to the left turned angry orange. Colour\nthrobbed and mounted behind a pattern of trees, grew in intensity,\nwas yet brighter, incredibly brighter, strained from without\nagainst the globe of the air. They awaited the miracle. But at the\nsupreme moment, when night should have died and day lived, nothing\noccurred. It was as if virtue had failed in the celestial fount.\nThe hues in the east decayed, the hills seemed dimmer though in\nfact better lit, and a profound disappointment entered with the\nmorning breeze. Why, when the chamber was prepared, did the\nbridegroom not enter with trumpets and shawms, as humanity expects?\nThe sun rose without splendour. He was presently observed trailing\nyellowish behind the trees, or against insipid sky, and touching\nthe bodies already at work in the fields.\n\n\"Ah, that must be the false dawn   isn't it caused by dust in the\nupper layers of the atmosphere that couldn't fall down during the\nnight? I think Mr. McBryde said so. Well, I must admit that England\nhas it as regards sunrises. Do you remember Grasmere?\"\n\n\"Ah, dearest Grasmere!\" Its little lakes and mountains were beloved\nby them all. Romantic yet manageable, it sprang from a kindlier\nplanet. Here an untidy plain stretched to the knees of the Marabar.\n\n\"Good morning, good morning, put on your topis,\" shouted Aziz from\nfarther down the train. \"Put on your topis at once, the early sun\nis highly dangerous for heads. I speak as a doctor.\"\n\n\"Good morning, good morning, put on your own.\"\n\n\"Not for my thick head,\" he laughed, banging it and holding up pads\nof his hair.\n\n\"Nice creature he is,\" murmured Adela.\n\n\"Listen   Mohammed Latif says    Good morning' next.\" Various pointless\njests.\n\n\"Dr. Aziz, what's happened to your hills? The train has forgotten\nto stop.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is a circular train and goes back to Chandrapore\nwithout a break. Who knows!\"\n\nHaving wandered off into the plain for a mile, the train slowed up\nagainst an elephant. There was a platform too, but it shrivelled\ninto insignificance. An elephant, waving her painted forehead at\nthe morn! \"Oh, what a surprise!\" called the ladies politely. Aziz\nsaid nothing, but he nearly burst with pride and relief. The\nelephant was the one grand feature of the picnic, and God alone\nknew what he had gone through to obtain her. Semi-official, she\nwas best approached through the Nawab Bahadur, who was best\napproached through Nureddin, but he never answered letters, but\nhis mother had great influence with him and was a friend of\nHamidullah Begum's, who had been excessively kind and had promised\nto call on her provided the broken shutter of the purdah carriage\ncame back soon enough from Calcutta. That an elephant should depend\nfrom so long and so slender a string filled Aziz with content, and\nwith humorous appreciation of the East, where the friends of\nfriends are a reality, where everything gets done sometime, and\nsooner or later every one gets his share of happiness. And Mohammed\nLatif was likewise content, because two of the guests had missed\nthe train, and consequently he could ride on the howdah instead of\nfollowing in a cart, and the servants were content because an\nelephant increased their self-esteem, and they tumbled out the\nluggage into the dust with shouts and bangs, issuing orders to one\nanother, and convulsed with goodwill.\n\n\"It takes an hour to get there, an hour to get back, and two hours\nfor the caves, which we will call three,\" said Aziz, smiling\ncharmingly. There was suddenly something regal about him. \"The\ntrain back is at eleven-thirty, and you will be sitting down to\nyour tiffin in Chandrapore with Mr. Heaslop at exactly your usual\nhour, namely, one-fifteen. I know everything about you. Four\nhours   quite a small expedition   and an hour extra for misfortunes,\nwhich occur somewhat frequently among my people. My idea is to plan\neverything without consulting you; but you, Mrs. Moore, or Miss\nQuested, you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish,\neven if it means giving up the caves. Do you agree? Then mount this\nwild animal.\"\n\nThe elephant had knelt, grey and isolated, like another hill. They\nclimbed up the ladder, and he mounted shikar fashion, treading\nfirst on the sharp edge of the heel and then into the looped-up\ntail. When Mohammed Latif followed him, the servant who held the\nend of the tail let go of it according to previous instructions,\nso that the poor relative slipped and had to cling to the netting\nover the buttocks. It was a little piece of Court buffoonery, and\ndistressed only the ladies, whom it was intended to divert. Both\nof them disliked practical jokes. Then the beast rose in two\nshattering movements, and poised them ten feet above the plain.\nImmediately below was the scurf of life that an elephant always\ncollects round its feet   villagers, naked babies. The servants flung\ncrockery into tongas. Hassan annexed the stallion intended for\nAziz, and defied Mahmoud Ali's man from its altitude. The Brahman\nwho had been hired to cook for Professor Godbole was planted under\nan acacia tree, to await their return. The train, also hoping to\nreturn, wobbled away through the fields, turning its head this way\nand that like a centipede. And the only other movement to be seen\nwas a movement as of antennae, really the counterpoises of the\nwells which rose and fell on their pivots of mud all over the plain\nand dispersed a feeble flow of water. The scene was agreeable\nrather than not in the mild morning air, but there was little\ncolour in it, and no vitality.\n\nAs the elephant moved towards the hills (the pale sun had by this\ntime saluted them to the base, and pencilled shadows down their\ncreases) a new quality occurred, a spiritual silence which invaded\nmore senses than the ear. Life went on as usual, but had no\nconsequences, that is to say, sounds did not echo or thoughts\ndevelop. Everything seemed cut off at its root, and therefore\ninfected with illusion. For instance, there were some mounds by\nthe edge of the track, low, serrated, and touched with whitewash.\nWhat were these mounds   graves, breasts of the goddess Parvati? The\nvillagers beneath gave both replies. Again, there was a confusion\nabout a snake which was never cleared up. Miss Quested saw a thin,\ndark object reared on end at the farther side of a watercourse,\nand said, \"A snake!\" The villagers agreed, and Aziz explained: yes,\na black cobra, very venomous, who had reared himself up to watch\nthe passing of the elephant, But when she looked through Ronny's\nfield-glasses, she found it wasn't a snake, but the withered and\ntwisted stump of a toddy-palm. So she said, \"It isn't a snake.\"\nThe villagers contradicted her. She had put the word into their\nminds, and they refused to abandon it. Aziz admitted that it looked\nlike a tree through the glasses, but insisted that it was a black\ncobra really, and improvised some rubbish about protective mimicry.\nNothing was explained, and yet there was no romance. Films of heat,\nradiated from the Kawa Dol precipices, increased the confusion.\nThey came at irregular intervals and moved capriciously. A patch\nof field would jump as if it was being fried, and then lie quiet.\nAs they drew closer the radiation stopped.\n\nThe elephant walked straight at the Kawa Dol as if she would knock\nfor admission with her forehead, then swerved, and followed a path\nround its base. The stones plunged straight into the earth, like\ncliffs into the sea, and while Miss Quested was remarking on this,\nand saying that it was striking, the plain quietly disappeared,\npeeled off, so to speak, and nothing was to be seen on either side\nbut the granite, very dead and quiet. The sky dominated as usual,\nbut seemed unhealthily near, adhering like a ceiling to the summits\nof the precipices. It was as if the contents of the corridor had\nnever been changed. Occupied by his own munificence, Aziz noticed\nnothing. His guests noticed a little. They did not feel that it\nwas an attractive place or quite worth visiting, and wished it\ncould have turned into some Mohammedan object, such as a mosque,\nwhich their host would have appreciated and explained. His ignorance\nbecame evident, and was really rather a drawback. In spite of his\ngay, confident talk, he had no notion how to treat this particular\naspect of India; he was lost in it without Professor Godbole, like\nthemselves.\n\nThe corridor narrowed, then widened into a sort of tray. Here, more\nor less, was their goal. A ruined tank held a little water which\nwould do for the animals, and close above the mud was punched a\nblack hole   the first of the caves. Three hills encircled the tray.\nTwo of them pumped out heat busily, but the third was in shadow,\nand here they camped.\n\n\"A horrid, stuffy place really,\" murmured Mrs. Moore to herself.\n\n\"How quick your servants are!\" Miss Quested exclaimed. For a cloth\nhad already been laid, with a vase of artificial flowers in its\ncentre, and Mahmoud Ali's butler offered them poached eggs and tea\nfor the second time.\n\n\"I thought we would eat this before our caves, and breakfast\nafter.\"\n\n\"Isn't this breakfast?\"\n\n\"This breakfast? Did you think I should treat you so strangely?\"\nHe had been warned that English people never stop eating, and that\nhe had better nourish them every two hours until a solid meal was\nready.\n\n\"How very well it is all arranged.\"\n\n\"That you shall tell me when I return to Chandrapore. Whatever\ndisgraces I bring upon myself, you remain my guests.\" He spoke\ngravely now. They were dependent on him for a few hours, and he\nfelt grateful to them for placing themselves in such a position.\nAll was well so far; the elephant held a fresh cut bough to her\nlips, the tonga shafts stuck up into the air, the kitchen-boy\npeeled potatoes, Hassan shouted, and Mohammed Latif stood as he\nought, with a peeled switch in his hand. The expedition was a\nsuccess, and it was Indian; an obscure young man had been allowed\nto show courtesy to visitors from another country, which is what\nall Indians long to do   even cynics like Mahmoud Ali   but they never\nhave the chance. Hospitality had been achieved, they were \"his\"\nguests; his honour was involved in their happiness, and any\ndiscomfort they endured would tear his own soul.\n\nLike most Orientals, Aziz overrated hospitality, mistaking it for\nintimacy, and not seeing that it is tainted with the sense of\npossession. It was only when Mrs. Moore or Fielding was near him\nthat he saw further, and knew that it is more blessed to receive\nthan to give. These two had strange and beautiful effects on\nhim   they were his friends, his for ever, and he theirs for ever;\nhe loved them so much that giving and receiving became one. He\nloved them even better than the Hamidullahs, because he had\nsurmounted obstacles to meet them, and this stimulates a generous\nmind. Their images remained somewhere in his soul up to his dying\nday, permanent additions. He looked at her now as she sat on a\ndeck-chair, sipping his tea, and had for a moment a joy that held\nthe seeds of its own decay, for it would lead him to think, \"Oh,\nwhat more can I do for her?\" and so back to the dull round of\nhospitality. The black bullets of his eyes filled with soft\nexpressive light, and he said, \"Do you ever remember our mosque,\nMrs. Moore?\"\n\n\"I do. I do,\" she said, suddenly vital and young.\n\n\"And how rough and rude I was, and how good you were.\"\n\n\"And how happy we both were.\"\n\n\"Friendships last longest that begin like that, I think. Shall I\never entertain your other children?\"\n\n\"Do you know about the others? She will never talk about them to\nme,\" said Miss Quested, unintentionally breaking a spell.\n\n\"Ralph and Stella, yes, I know everything about them. But we must\nnot forget to visit our caves. One of the dreams of my life is\naccomplished in having you both here as my guests. You cannot\nimagine how you have honoured me. I feel like the Emperor Babur.\"\n\n\"Why like him?\" she enquired, rising.\n\n\"Because my ancestors came down with him from Afghanistan. They\njoined him at Herat. He also had often no more elephants than one,\nnone sometimes, but he never ceased showing hospitality. When he\nfought or hunted or ran away, he would always stop for a time among\nhills, just like us; he would never let go of hospitality and\npleasure, and if there was only a little food, he would have it\narranged nicely, and if only one musical instrument, he would\ncompel it to play a beautiful tune. I take him as my ideal. He is\nthe poor gentleman, and he became a great king.\"\n\n\"I thought another Emperor is your favourite   I forget the name   you\nmentioned him at Mr. Fielding's: what my book calls Aurangzebe.\"\n\n\"Alamgir? Oh yes, he was of course the more pious. But Babur   never\nin his whole life did he betray a friend, so I can only think of\nhim this morning. And you know how he died? He laid down his life\nfor his son. A death far more difficult than battle. They were\ncaught in the heat. They should have gone back to Kabul for the\nbad weather, but could not for reasons of state, and at Agra\nHumayun fell sick. Babur walked round the bed three times, and\nsaid,    I have borne it away,' and he did bear it away; the fever\nleft his son and came to him instead, and he died. That is why I\nprefer Babur to Alamgir. I ought not to do so, but I do. However,\nI mustn't delay you. I see you are ready to start.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" she said, sitting down by Mrs. Moore again. \"We enjoy\ntalk like this very much.\" For at last he was talking about what\nhe knew and felt, talking as he had in Fielding's garden-house; he\nwas again the Oriental guide whom they appreciated.\n\n\"I always enjoy conversing about the Moguls. It is the chief\npleasure I know. You see, those first six emperors were all most\nwonderful men, and as soon as one of them is mentioned, no matter\nwhich, I forget everything else in the world except the other five.\nYou could not find six such kings in all the countries of the\nearth, not, I mean, coming one after the other   father, son.\"\n\n\"Tell us something about Akbar.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have heard the name of Akbar. Good. Hamidullah   whom you\nshall meet   will tell you that Akbar is the greatest of all. I say,\n   Yes, Akbar is very wonderful, but half a Hindu; he was not a true\nMoslem, which makes Hamidullah cry,    No more was Babur, he drank\nwine.' But Babur always repented afterwards, which makes the entire\ndifference, and Akbar never repented of the new religion he invented\ninstead of the Holy Koran.\"\n\n\"But wasn't Akbar's new religion very fine? It was to embrace the\nwhole of India.\"\n\n\"Miss Quested, fine but foolish. You keep your religion, I mine.\nThat is the best. Nothing embraces the whole of India, nothing,\nnothing, and that was Akbar's mistake.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you feel that, Dr. Aziz?\" she said thoughtfully. \"I hope\nyou're not right. There will have to be something universal in this\ncountry   I don't say religion, for I'm not religious, but something,\nor how else are barriers to be broken down?\"\n\nShe was only recommending the universal brotherhood he sometimes\ndreamed of, but as soon as it was put into prose it became untrue.\n\n\"Take my own case,\" she continued   it was indeed her own case that\nhad animated her. \"I don't know whether you happen to have heard,\nbut I'm going to marry Mr. Heaslop.\"\n\n\"On which my heartiest congratulations.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, may I put our difficulty to Dr. Aziz   I mean our\nAnglo-Indian one?\"\n\n\"It is your difficulty, not mine, my dear.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's true. Well, by marrying Mr. Heaslop, I shall become\nwhat is known as an Anglo-Indian.\"\n\nHe held up his hand in protest. \"Impossible. Take back such a\nterrible remark.\"\n\n\"But I shall; it's inevitable. I can't avoid the label. What I do\nhope to avoid is the mentality. Women like      \" She stopped, not\nquite liking to mention names; she would boldly have said \"Mrs.\nTurton and Mrs. Callendar\" a fortnight ago. \"Some women are so   well,\nungenerous and snobby about Indians, and I should feel too ashamed\nfor words if I turned like them, but   and here's my difficulty   there's\nnothing special about me, nothing specially good or strong, which\nwill help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them.\nI've most lamentable defects. That's why I want Akbar's    universal\nreligion' or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible. Do you\nsee what I mean?\"\n\nHer remarks pleased him, but his mind shut up tight because she\nhad alluded to her marriage. He was not going to be mixed up in\nthat side of things. \"You are certain to be happy with any relative\nof Mrs. Moore's,\" he said with a formal bow.\n\n\"Oh, my happiness   that's quite another problem. I want to consult\nyou about this Anglo-Indian difficulty. Can you give me any advice?\"\n\n\"You are absolutely unlike the others, I assure you. You will never\nbe rude to my people.\"\n\n\"I am told we all get rude after a year.\"\n\n\"Then you are told a lie,\" he flashed, for she had spoken the truth\nand it touched him on the raw; it was itself an insult in these\nparticular circumstances. He recovered himself at once and laughed,\nbut her error broke up their conversation   their civilization it\nhad almost been   which scattered like the petals of a desert flower,\nand left them in the middle of the hills. \"Come along,\" he said,\nholding out a hand to each. They got up a little reluctantly, and\naddressed themselves to sightseeing.\n\nThe first cave was tolerably convenient. They skirted the puddle\nof water, and then climbed up over some unattractive stones, the\nsun crashing on their backs. Bending their heads, they disappeared\none by one into the interior of the hills. The small black hole\ngaped where their varied forms and colours had momentarily\nfunctioned. They were sucked in like water down a drain. Bland and\nbald rose the precipices; bland and glutinous the sky that connected\nthe precipices; solid and white, a Brahminy kite flapped between\nthe rocks with a clumsiness that seemed intentional. Before man,\nwith his itch for the seemly, had been born, the planet must have\nlooked thus. The kite flapped away. . . . Before birds, perhaps. . . .\nAnd then the hole belched and humanity returned.\n\nA Marabar cave had been horrid as far as Mrs. Moore was concerned,\nfor she had nearly fainted in it, and had some difficulty in\npreventing herself from saying so as soon as she got into the air\nagain. It was natural enough: she had always suffered from\nfaintness, and the cave had become too full, because all their\nretinue followed them. Crammed with villagers and servants, the\ncircular chamber began to smell. She lost Aziz and Adela in the\ndark, didn't know who touched her, couldn't breathe, and some vile\nnaked thing struck her face and settled on her mouth like a pad.\nShe tried to regain the entrance tunnel, but an influx of villagers\nswept her back. She hit her head. For an instant she went mad,\nhitting and gasping like a fanatic. For not only did the crush and\nstench alarm her; there was also a terrifying echo.\n\nProfessor Godbole had never mentioned an echo; it never impressed\nhim, perhaps. There are some exquisite echoes in India; there is\nthe whisper round the dome at Bijapur; there are the long, solid\nsentences that voyage through the air at Mandu, and return unbroken\nto their creator. The echo in a Marabar cave is not like these, it\nis entirely devoid of distinction. Whatever is said, the same\nmonotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until\nit is absorbed into the roof. \"Boum\" is the sound as far as the\nhuman alphabet can express it, or \"bou-oum,\" or \"ou-boum,\"   utterly\ndull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a\nboot, all produce \"boum.\" Even the striking of a match starts a\nlittle worm coiling, which is too small to complete a circle but\nis eternally watchful. And if several people talk at once, an\noverlapping howling noise begins, echoes generate echoes, and the\ncave is stuffed with a snake composed of small snakes, which writhe\nindependently.\n\nAfter Mrs. Moore all the others poured out. She had given the\nsignal for the reflux. Aziz and Adela both emerged smiling and she\ndid not want him to think his treat was a failure, so smiled too.\nAs each person emerged she looked for a villain, but none was\nthere, and she realized that she had been among the mildest\nindividuals, whose only desire was to honour her, and that the\nnaked pad was a poor little baby, astride its mother's hip. Nothing\nevil had been in the cave, but she had not enjoyed herself; no,\nshe had not enjoyed herself, and she decided not to visit a second\none.\n\n\"Did you see the reflection of his match   rather pretty?\" asked\nAdela.\n\n\"I forget . . .\"\n\n\"But he says this isn't a good cave, the best are on the Kawa Dol.\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall go on to there. I dislike climbing.\"\n\n\"Very well, let's sit down again in the shade until breakfast's\nready.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that'll disappoint him so; he has taken such trouble. You\nshould go on; you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to,\" said the girl, indifferent to what she did,\nbut desirous of being amiable.\n\nThe servants, etc., were scrambling back to the camp, pursued by\ngrave censures from Mohammed Latif. Aziz came to help the guests\nover the rocks. He was at the summit of his powers, vigorous and\nhumble, too sure of himself to resent criticism, and he was\nsincerely pleased when he heard they were altering his plans.\n\"Certainly, Miss Quested, so you and I will go together, and leave\nMrs. Moore here, and we will not be long, yet we will not hurry,\nbecause we know that will be her wish.\"\n\n\"Quite right. I'm sorry not to come too, but I'm a poor walker.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Moore, what does anything matter so long as you are my\nguests? I am very glad you are _not_ coming, which sounds strange,\nbut you are treating me with true frankness, as a friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am your friend,\" she said, laying her hand on his sleeve,\nand thinking, despite her fatigue, how very charming, how very\ngood, he was, and how deeply she desired his happiness. \"So may I\nmake another suggestion? Don't let so many people come with you\nthis time. I think you may find it more convenient.\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly,\" he cried, and, rushing to the other extreme,\nforbade all except one guide to accompany Miss Quested and him to\nthe Kawa Dol. \"Is that all right?\" he enquired.\n\n\"Quite right, now enjoy yourselves, and when you come back tell me\nall about it.\" And she sank into the deck-chair.\n\nIf they reached the big pocket of caves, they would be away nearly\nan hour. She took out her writing-pad, and began, \"Dear Stella,\nDear Ralph,\" then stopped, and looked at the queer valley and their\nfeeble invasion of it. Even the elephant had become a nobody. Her\neye rose from it to the entrance tunnel. No, she did not wish to\nrepeat that experience. The more she thought over it, the more\ndisagreeable and frightening it became. She minded it much more\nnow than at the time. The crush and the smells she could forget,\nbut the echo began in some indescribable way to undermine her hold\non life. Coming at a moment when she chanced to be fatigued, it\nhad managed to murmur, \"Pathos, piety, courage   they exist, but are\nidentical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value.\"\nIf one had spoken vileness in that place, or quoted lofty poetry,\nthe comment would have been the same   \"ou-boum.\" If one had spoken\nwith the tongues of angels and pleaded for all the unhappiness and\nmisunderstanding in the world, past, present, and to come, for all\nthe misery men must undergo whatever their opinion and position,\nand however much they dodge or bluff   it would amount to the same,\nthe serpent would descend and return to the ceiling. Devils are of\nthe North, and poems can be written about them, but no one could\nromanticize the Marabar because it robbed infinity and eternity of\ntheir vastness, the only quality that accommodates them to mankind.\n\nShe tried to go on with her letter, reminding herself that she was\nonly an elderly woman who had got up too early in the morning and\njourneyed too far, that the despair creeping over her was merely\nher despair, her personal weakness, and that even if she got a\nsunstroke and went mad the rest of the world would go on. But\nsuddenly, at the edge of her mind, Religion appeared, poor little\ntalkative Christianity, and she knew that all its divine words from\n\"Let there be Light\" to \"It is finished\" only amounted to \"boum.\"\nThen she was terrified over an area larger than usual; the universe,\nnever comprehensible to her intellect, offered no repose to her\nsoul, the mood of the last two months took definite form at last,\nand she realized that she didn't want to write to her children,\ndidn't want to communicate with anyone, not even with God. She sat\nmotionless with horror, and, when old Mohammed Latif came up to\nher, thought he would notice a difference. For a time she thought,\n\"I am going to be ill,\" to comfort herself, then she surrendered\nto the vision. She lost all interest, even in Aziz, and the\naffectionate and sincere words that she had spoken to him seemed\nno longer hers but the air's.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

They did not talk much, for the sun was getting high.\nThe air felt like a warm bath into which hotter water is trickling\nconstantly, the temperature rose and rose, the boulders said, \"I\nam alive,\" the small stones answered, \"I am almost alive.\" Between\nthe chinks lay the ashes of little plants. They meant to climb to\nthe rocking-stone on the summit, but it was too far, and they\ncontented themselves with the big group of caves. _En route_ for\nthese, they encountered several isolated caves, which the guide\npersuaded them to visit, but really there was nothing to see; they\nlit a match, admired its reflection in the polish, tested the echo\nand came out again. Aziz was \"pretty sure they should come on some\ninteresting old carvings soon,\" but only meant he wished there were\nsome carvings. His deeper thoughts were about the breakfast.\nSymptoms of disorganization had appeared as he left the camp. He\nran over the menu: an English breakfast, porridge and mutton chops,\nbut some Indian dishes to cause conversation, and pan afterwards.\nHe had never liked Miss Quested as much as Mrs. Moore, and had\nlittle to say to her, less than ever now that she would marry a\nBritish official.\n\nNor had Adela much to say to him. If his mind was with the\nbreakfast, hers was mainly with her marriage. Simla next week, get\nrid of Antony, a view of Thibet, tiresome wedding bells, Agra in\nOctober, see Mrs. Moore comfortably off from Bombay   the procession\npassed before her again, blurred by the heat, and then she turned\nto the more serious business of her life at Chandrapore. There were\nreal difficulties here   Ronny's limitations and her own   but she\nenjoyed facing difficulties, and decided that if she could control\nher peevishness (always her weak point), and neither rail against\nAnglo-India nor succumb to it, their married life ought to be happy\nand profitable. She mustn't be too theoretical; she would deal with\neach problem as it came up, and trust to Ronny's common sense and\nher own. Luckily, each had abundance of common sense and good will.\n\nBut as she toiled over a rock that resembled an inverted saucer,\nshe thought, \"What about love?\" The rock was nicked by a double\nrow of footholds, and somehow the question was suggested by them.\nWhere had she seen footholds before? Oh yes, they were the pattern\ntraced in the dust by the wheels of the Nawab Bahadur's car. She\nand Ronny   no, they did not love each other.\n\n\"Do I take you too fast?\" enquired Aziz, for she had paused, a\ndoubtful expression on her face. The discovery had come so suddenly\nthat she felt like a mountaineer whose rope had broken. Not to love\nthe man one's going to marry! Not to find it out till this moment!\nNot even to have asked oneself the question until now! Something\nelse to think out. Vexed rather than appalled, she stood still,\nher eyes on the sparkling rock. There was esteem and animal contact\nat dusk, but the emotion that links them was absent. Ought she to\nbreak her engagement off? She was inclined to think not   it would\ncause so much trouble to others; besides, she wasn't convinced that\nlove is necessary to a successful union. If love is everything,\nfew marriages would survive the honeymoon. \"No, I'm all right,\nthanks,\" she said, and, her emotions well under control, resumed\nthe climb, though she felt a bit dashed. Aziz held her hand, the\nguide adhered to the surface like a lizard and scampered about as\nif governed by a personal centre of gravity.\n\n\"Are you married, Dr. Aziz?\" she asked, stopping again, and\nfrowning.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, do come and see my wife\"   for he felt it more artistic\nto have his wife alive for a moment.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said absently.\n\n\"She is not in Chandrapore just now.\"\n\n\"And have you children?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, three,\" he replied in firmer tones.\n\n\"Are they a great pleasure to you?\"\n\n\"Why, naturally, I adore them,\" he laughed.\n\n\"I suppose so.\" What a handsome little Oriental he was, and no\ndoubt his wife and children were beautiful too, for people usually\nget what they already possess. She did not admire him with any\npersonal warmth, for there was nothing of the vagrant in her blood,\nbut she guessed he might attract women of his own race and rank,\nand she regretted that neither she nor Ronny had physical charm.\nIt does make a difference in a relationship   beauty, thick hair, a\nfine skin. Probably this man had several wives   Mohammedans always\ninsist on their full four, according to Mrs. Turton. And having no\none else to speak to on that eternal rock, she gave rein to the\nsubject of marriage and said in her honest, decent, inquisitive\nway: \"Have you one wife or more than one?\"\n\nThe question shocked the young man very much. It challenged a new\nconviction of his community, and new convictions are more sensitive\nthan old. If she had said, \"Do you worship one god or several?\" he\nwould not have objected. But to ask an educated Indian Moslem how\nmany wives he has   appalling, hideous! He was in trouble how to\nconceal his confusion. \"One, one in my own particular case,\" he\nsputtered, and let go of her hand. Quite a number of caves were at\nthe top of the track, and thinking, \"Damn the English even at their\nbest,\" he plunged into one of them to recover his balance. She\nfollowed at her leisure, quite unconscious that she had said the\nwrong thing, and not seeing him, she also went into a cave, thinking\nwith half her mind \"sight-seeing bores me,\" and wondering with the\nother half about marriage.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

But they could not\nget a good view of it, because the precipitous bastion curved at\nthe top, so that the base was not easily seen and the car\ndisappeared as it came nearer.

The guide\nexplained that she had gone into a cave. \"Which cave?\"\n\nHe indicated the group vaguely.\n\n\"You should have kept her in sight, it was your duty,\" said Aziz\nseverely. \"Here are twelve caves at least. How am I to know which\ncontains my guest? Which is the cave I was in myself?\"\n\nThe same vague gesture. And Aziz, looking again, could not even be\nsure he had returned to the same group. Caves appeared in every\ndirection   it seemed their original spawning place   and the orifices\nwere always the same size. He thought, \"Merciful Heavens, Miss\nQuested is lost,\" then pulled himself together, and began to look\nfor her calmly.\n\n\"Shout!\" he commanded.\n\nWhen they had done this for awhile, the guide explained that to\nshout is useless, because a Marabar cave can hear no sound but its\nown. Aziz wiped his head, and sweat began to stream inside his\nclothes. The place was so confusing; it was partly a terrace,\npartly a zigzag, and full of grooves that led this way and that\nlike snake-tracks. He tried to go into every one, but he never knew\nwhere he had started. Caves got behind caves or confabulated in\npairs, and some were at the entrance of a gully.\n\n\"Come here!\" he called gently, and when the guide was in reach, he\nstruck him in the face for a punishment. The man fled, and he was\nleft alone. He thought, \"This is the end of my career, my guest is\nlost.\" And then he discovered the simple and sufficient explanation\nof the mystery.\n\nMiss Quested wasn't lost. She had joined the people in the\ncar   friends of hers, no doubt, Mr. Heaslop perhaps. He had a sudden\nglimpse of her, far down the gully   only a glimpse, but there she\nwas quite plain, framed between rocks, and speaking to another\nlady. He was so relieved that he did not think her conduct odd.\nAccustomed to sudden changes of plan, he supposed that she had run\ndown the Kawa Dol impulsively, in the hope of a little drive. He\nstarted back alone towards his camp, and almost at once caught\nsight of something which would have disquieted him very much a\nmoment before: Miss Quested's field-glasses. They were lying at\nthe verge of a cave, half-way down an entrance tunnel. He tried to\nhang them over his shoulder, but the leather strap had broken, so\nhe put them into his pocket instead. When he had gone a few steps,\nhe thought she might have dropped something else, so he went back\nto look.\n\nBut the previous difficulty recurred: he couldn't identify the\ncave. Down in the plain he heard the car starting; however, he\ncouldn't catch a second glimpse of that. So he scrambled down the\nvalley-face of the hill towards Mrs. Moore, and here he was more\nsuccessful: the colour and confusion of his little camp soon\nappeared, and in the midst of it he saw an Englishman's topi, and\nbeneath it   oh joy!   smiled not Mr. Heaslop, but Fielding.\n\n\"Fielding! Oh, I have so wanted you!\" he cried, dropping the \"Mr.\"\nfor the first time.\n\nAnd his friend ran to meet him, all so pleasant and jolly, no\ndignity, shouting explanations and apologies about the train.\nFielding had come in the newly arrived car   Miss Derek's car   that\nother lady was Miss Derek. Chatter, chatter, all the servants\nleaving their cooking to listen. Excellent Miss Derek! She had met\nFielding by chance at the post office, said, \"Why haven't you gone\nto the Marabar?\" heard how he missed the train, offered to run him\nthere and then. Another nice English lady. Where was she? Left with\ncar and chauffeur while Fielding found camp. Car couldn't get\nup   no, of course not   hundreds of people must go down to escort Miss\nDerek and show her the way. The elephant in person. . . .\n\n\"Aziz, can I have a drink?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\" He flew to get one.\n\n\"Mr. Fielding!\" called Mrs. Moore, from her patch of shade; they\nhad not spoken yet, because his arrival had coincided with the\ntorrent from the hill.\n\n\"Good morning again!\" he cried, relieved to find all well.\n\n\"Mr. Fielding, have you seen Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"But I've only just arrived. Where is she?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Aziz! Where have you put Miss Quested to?\" Aziz, who was returning\nwith a drink in his hand, had to think for a moment. His heart was\nfull of new happiness. The picnic, after a nasty shock or two, had\ndeveloped into something beyond his dreams, for Fielding had not\nonly come, but brought an uninvited guest. \"Oh, she's all right,\"\nhe said; \"she went down to see Miss Derek. Well, here's luck!\nChin-chin!\"\n\n\"Here's luck, but chin-chin I do refuse,\" laughed Fielding, who\ndetested the phrase. \"Here's to India!\"\n\n\"Here's luck, and here's to England!\"\n\nMiss Derek's chauffeur stopped the cavalcade which was starting to\nescort his mistress up, and informed it that she had gone back with\nthe other young lady to Chandrapore; she had sent him to say so.\nShe was driving herself.\n\n\"Oh yes, that's quite likely,\" said Aziz. \"I knew they'd gone for\na spin.\"\n\n\"Chandrapore? The man's made a mistake,\" Fielding exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh no, why?\" He was disappointed, but made light of it; no doubt\nthe two young ladies were great friends. He would prefer to give\nbreakfast to all four; still, guests must do as they wish, or they\nbecome prisoners. He went away cheerfully to inspect the porridge\nand the ice.\n\n\"What's happened?\" asked Fielding, who felt at once that something\nhad gone queer. All the way out Miss Derek had chattered about the\npicnic, called it an unexpected treat, and said that she preferred\nIndians who didn't invite her to their entertainments to those who\ndid it. Mrs. Moore sat swinging her foot, and appeared sulky and\nstupid. She said: \"Miss Derek is most unsatisfactory and restless,\nalways in a hurry, always wanting something new; she will do\nanything in the world except go back to the Indian lady who pays\nher.\"\n\nFielding, who didn't dislike Miss Derek, replied: \"She wasn't in\na hurry when I left her. There was no question of returning to\nChandrapore. It looks to me as if Miss Quested's in the hurry.\"\n\n\"Adela?   she's never been in a hurry in her life,\" said the old lady\nsharply.\n\n\"I say it'll prove to be Miss Quested's wish, in fact I know it\nis,\" persisted the schoolmaster. He was annoyed   chiefly with\nhimself. He had begun by missing a train   a sin he was never guilty\nof   and now that he did arrive it was to upset Aziz' arrangements\nfor the second time. He wanted someone to share the blame, and\nfrowned at Mrs. Moore rather magisterially. \"Aziz is a charming\nfellow,\" he announced.\n\n\"I know,\" she answered, with a yawn.\n\n\"He has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic.\"\n\nThey knew one another very little, and felt rather awkward at being\ndrawn together by an Indian. The racial problem can take subtle\nforms. In their case it had induced a sort of jealousy, a mutual\nsuspicion. He tried to goad her enthusiasm; she scarcely spoke.\nAziz fetched them to breakfast.\n\n\"It is quite natural about Miss Quested,\" he remarked, for he had\nbeen working the incident a little in his mind, to get rid of its\nroughnesses. \"We were having an interesting talk with our guide,\nthen the car was seen, so she decided to go down to her friend.\"\nIncurably inaccurate, he already thought that this was what had\noccurred. He was inaccurate because he was sensitive. He did not\nlike to remember Miss Quested's remark about polygamy, because it\nwas unworthy of a guest, so he put it from his mind, and with it\nthe knowledge that he had bolted into a cave to get away from her.\nHe was inaccurate because he desired to honour her, and   facts being\nentangled   he had to arrange them in her vicinity, as one tidies\nthe ground after extracting a weed. Before breakfast was over, he\nhad told a good many lies. \"She ran to her friend, I to mine,\" he\nwent on, smiling. \"And now I am with my friends and they are with\nme and each other, which is happiness.\"\n\nLoving them both, he expected them to love each other. They didn't\nwant to. Fielding thought with hostility, \"I knew these women would\nmake trouble,\" and Mrs. Moore thought, \"This man, having missed\nthe train, tries to blame us\"; but her thoughts were feeble; since\nher faintness in the cave she was sunk in apathy and cynicism. The\nwonderful India of her opening weeks, with its cool nights and\nacceptable hints of infinity, had vanished.\n\nFielding ran up to see one cave. He wasn't impressed. Then they\ngot on the elephant and the picnic began to unwind out of the\ncorridor and escaped under the precipice towards the railway\nstation, pursued by stabs of hot air. They came to the place where\nhe had quitted the car. A disagreeable thought now struck him, and\nhe said: \"Aziz, exactly where and how did you leave Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"Up there.\" He indicated the Kawa Dol cheerfully.\n\n\"But how      \" A gully, or rather a crease, showed among the rocks at\nthis place; it was scurfy with cactuses. \"I suppose the guide\nhelped her.\"\n\n\"Oh, rather, most helpful.\"\n\n\"Is there a path off the top?\"\n\n\"Millions of paths, my dear fellow.\"\n\nFielding could see nothing but the crease. Everywhere else the\nglaring granite plunged into the earth.\n\n\"But you saw them get down safe?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, she and Miss Derek, and go off in the car.\"\n\n\"Then the guide came back to you?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Got a cigarette?\"\n\n\"I hope she wasn't ill,\" pursued the Englishman. The crease\ncontinued as a nullah across the plain, the water draining off this\nway towards the Ganges.\n\n\"She would have wanted me, if she was ill, to attend her.\"\n\n\"Yes, that sounds sense.\"\n\n\"I see you're worrying, let's talk of other things,\" he said\nkindly. \"Miss Quested was always to do what she wished, it was our\narrangement. I see you are worrying on my account, but really I\ndon't mind, I never notice trifles.\"\n\n\"I do worry on your account. I consider they have been impolite!\"\nsaid Fielding, lowering his voice. \"She had no right to dash away\nfrom your party, and Miss Derek had no right to abet her.\"\n\nSo touchy as a rule, Aziz was unassailable. The wings that uplifted\nhim did not falter, because he was a Mogul emperor who had done\nhis duty. Perched on his elephant, he watched the Marabar Hills\nrecede, and saw again, as provinces of his kingdom, the grim untidy\nplain, the frantic and feeble movements of the buckets, the white\nshrines, the shallow graves, the suave sky, the snake that looked\nlike a tree. He had given his guests as good a time as he could,\nand if they came late or left early that was not his affair. Mrs.\nMoore slept, swaying against the rods of the howdah, Mohammed Latif\nembraced her with efficiency and respect, and by his own side sat\nFielding, whom he began to think of as \"Cyril.\"\n\n\"Aziz, have you figured out what this picnic will cost you?\"\n\n\"Sh! my dear chap, don't mention that part. Hundreds and hundreds\nof rupees. The completed account will be too awful; my friends'\nservants have robbed me right and left, and as for an elephant,\nshe apparently eats gold. I can trust you not to repeat this. And\nM.L.   please employ initials, he listens   is far the worst of all.\"\n\n\"I told you he's no good.\"\n\n\"He is plenty of good for himself; his dishonesty will ruin me.\"\n\n\"Aziz, how monstrous!\"\n\n\"I am delighted with him really, he has made my guests comfortable;\nbesides, it is my duty to employ him, he is my cousin. If money\ngoes, money comes. If money stays, death comes. Did you ever hear\nthat useful Urdu proverb? Probably not, for I have just invented\nit.\"\n\n\"My proverbs are: A penny saved is a penny earned; A stitch in time\nsaves nine; Look before you leap; and the British Empire rests on\nthem. You will never kick us out, you know, until you cease\nemploying M.L.'s and such.\"\n\n\"Oh, kick you out? Why should I trouble over that dirty job? Leave\nit to the politicians. . . . No, when I was a student I got excited\nover your damned countrymen, certainly; but if they'll let me get\non with my profession and not be too rude to me officially, I\nreally don't ask for more.\"\n\n\"But you do; you take them to a picnic.\"\n\n\"This picnic is nothing to do with English or Indian; it is an\nexpedition of friends.\"\n\nSo the cavalcade ended, partly pleasant, partly not; the Brahman\ncook was picked up, the train arrived, pushing its burning throat\nover the plain, and the twentieth century took over from the\nsixteenth. Mrs. Moore entered her carriage, the three men went to\ntheirs, adjusted the shutters, turned on the electric fan and tried\nto get some sleep. In the twilight, all resembled corpses, and the\ntrain itself seemed dead though it moved   a coffin from the\nscientific north which troubled the scenery four times a day. As\nit left the Marabars, their nasty little cosmos disappeared, and\ngave place to the Marabars seen from a distance, finite and rather\nromantic. The train halted once under a pump, to drench the stock\nof coal in its tender. Then it caught sight of the main line in\nthe distance, took courage, and bumped forward, rounded the civil\nstation, surmounted the level-crossing (the rails were scorching\nnow), and clanked to a stand-still. Chandrapore, Chandrapore! The\nexpedition was over.\n\nAnd as it ended, as they sat up in the gloom and prepared to enter\nordinary life, suddenly the long drawn strangeness of the morning\nsnapped. Mr. Haq, the Inspector of Police, flung open the door of\ntheir carriage and said in shrill tones: \"Dr. Aziz, it is my highly\npainful duty to arrest you.\"\n\n\"Hullo, some mistake,\" said Fielding, at once taking charge of the\nsituation.\n\n\"Sir, they are my instructions. I know nothing.\"\n\n\"On what charge do you arrest him?\"\n\n\"I am under instructions not to say.\"\n\n\"Don't answer me like that. Produce your warrant.\"\n\n\"Sir, excuse me, no warrant is required under these particular\ncircumstances. Refer to Mr. McBryde.\"\n\n\"Very well, so we will. Come along, Aziz, old man; nothing to fuss\nabout, some blunder.\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz, will you kindly come?   a closed conveyance stands in\nreadiness.\"\n\nThe young man sobbed   his first sound   and tried to escape out of\nthe opposite door on to the line.\n\n\"That will compel me to use force,\" Mr. Haq wailed.\n\n\"Oh, for God's sake      \" cried Fielding, his own nerves breaking\nunder the contagion, and pulled him back before a scandal started,\nand shook him like a baby. A second later, and he would have been\nout, whistles blowing, a man-hunt. . . . \"Dear fellow, we're coming\nto McBryde together, and enquire what's gone wrong   he's a decent\nfellow, it's all unintentional . . . he'll apologize. Never, never\nact the criminal.\"\n\n\"My children and my name!\" he gasped, his wings broken.\n\n\"Nothing of the sort. Put your hat straight and take my arm. I'll\nsee you through.\"\n\n\"Ah, thank God, he comes,\" the Inspector exclaimed. They emerged\ninto the midday heat, arm in arm. The station was seething.\nPassengers and porters rushed out of every recess, many Government\nservants, more police. Ronny escorted Mrs. Moore. Mohammed Latif\nbegan wailing. And before they could make their way through the\nchaos, Fielding was called off by the authoritative tones of Mr.\nTurton, and Aziz went on to prison alone.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

When Fielding entered the\ndoors clapped to, and were guarded by a servant, while a punkah,\nto mark the importance of the moment, flapped dirty petticoats over\ntheir heads. The Collector could not speak at first. His face was\nwhite, fanatical, and rather beautiful   the expression that all\nEnglish faces were to wear at Chandrapore for many days. Always\nbrave and unselfish, he was now fused by some white and generous\nheat; he would have killed himself, obviously, if he had thought\nit right to do so. He spoke at last. \"The worst thing in my whole\ncareer has happened,\" he said. \"Miss Quested has been insulted in\none of the Marabar caves.\"\n\n\"Oh no, oh no, no,\" gasped the other, feeling sickish.\n\n\"She escaped   by God's grace.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no, but not Aziz . . . not Aziz . . .\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Absolutely impossible, grotesque.\"\n\n\"I called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to\nyou if you were seen accompanying him to the Police Station,\" said\nTurton, paying no attention to his protest, indeed scarcely hearing\nit.\n\nHe repeated \"Oh no,\" like a fool. He couldn't frame other words.\nHe felt that a mass of madness had arisen and tried to overwhelm\nthem all; it had to be shoved back into its pit somehow, and he\ndidn't know how to do it, because he did not understand madness:\nhe had always gone about sensibly and quietly until a difficulty\ncame right. \"Who lodges this infamous charge?\" he asked, pulling\nhimself together.\n\n\"Miss Derek and   the victim herself. . . .\" He nearly broke down,\nunable to repeat the girl's name.\n\n\"Miss Quested herself definitely accuses him of      \"\n\nHe nodded and turned his face away.\n\n\"Then she's mad.\"\n\n\"I cannot pass that last remark,\" said the Collector, waking up to\nthe knowledge that they differed, and trembling with fury. \"You\nwill withdraw it instantly. It is the type of remark you have\npermitted yourself to make ever since you came to Chandrapore.\"\n\n\"I'm excessively sorry, sir; I certainly withdraw it unconditionally.\"\nFor the man was half mad himself.\n\n\"Pray, Mr. Fielding, what induced you to speak to me in such a\ntone?\"\n\n\"The news gave me a very great shock, so I must ask you to forgive\nme. I cannot believe that Dr. Aziz is guilty.\"\n\nHe slammed his hand on the table. \"That   that is a repetition of\nyour insult in an aggravated form.\"\n\n\"If I may venture to say so, no,\" said Fielding, also going white,\nbut sticking to his point. \"I make no reflection on the good faith\nof the two ladies, but the charge they are bringing against Aziz\nrests upon some mistake, and five minutes will clear it up. The\nman's manner is perfectly natural; besides, I know him to be\nincapable of infamy.\"\n\n\"It does indeed rest upon a mistake,\" came the thin, biting voice\nof the other. \"It does indeed. I have had twenty-five years'\nexperience of this country\"   he paused, and \"twenty-five years\"\nseemed to fill the waiting-room with their staleness and\nungenerosity   \"and during those twenty-five years I have never known\nanything but disaster result when English people and Indians\nattempt to be intimate socially. Intercourse, yes. Courtesy, by\nall means. Intimacy   never, never. The whole weight of my authority\nis against it. I have been in charge at Chandrapore for six years,\nand if everything has gone smoothly, if there has been mutual\nrespect and esteem, it is because both peoples kept to this simple\nrule. New-comers set our traditions aside, and in an instant what\nyou see happens, the work of years is undone and the good name of\nmy District ruined for a generation. I   I   can't see the end of this\nday's work, Mr. Fielding. You, who are imbued with modern ideas   no\ndoubt you can. I wish I had never lived to see its beginning, I\nknow that. It is the end of me. That a lady, that a young lady\nengaged to my most valued subordinate   that she   an English girl\nfresh from England   that I should have lived      \"\n\nInvolved in his own emotions, he broke down. What he had said was\nboth dignified and pathetic, but had it anything to do with Aziz?\nNothing at all, if Fielding was right. It is impossible to regard\na tragedy from two points of view, and whereas Turton had decided\nto avenge the girl, he hoped to save the man. He wanted to get away\nand talk to McBryde, who had always been friendly to him, was on\nthe whole sensible, and could, anyhow, be trusted to keep cool.\n\n\"I came down particularly on your account   while poor Heaslop got\nhis mother away. I regarded it as the most friendly thing I could\ndo. I meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at\nthe club this evening to discuss the situation, but I am doubtful\nwhether you will care to come. Your visits there are always\ninfrequent.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly come, sir, and I am most grateful to you for\nall the trouble you have taken over me. May I venture to ask   where\nMiss Quested is.\"\n\nHe replied with a gesture; she was ill.\n\n\"Worse and worse, appalling,\" he said feelingly.\n\nBut the Collector looked at him sternly, because he was keeping\nhis head. He had not gone mad at the phrase \"an English girl fresh\nfrom England,\" he had not rallied to the banner of race. He was\nstill after facts, though the herd had decided on emotion. Nothing\nenrages Anglo-India more than the lantern of reason if it is\nexhibited for one moment after its extinction is decreed. All over\nChandrapore that day the Europeans were putting aside their normal\npersonalities and sinking themselves in their community. Pity,\nwrath, heroism, filled them, but the power of putting two and two\ntogether was annihilated.\n\nTerminating the interview, the Collector walked on to the platform.\nThe confusion there was revolting. A chuprassi of Ronny's had been\ntold to bring up some trifles belonging to the ladies, and was\nappropriating for himself various articles to which he had no\nright; he was a camp follower of the angry English. Mohammed Latif\nmade no attempt to resist him. Hassan flung off his turban, and\nwept. All the comforts that had been provided so liberally were\nrolled about and wasted in the sun. The Collector took in the\nsituation at a glance, and his sense of justice functioned though\nhe was insane with rage. He spoke the necessary word, and the\nlooting stopped. Then he drove off to his bungalow and gave rein\nto his passions again. When he saw the coolies asleep in the\nditches or the shopkeepers rising to salute him on their little\nplatforms, he said to himself: \"I know what you're like at last;\nyou shall pay for this, you shall squeal.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ",

He had\nread and thought a good deal, and, owing to a somewhat unhappy\nmarriage, had evolved a complete philosophy of life. There was much\nof the cynic about him, but nothing of the bully; he never lost\nhis temper or grew rough, and he received Aziz with courtesy, was\nalmost reassuring. \"I have to detain you until you get bail,\" he\nsaid, \"but no doubt your friends will be applying for it, and of\ncourse they will be allowed to visit you, under regulations. I am\ngiven certain information, and have to act on it   I'm not your\njudge.\" Aziz was led off weeping. Mr. McBryde was shocked at his\ndownfall, but no Indian ever surprised him, because he had a theory\nabout climatic zones. The theory ran: \"All unfortunate natives are\ncriminals at heart, for the simple reason that they live south of\nlatitude 30. They are not to blame, they have not a dog's chance   we\nshould be like them if we settled here.\" Born at Karachi, he seemed\nto contradict his theory, and would sometimes admit as much with\na sad, quiet smile.\n\n\"Another of them found out,\" he thought, as he set to work to draft\nhis statement to the Magistrate.\n\nHe was interrupted by the arrival of Fielding.\n\nHe imparted all he knew without reservations. Miss Derek had\nherself driven in the Mudkul car about an hour ago, she and Miss\nQuested both in a terrible state. They had gone straight to his\nbungalow where he happened to be, and there and then he had taken\ndown the charge and arranged for the arrest at the railway station.\n\n\"What is the charge, precisely?\"\n\n\"That he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances.\nShe hit at him with her field-glasses; he pulled at them and the\nstrap broke, and that is how she got away. When we searched him\njust now, they were in his pocket.\"\n\n\"Oh no, oh no, no; it'll be cleared up in five minutes,\" he cried\nagain.\n\n\"Have a look at them.\"\n\nThe strap had been newly broken, the eye-piece was jammed. The\nlogic of evidence said \"Guilty.\"\n\n\"Did she say any more?\"\n\n\"There was an echo that appears to have frightened her. Did you go\ninto those caves?\"\n\n\"I saw one of them. There was an echo. Did it get on her nerves?\"\n\n\"I couldn't worry her overmuch with questions. She'll have plenty\nto go through in the witness-box. They don't bear thinking about,\nthese next weeks. I wish the Marabar Hills and all they contain\nwere at the bottom of the sea. Evening after evening one saw them\nfrom the club, and they were just a harmless name. . . . Yes, we\nstart already.\" For a visiting card was brought; Vakil Mahmoud Ali,\nlegal adviser to the prisoner, asked to be allowed to see him.\nMcBryde sighed, gave permission, and continued: \"I heard some more\nfrom Miss Derek   she is an old friend of us both and talks freely;\nwell   her account is that you went off to locate the camp, and\nalmost at once she heard stones falling on the Kawa Dol and saw\nMiss Quested running straight down the face of a precipice. Well.\nShe climbed up a sort of gully to her, and found her practically\ndone for   her helmet off      \"\n\n\"Was a guide not with her?\" interrupted Fielding.\n\n\"No. She had got among some cactuses. Miss Derek saved her life\ncoming just then   she was beginning to fling herself about. She\nhelped her down to the car. Miss Quested couldn't stand the Indian\ndriver, cried,    Keep him away'   and it was that that put our friend\non the track of what had happened. They made straight for our\nbungalow, and are there now. That's the story as far as I know it\nyet. She sent the driver to join you. I think she behaved with\ngreat sense.\"\n\n\"I suppose there's no possibility of my seeing Miss Quested?\" he\nasked suddenly.\n\n\"I hardly think that would do. Surely.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'ld say that. I should very much like to.\"\n\n\"She is in no state to see anyone. Besides, you don't know her\nwell.\"\n\n\"Hardly at all. . . . But you see I believe she's under some\nhideous delusion, and that that wretched boy is innocent.\"\n\nThe policeman started in surprise, and a shadow passed over his\nface, for he could not bear his dispositions to be upset. \"I had\nno idea that was in your mind,\" he said, and looked for support at\nthe signed deposition, which lay before him.\n\n\"Those field-glasses upset me for a minute, but I've thought since:\nit's impossible that, having attempted to assault her, he would\nput her glasses into his pocket.\"\n\n\"Quite possible, I'm afraid; when an Indian goes bad, he goes not\nonly very bad, but very queer.\"\n\n\"I don't follow.\"\n\n\"How should you? When you think of crime you think of English\ncrime. The psychology here is different. I dare say you'll tell me\nnext that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to\ngreet you. No reason he should not be. Read any of the Mutiny\nrecords; which, rather than the Bhagavad Gita, should be your Bible\nin this country. Though I'm not sure that the one and the other\nare not closely connected. Am I not being beastly? But, you see,\nFielding, as I've said to you once before, you're a schoolmaster,\nand consequently you come across these people at their best. That's\nwhat puts you wrong. They can be charming as boys. But I know them\nas they really are, after they have developed into men. Look at\nthis, for instance.\" He held up Aziz' pocket-case. \"I am going\nthrough the contents. They are not edifying. Here is a letter from\na friend who apparently keeps a brothel.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear his private letters.\"\n\n\"It'll have to be quoted in Court, as bearing on his morals. He\nwas fixing up to see women at Calcutta.\"\n\n\"Oh, that'll do, that'll do.\"\n\nMcBryde stopped, naively puzzled. It was obvious to him that any\ntwo sahibs ought to pool all they knew about any Indian, and he\ncould not think where the objection came in.\n\n\"I dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for\ndoing that, but I haven't. I did the same at his age.\"\n\nSo had the Superintendent of Police, but he considered that the\nconversation had taken a turn that was undesirable. He did not like\nFielding's next remark either.\n\n\"Miss Quested really cannot be seen? You do know that for a\ncertainty?\"\n\n\"You have never explained to me what's in your mind here. Why on\nearth do you want to see her?\"\n\n\"On the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report\nand he's committed for trial, and the whole thing goes to blazes.\nOld man, don't argue about this, but do of your goodness just ring\nup your wife or Miss Derek and enquire. It'll cost you nothing.\"\n\n\"It's no use ringing up them,\" he replied, stretching out for the\ntelephone. \"Callendar settles a question like that, of course. You\nhaven't grasped that she's seriously ill.\"\n\n\"He's sure to refuse, it's all he exists for,\" said the other\ndesperately.\n\nThe expected answer came back: the Major would not hear of the\npatient being troubled.\n\n\"I only wanted to ask her whether she is certain, dead certain,\nthat it was Aziz who followed her into the cave.\"\n\n\"Possibly my wife might ask her that much.\"\n\n\"But _I_ wanted to ask her. I want someone who believes in him to\nask her.\"\n\n\"What difference does that make?\"\n\n\"She is among people who disbelieve in Indians.\"\n\n\"Well, she tells her own story, doesn't she?\"\n\n\"I know, but she tells it to you.\"\n\nMcBryde raised his eyebrows, murmuring: \"A bit too finespun.\nAnyhow, Callendar won't hear of you seeing her. I'm sorry to say\nhe gave a bad account just now. He says that she is by no means\nout of danger.\"\n\nThey were silent. Another card was brought into the\noffice   Hamidullah's. The opposite army was gathering.\n\n\"I must put this report through now, Fielding.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't.\"\n\n\"How can I not?\"\n\n\"I feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most\ndisastrous. We are heading for a most awful smash. I can see your\nprisoner, I suppose.\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"His own people seem in touch with him all right.\"\n\n\"Well, when he's done with them.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't keep you waiting; good heavens, you take precedence of\nany Indian visitor, of course. I meant what's the good. Why mix\nyourself up with pitch?\"\n\n\"I say he's innocent      \"\n\n\"Innocence or guilt, why mix yourself up? What's the good?\"\n\n\"Oh, good, good,\" he cried, feeling that every earth was being\nstopped. \"One's got to breathe occasionally, at least I have. I\nmayn't see her, and now I mayn't see him. I promised him to come\nup here with him to you, but Turton called me off before I could\nget two steps.\"\n\n\"Sort of all-white thing the Burra Sahib would do,\" he muttered\nsentimentally. And trying not to sound patronizing, he stretched\nhis hand over the table, and said: \"We shall all have to hang\ntogether, old man, I'm afraid. I'm your junior in years, I know,\nbut very much your senior in service; you don't happen to know this\npoisonous country as well as I do, and you must take it from me\nthat the general situation is going to be nasty at Chandrapore\nduring the next few weeks, very nasty indeed.\"\n\n\"So I have just told you.\"\n\n\"But at a time like this there's no room for   well   personal views.\nThe man who doesn't toe the line is lost.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean.\"\n\n\"No, you don't see entirely. He not only loses himself, he weakens\nhis friends. If you leave the line, you leave a gap in the line.\nThese jackals\"   he pointed at the lawyers' cards   \"are looking with\nall their eyes for a gap.\"\n\n\"Can I visit Aziz?\" was his answer.\n\n\"No.\" Now that he knew of Turton's attitude, the policeman had no\ndoubts. \"You may see him on a magistrate's order, but on my own\nresponsibility I don't feel justified. It might lead to more\ncomplications.\"\n\nHe paused, reflecting that if he had been either ten years younger\nor ten years longer in India, he would have responded to McBryde's\nappeal. The bit between his teeth, he then said, \"To whom do I\napply for an order?\"\n\n\"City Magistrate.\"\n\n\"That sounds comfortable!\"\n\n\"Yes, one can't very well worry poor Heaslop.\"\n\nMore \"evidence\" appeared at this moment   the table-drawer from Aziz'\nbungalow, borne with triumph in a corporal's arms.\n\n\"Photographs of women. Ah!\"\n\n\"That's his wife,\" said Fielding, wincing.\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"He told me.\"\n\nMcBryde gave a faint, incredulous smile, and started rummaging in\nthe drawer. His face became inquisitive and slightly bestial. \"Wife\nindeed, I know those wives!\" he was thinking. Aloud he said: \"Well,\nyou must trot off now, old man, and the Lord help us, the Lord help\nus all. . .\"\n\nAs if his prayer had been heard, there was a sudden rackety-dacket\non a temple bell.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XIX\n\n\nHamidullah was the next stage. He was waiting outside the\nSuperintendent's office, and sprang up respectfully when he saw\nFielding. To the Englishman's passionate \"It's all a mistake,\" he\nanswered, \"Ah, ah, has some evidence come?\"\n\n\"It will come,\" said Fielding, holding his hand.\n\n\"Ah, yes, Mr. Fielding; but when once an Indian has been arrested,\nwe do not know where it will stop.\" His manner was deferential.\n\"You are very good to greet me in this public fashion, I appreciate\nit; but, Mr. Fielding, nothing convinces a magistrate except\nevidence. Did Mr. McBryde make any remark when my card came in? Do\nyou think my application annoyed him, will prejudice him against\nmy friend at all? If so, I will gladly retire.\"\n\n\"He's not annoyed, and if he was, what does it matter?\"\n\n\"Ah, it's all very well for you to speak like that, but we have to\nlive in this country.\"\n\nThe leading barrister of Chandrapore, with the dignified manner\nand Cambridge degree, had been rattled. He too loved Aziz, and knew\nhe was calumniated; but faith did not rule his heart, and he prated\nof \"policy\" and \"evidence\" in a way that saddened the Englishman.\nFielding, too, had his anxieties   he didn't like the field-glasses\nor the discrepancy over the guide   but he relegated them to the edge\nof his mind, and forbade them to infect its core. Aziz _was_\ninnocent, and all action must be based on that, and the people who\nsaid he was guilty were wrong, and it was hopeless to try to\npropitiate them. At the moment when he was throwing in his lot with\nIndians, he realized the profundity of the gulf that divided him\nfrom them. They always do something disappointing. Aziz had tried\nto run away from the police, Mohammed Latif had not checked the\npilfering. And now Hamidullah!   instead of raging and denouncing,\nhe temporized. Are Indians cowards? No, but they are bad starters\nand occasionally jib. Fear is everywhere; the British Raj rests on\nit; the respect and courtesy Fielding himself enjoyed were\nunconscious acts of propitiation. He told Hamidullah to cheer up,\nall would end well; and Hamidullah did cheer up, and became\npugnacious and sensible. McBryde's remark, \"If you leave the line,\nyou leave a gap in the line,\" was being illustrated.\n\n\"First and foremost, the question of bail . . .\"\n\nApplication must be made this afternoon. Fielding wanted to stand\nsurety. Hamidullah thought the Nawab Bahadur should be approached.\n\n\"Why drag in him, though?\"\n\nTo drag in everyone was precisely the barrister's aim. He then\nsuggested that the lawyer in charge of the case would be a Hindu;\nthe defence would then make a wider appeal. He mentioned one or\ntwo names   men from a distance who would not be intimidated by local\nconditions   and said he should prefer Amritrao, a Calcutta barrister,\nwho had a high reputation professionally and personally, but who\nwas notoriously anti-British.\n\nFielding demurred; this seemed to him going to the other extreme.\nAziz must be cleared, but with a minimum of racial hatred. Amritrao\nwas loathed at the club. His retention would be regarded as a\npolitical challenge.\n\n\"Oh no, we must hit with all our strength. When I saw my friend's\nprivate papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman,\nI said to myself,    Amritrao is the man to clear up this.'\"\n\nThere was a lugubrious pause. The temple bell continued to jangle\nharshly. The interminable and disastrous day had scarcely reached\nits afternoon. Continuing their work, the wheels of Dominion now\npropelled a messenger on a horse from the Superintendent to the\nMagistrate with an official report of arrest. \"Don't complicate,\nlet the cards play themselves,\" entreated Fielding, as he watched\nthe man disappear into dust. \"We're bound to win, there's nothing\nelse we can do. She will never be able to substantiate the charge.\"\n\nThis comforted Hamidullah, who remarked with complete sincerity,\n\"At a crisis, the English are really unequalled.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then, my dear Hamidullah (we must drop the    Mr.' now).\nGive Aziz my love when you see him, and tell him to keep calm,\ncalm, calm. I shall go back to the College now. If you want me,\nring me up; if you don't, don't, for I shall be very busy.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear Fielding, and you actually are on our side\nagainst your own people?\"\n\n\"Yes. Definitely.\"\n\nHe regretted taking sides. To slink through India unlabelled was\nhis aim. Henceforward he would be called \"anti-British,\"\n\"seditious\"   terms that bored him, and diminished his utility. He\nforesaw that besides being a tragedy, there would be a muddle;\nalready he saw several tiresome little knots, and each time his\neye returned to them, they were larger. Born in freedom, he was\nnot afraid of muddle, but he recognized its existence.\n\nThis section of the day concluded in a queer vague talk with\nProfessor Godbole. The interminable affair of the Russell's Viper\nwas again in question. Some weeks before, one of the masters at\nthe College, an unpopular Parsi, had found a Russell's Viper nosing\nround his class-room. Perhaps it had crawled in of itself, but\nperhaps it had not, and the staff still continued to interview\ntheir Principal about it, and to take up his time with their\ntheories. The reptile is so poisonous that he did not like to cut\nthem short, and this they knew. Thus when his mind was bursting\nwith other troubles and he was debating whether he should compose\na letter of appeal to Miss Quested, he was obliged to listen to a\nspeech which lacked both basis and conclusion, and floated through\nair. At the end of it Godbole said, \"May I now take my leave?\"   always\nan indication that he had not come to his point yet. \"Now I take\nmy leave, I must tell you how glad I am to hear that after all you\nsucceeded in reaching the Marabar. I feared my unpunctuality had\nprevented you, but you went (a far pleasanter method) in Miss\nDerek's car. I hope the expedition was a successful one.\"\n\n\"The news has not reached you yet, I can see.\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"No; there has been a terrible catastrophe about Aziz.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. That is all round the College.\"\n\n\"Well, the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a\nsuccessful one,\" said Fielding, with an amazed stare.\n\n\"I cannot say. I was not present.\"\n\nHe stared again   a most useless operation, for no eye could see what\nlay at the bottom of the Brahman's mind, and yet he had a mind and\na heart too, and all his friends trusted him, without knowing why.\n\"I am most frightfully cut up,\" he said.\n\n\"So I saw at once on entering your office. I must not detain you,\nbut I have a small private difficulty on which I want your help;\nI am leaving your service shortly, as you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, alas!\"\n\n\"And am returning to my birthplace in Central India to take charge\nof education there. I want to start a High School there on sound\nEnglish lines, that shall be as like Government College as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Well?\" he sighed, trying to take an interest.\n\n\"At present there is only vernacular education at Mau. I shall feel\nit my duty to change all that. I shall advise His Highness to\nsanction at least a High School in the Capital, and if possible\nanother in each pargana.\"\n\nFielding sunk his head on his arms; really, Indians were sometimes\nunbearable.\n\n\"The point   the point on which I desire your help is this: what name\nshould be given to the school?\"\n\n\"A name? A name for a school?\" he said, feeling sickish suddenly,\nas he had done in the waiting-room.\n\n\"Yes, a name, a suitable title, by which it can be called, by which\nit may be generally known.\"\n\n\"Really   I have no names for schools in my head. I can think of\nnothing but our poor Aziz. Have you grasped that at the present\nmoment he is in prison?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Oh no, I do not expect an answer to my question now. I\nonly meant that when you are at leisure, you might think the matter\nover, and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools. I\nhad thought of the    Mr. Fielding High School,' but failing that,\nthe    King-Emperor George the Fifth.'\"\n\n\"Godbole!\"\n\nThe old fellow put his hands together, and looked sly and charming.\n\n\"Is Aziz innocent or guilty?\"\n\n\"That is for the Court to decide. The verdict will be in strict\naccordance with the evidence, I make no doubt.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but your personal opinion. Here's a man we both like,\ngenerally esteemed; he lives here quietly doing his work. Well,\nwhat's one to make of it? Would he or would he not do such a\nthing?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is rather a different question from your previous one,\nand also more difficult: I mean difficult in our philosophy. Dr.\nAziz is a most worthy young man, I have a great regard for him;\nbut I think you are asking me whether the individual can commit\ngood actions or evil actions, and that is rather difficult for us.\"\nHe spoke without emotion and in short tripping syllables.\n\n\"I ask you: did he do it or not? Is that plain? I know he didn't,\nand from that I start. I mean to get at the true explanation in a\ncouple of days. My last notion is that it's the guide who went\nround with them. Malice on Miss Quested's part   it couldn't be that,\nthough Hamidullah thinks so. She has certainly had some appalling\nexperience. But you tell me, oh no   because good and evil are the\nsame.\"\n\n\"No, not exactly, please, according to our philosophy. Because\nnothing can be performed in isolation. All perform a good action,\nwhen one is performed, and when an evil action is performed, all\nperform it. To illustrate my meaning, let me take the case in point\nas an example.\"\n\n\"I am informed that an evil action was performed in the Marabar\nHills, and that a highly esteemed English lady is now seriously\nill in consequence. My answer to that is this: that action was\nperformed by Dr. Aziz.\" He stopped and sucked in his thin cheeks.\n\"It was performed by the guide.\" He stopped again. \"It was performed\nby you.\" Now he had an air of daring and of coyness. \"It was\nperformed by me.\" He looked shyly down the sleeve of his own coat.\n\"And by my students. It was even performed by the lady herself.\nWhen evil occurs, it expresses the whole of the universe. Similarly\nwhen good occurs.\"\n\n\"And similarly when suffering occurs, and so on and so forth, and\neverything is anything and nothing something,\" he muttered in his\nirritation, for he needed the solid ground.\n\n\"Excuse me, you are now again changing the basis of our discussion.\nWe were discussing good and evil. Suffering is merely a matter for\nthe individual. If a young lady has sunstroke, that is a matter of\nno significance to the universe. Oh no, not at all. Oh no, not the\nleast. It is an isolated matter, it only concerns herself. If she\nthought her head did not ache, she would not be ill, and that would\nend it. But it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil. They\nare not what we think them, they are what they are, and each of us\nhas contributed to both.\"\n\n\"You're preaching that evil and good are the same.\"\n\n\"Oh no, excuse me once again. Good and evil are different, as their\nnames imply. But, in my own humble opinion, they are both of them\naspects of my Lord. He is present in the one, absent in the other,\nand the difference between presence and absence is great, as great\nas my feeble mind can grasp. Yet absence implies presence, absence\nis not non-existence, and we are therefore entitled to repeat,\n   Come, come, come, come.'\" And in the same breath, as if to cancel\nany beauty his words might have contained, he added, \"But did you\nhave time to visit any of the interesting Marabar antiquities?\"\n\nFielding was silent, trying to meditate and rest his brain.\n\n\"Did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground?\" he\nnagged.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he answered distractedly, wandering over half a dozen\nthings at once.\n\n\"That is good, then you saw the Tank of the Dagger.\" And he related\na legend which might have been acceptable if he had told it at the\ntea-party a fortnight ago. It concerned a Hindu Rajah who had slain\nhis own sister's son, and the dagger with which he performed the\ndeed remained clamped to his hand until in the course of years he\ncame to the Marabar Hills, where he was thirsty and wanted to drink\nbut saw a thirsty cow and ordered the water to be offered to her\nfirst, which, when done, \"dagger fell from his hand, and to\ncommemorate miracle he built Tank.\" Professor Godbole's conversations\nfrequently culminated in a cow. Fielding received this one in\ngloomy silence.\n\nIn the afternoon he obtained a permit and saw Aziz, but found him\nunapproachable through misery. \"You deserted me,\" was the only\ncoherent remark. He went away to write his letter to Miss Quested.\nEven if it reached her, it would do no good, and probably the\nMcBrydes would withhold it. Miss Quested did pull him up short.\nShe was such a dry, sensible girl, and quite without malice: the\nlast person in Chandrapore wrongfully to accuse an Indian.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XX\n\n\nAlthough Miss Quested had not made herself popular with the English,\nshe brought out all that was fine in their character. For a few\nhours an exalted emotion gushed forth, which the women felt even\nmore keenly than the men, if not for so long. \"What can we do for\nour sister?\" was the only thought of Mesdames Callendar and Lesley,\nas they drove through the pelting heat to enquire. Mrs. Turton was\nthe only visitor admitted to the sick-room. She came out ennobled\nby an unselfish sorrow. \"She is my own darling girl,\" were the\nwords she spoke, and then, remembering that she had called her \"not\npukka\" and resented her engagement to young Heaslop, she began to\ncry. No one had ever seen the Collector's wife cry. Capable of\ntears   yes, but always reserving them for some adequate occasion,\nand now it had come. Ah, why had they not all been kinder to the\nstranger, more patient, given her not only hospitality but their\nhearts? The tender core of the heart that is so seldom used   they\nemployed it for a little, under the stimulus of remorse. If all is\nover (as Major Callendar implied), well, all is over, and nothing\ncan be done, but they retained some responsibility in her grievous\nwrong that they couldn't define. If she wasn't one of them, they\nought to have made her one, and they could never do that now, she\nhad passed beyond their invitation. \"Why don't one think more of\nother people?\" sighed pleasure-loving Miss Derek. These regrets\nonly lasted in their pure form for a few hours. Before sunset,\nother considerations adulterated them, and the sense of guilt (so\nstrangely connected with our first sight of any suffering) had\nbegun to wear away.\n\nPeople drove into the club with studious calm   the jog-trot of\ncountry gentlefolk between green hedgerows, for the natives must\nnot suspect that they were agitated. They exchanged the usual\ndrinks, but everything tasted different, and then they looked out\nat the palisade of cactuses stabbing the purple throat of the sky;\nthey realized that they were thousands of miles from any scenery\nthat they understood. The club was fuller than usual, and several\nparents had brought their children into the rooms reserved for\nadults, which gave the air of the Residency at Lucknow. One young\nmother   a brainless but most beautiful girl   sat on a low ottoman in\nthe smoking-room with her baby in her arms; her husband was away\nin the district, and she dared not return to her bungalow in case\nthe \"niggers attacked.\" The wife of a small railway official, she\nwas generally snubbed; but this evening, with her abundant figure\nand masses of corn-gold hair, she symbolized all that is worth\nfighting and dying for; more permanent a symbol, perhaps, than poor\nAdela. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Blakiston, those drums are only Mohurram,\"\nthe men would tell her.\n\n\"Then they've started,\" she moaned, clasping the infant and rather\nwishing he would not blow bubbles down his chin at such a moment\nas this. \"No, of course not, and anyhow, they're not coming to the\nclub.\" \"And they're not coming to the Burra Sahib's bungalow\neither, my dear, and that's where you and your baby'll sleep\ntonight,\" answered Mrs. Turton, towering by her side like Pallas\nAthene, and determining in the future not to be such a snob.\n\nThe Collector clapped his hands for silence. He was much calmer\nthan when he had flown out at Fielding. He was indeed always calmer\nwhen he addressed several people than in a _t  te-  -t  te._ \"I want\nto talk specially to the ladies,\" he said. \"Not the least cause\nfor alarm. Keep cool, keep cool. Don't go out more than you can\nhelp, don't go into the city, don't talk before your servants.\nThat's all.\"\n\n\"Harry, is there any news from the city?\" asked his wife, standing\nat some distance from him, and also assuming her public-safety\nvoice. The rest were silent during the august colloquy.\n\n\"Everything absolutely normal.\"\n\n\"I had gathered as much. Those drums are merely Mohurram, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Merely the preparations for it   the Procession is not till next\nweek.\"\n\n\"Quite so, not till Monday.\"\n\n\"Mr. McBryde's down there disguised as a Holy Man,\" said Mrs.\nCallendar.\n\n\"That's exactly the sort of thing that must not be said,\" he\nremarked, pointing at her. \"Mrs. Callendar, be more careful than\nthat, please, in these times.\"\n\n\"I . . . well, I . . .\" She was not offended, his severity made\nher feel safe.\n\n\"Any more questions? Necessary questions.\"\n\n\"Is the   where is he      \" Mrs. Lesley quavered.\n\n\"Jail. Bail has been refused.\"\n\nFielding spoke next. He wanted to know whether there was an official\nbulletin about Miss Quested's health, or whether the grave reports\nwere due to gossip. His question produced a bad effect, partly\nbecause he had pronounced her name; she, like Aziz, was always\nreferred to by a periphrasis.\n\n\"I hope Callendar may be able to let us know how things are going\nbefore long.\"\n\n\"I fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary\nquestion,\" said Mrs. Turton.\n\n\"Will all ladies leave the smoking-room now, please?\" he cried,\nclapping his hands again. \"And remember what I have said. We look\nto you to help us through a difficult time, and you can help us by\nbehaving as if everything is normal. It is all I ask. Can I rely\non you?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Burra Sahib,\" they chorused out of peaked, anxious\nfaces. They moved out, subdued yet elated, Mrs. Blakiston in their\nmidst like a sacred flame. His simple words had reminded them that\nthey were an outpost of Empire. By the side of their compassionate\nlove for Adela another sentiment sprang up which was to strangle\nit in the long run. Its first signs were prosaic and small. Mrs.\nTurton made her loud, hard jokes at bridge, Mrs. Lesley began to\nknit a comforter.\n\nWhen the smoking-room was clear, the Collector sat on the edge of\na table, so that he could dominate without formality. His mind\nwhirled with contradictory impulses. He wanted to avenge Miss\nQuested and punish Fielding, while remaining scrupulously fair. He\nwanted to flog every native that he saw, but to do nothing that\nwould lead to a riot or to the necessity for military intervention.\nThe dread of having to call in the troops was vivid to him; soldiers\nput one thing straight, but leave a dozen others crooked, and they\nlove to humiliate the civilian administration. One soldier was in\nthe room this evening   a stray subaltern from a Gurkha regiment; he\nwas a little drunk, and regarded his presence as providential. The\nCollector sighed. There seemed nothing for it but the old weary\nbusiness of compromise and moderation. He longed for the good old\ndays when an Englishman could satisfy his own honour and no\nquestions asked afterwards. Poor young Heaslop had taken a step in\nthis direction, by refusing bail, but the Collector couldn't feel\nthis was wise of poor young Heaslop. Not only would the Nawab\nBahadur and others be angry, but the Government of India itself\nalso watches   and behind it is that caucus of cranks and cravens,\nthe British Parliament. He had constantly to remind himself that,\nin the eyes of the law, Aziz was not yet guilty, and the effort\nfatigued him.\n\nThe others, less responsible, could behave naturally. They had\nstarted speaking of \"women and children\"   that phrase that exempts\nthe male from sanity when it has been repeated a few times. Each\nfelt that all he loved best in the world was at stake, demanded\nrevenge, and was filled with a not unpleasing glow, in which the\nchilly and half-known features of Miss Quested vanished, and were\nreplaced by all that is sweetest and warmest in the private life.\n\"But it's the women and children,\" they repeated, and the Collector\nknew he ought to stop them intoxicating themselves, but he hadn't\nthe heart. \"They ought to be compelled to give hostages,\" etc. Many\nof the said women and children were leaving for the Hill Station\nin a few days, and the suggestion was made that they should be\npacked off at once in a special train.\n\n\"_And_ a jolly suggestion,\" the subaltern cried. \"The army's got\nto come in sooner or later. (A special train was in his mind\ninseparable from troops.) This would never have happened if Barabas\nHill was under military control. Station a bunch of Gurkhas at the\nentrance of the cave was all that was wanted.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Blakiston was saying if only there were a few Tommies,\"\nremarked someone.\n\n\"English no good,\" he cried, getting his loyalties mixed. \"Native\ntroops for this country. Give me the sporting type of native, give\nme Gurkhas, give me Rajputs, give me Jats, give me the Punjabi,\ngive me Sikhs, give me Marathas, Bhils, Afridis and Pathans, and\nreally if it comes to that, I don't mind if you give me the scums\nof the bazaars. Properly led, mind. I'd lead them anywhere      \"\n\nThe Collector nodded at him pleasantly, and said to his own people:\n\"Don't start carrying arms about. I want everything to go on\nprecisely as usual, until there's cause for the contrary. Get the\nwomenfolk off to the hills, but do it quietly, and for Heaven's\nsake no more talk of special trains. Never mind what you think or\nfeel. Possibly I have feelings too. One isolated Indian has\nattempted   is charged with an attempted crime.\" He flipped his\nforehead hard with his finger-nail, and they all realized that he\nfelt as deeply as they did, and they loved him, and determined not\nto increase his difficulties. \"Act upon that fact until there are\nmore facts,\" he concluded. \"Assume every Indian is an angel.\"\n\nThey murmured, \"Right you are, Burra Sahib. . . . Angels. . . .\nExactly. . . .\" From the subaltern: \"Exactly what I said. The\nnative's all right if you get him alone. Lesley! Lesley! You\nremember the one I had a knock with on your Maidan last month.\nWell, he was all right. Any native who plays polo is all right.\nWhat you've got to stamp on is these educated classes, and, mind,\nI do know what I'm talking about this time.\"\n\nThe smoking-room door opened, and let in a feminine buzz. Mrs.\nTurton called out, \"She's better,\" and from both sections of the\ncommunity a sigh of joy and relief rose. The Civil Surgeon, who\nhad brought the good news, came in. His cumbrous, pasty face looked\nill-tempered. He surveyed the company, saw Fielding crouched below\nhim on an ottoman, and said, \"H'm!\"\n\nEveryone began pressing him for details. \"No one's out of danger\nin this country as long as they have a temperature,\" was his\nanswer. He appeared to resent his patient's recovery, and no one\nwho knew the old Major and his ways was surprised at this.\n\n\"Squat down, Callendar; tell us all about it.\"\n\n\"Take me some time to do that.\"\n\n\"How's the old lady?\"\n\n\"Temperature.\"\n\n\"My wife heard she was sinking.\"\n\n\"So she may be. I guarantee nothing. I really can't be plagued with\nquestions, Lesley.\"\n\n\"Sorry, old man.\"\n\n\"Heaslop's just behind me.\"\n\nAt the name of Heaslop a fine and beautiful expression was renewed\non every face. Miss Quested was only a victim, but young Heaslop\nwas a martyr; he was the recipient of all the evil intended against\nthem by the country they had tried to serve; he was bearing the\nsahib's cross. And they fretted because they could do nothing for\nhim in return; they felt so craven sitting on softness and attending\nthe course of the law.\n\n\"I wish to God I hadn't given my jewel of an assistant leave. I'ld\ncut my tongue out first. To feel I'm responsible, that's what hits\nme. To refuse, and then give in under pressure. That is what I did,\nmy sons, that is what I did.\"\n\nFielding took his pipe from his mouth and looked at it thoughtfully.\nThinking him afraid, the other went on: \"I understood an Englishman\nwas to accompany the expedition. That is why I gave in.\"\n\n\"No one blames you, my dear Callendar,\" said the Collector, looking\ndown. \"We are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen\nthe expedition was insufficiently guaranteed, and stopped it. I\nknew about it myself; we lent our car this morning to take the\nladies to the station. We are all implicated in that sense, but\nnot an atom of blame attaches to you personally.\"\n\n\"I don't feel that. I wish I could. Responsibility is a very awful\nthing, and I've no use for the man who shirks it.\" His eyes were\ndirected on Fielding. Those who knew that Fielding had undertaken\nto accompany and missed the early train were sorry for him; it was\nwhat is to be expected when a man mixes himself up with natives;\nalways ends in some indignity. The Collector, who knew more, kept\nsilent, for the official in him still hoped that Fielding would\ntoe the line. The conversation turned to women and children again,\nand under its cover Major Callendar got hold of the subaltern, and\nset him on to bait the schoolmaster. Pretending to be more drunk\nthan he really was, he began to make semi-offensive remarks.\n\n\"Heard about Miss Quested's servant?\" reinforced the Major.\n\n\"No, what about him?\"\n\n\"Heaslop warned Miss Quested's servant last night never to lose\nsight of her. Prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him\nbehind. Bribed him. Heaslop has just found out the whole story,\nwith names and sums   a well-known pimp to those people gave the\nmoney, Mohammed Latif by name. So much for the servant. What about\nthe Englishman   our friend here? How did they get rid of him? Money\nagain.\"\n\nFielding rose to his feet, supported by murmurs and exclamations,\nfor no one yet suspected his integrity.\n\n\"Oh, I'm being misunderstood, apologies,\" said the Major offensively.\n\"I didn't mean they bribed Mr. Fielding.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean?\"\n\n\"They paid the other Indian to make you late   Godbole. He was saying\nhis prayers. I know those prayers!\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous . . .\" He sat down again, trembling with rage;\nperson after person was being dragged into the mud.\n\nHaving shot this bolt, the Major prepared the next. \"Heaslop also\nfound out something from his mother. Aziz paid a herd of natives\nto suffocate her in a cave. That was the end of her, or would have\nbeen only she got out. Nicely planned, wasn't it? Neat. Then he\ncould go on with the girl. He and she and a guide, provided by the\nsame Mohammed Latif. Guide now can't be found. Pretty.\" His voice\nbroke into a roar. \"It's not the time for sitting down. It's the\ntime for action. Call in the troops and clear the bazaars.\"\n\nThe Major's outbursts were always discounted, but he made everyone\nuneasy on this occasion. The crime was even worse than they had\nsupposed   the unspeakable limit of cynicism, untouched since 1857.\nFielding forgot his anger on poor old Godbole's behalf, and became\nthoughtful; the evil was propagating in every direction, it seemed\nto have an existence of its own, apart from anything that was done\nor said by individuals, and he understood better why both Aziz and\nHamidullah had been inclined to lie down and die. His adversary\nsaw that he was in trouble, and now ventured to say, \"I suppose\nnothing that's said inside the club will go outside the club?\"\nwinking the while at Lesley.\n\n\"Why should it?\" responded Lesley.\n\n\"Oh, nothing. I only heard a rumour that a certain member here\npresent has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon. You can't run\nwith the hare and hunt with the hounds, at least not in this\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Does anyone here present want to?\"\n\nFielding was determined not to be drawn again. He had something to\nsay, but it should be at his own moment. The attack failed to\nmature, because the Collector did not support it. Attention shifted\nfrom him for a time. Then the buzz of women broke out again. The\ndoor had been opened by Ronny.\n\nThe young man looked exhausted and tragic, also gentler than usual.\nHe always showed deference to his superiors, but now it came\nstraight from his heart. He seemed to appeal for their protection\nin the insult that had befallen him, and they, in instinctive\nhomage, rose to their feet. But every human act in the East is\ntainted with officialism, and while honouring him they condemned\nAziz and India. Fielding realized this, and he remained seated. It\nwas an ungracious, a caddish thing to do, perhaps an unsound thing\nto do, but he felt he had been passive long enough, and that he\nmight be drawn into the wrong current if he did not make a stand.\nRonny, who had not seen him, said in husky tones, \"Oh please   please\nall sit down, I only want to listen what has been decided.\"\n\n\"Heaslop, I'm telling them I'm against any show of force,\" said\nthe Collector apologetically. \"I don't know whether you will feel\nas I do, but that is how I am situated. When the verdict is\nobtained, it will be another matter.\"\n\n\"You are sure to know best; I have no experience, Burra Sahib.\"\n\n\"How is your mother, old boy?\"\n\n\"Better, thank you. I wish everyone would sit down.\"\n\n\"Some have never got up,\" the young soldier said.\n\n\"And the Major brings us an excellent report of Miss Quested,\"\nTurton went on.\n\n\"I do, I do, I'm satisfied.\"\n\n\"You thought badly of her earlier, did you not, Major? That's why\nI refused bail.\"\n\nCallendar laughed with friendly inwardness, and said, \"Heaslop,\nHeaslop, next time bail's wanted, ring up the old doctor before\ngiving it; his shoulders are broad, and, speaking in the strictest\nconfidence, don't take the old doctor's opinion too seriously. He's\na blithering idiot, we can always leave it at that, but he'll do\nthe little he can towards keeping in quod the      \" He broke off with\naffected politeness. \"Oh, but he has one of his friends here.\"\n\nThe subaltern called, \"Stand up, you swine.\"\n\n\"Mr. Fielding, what has prevented you from standing up?\" said the\nCollector, entering the fray at last. It was the attack for which\nFielding had waited, and to which he must reply.\n\n\"May I make a statement, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nSeasoned and self-contained, devoid of the fervours of nationality\nor youth, the schoolmaster did what was for him a comparatively\neasy thing. He stood up and said, \"I believe Dr. Aziz to be\ninnocent.\"\n\n\"You have a right to hold that opinion if you choose, but pray is\nthat any reason why you should insult Mr. Heaslop?\"\n\n\"May I conclude my statement?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I am waiting for the verdict of the courts. If he is guilty I\nresign from my service, and leave India. I resign from the club\nnow.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said voices, not entirely hostile, for they liked\nthe fellow for speaking out.\n\n\"You have not answered my question. Why did you not stand when Mr.\nHeaslop entered?\"\n\n\"With all deference, sir, I am not here to answer questions, but\nto make a personal statement, and I have concluded it.\"\n\n\"May I ask whether you have taken over charge of this District?\"\n\nFielding moved towards the door.\n\n\"One moment, Mr. Fielding. You are not to go yet, please. Before\nyou leave the club, from which you do very well to resign, you will\nexpress some detestation of the crime, and you will apologize to\nMr. Heaslop.\"\n\n\"Are you speaking to me officially, sir?\"\n\nThe Collector, who never spoke otherwise, was so infuriated that\nhe lost his head. He cried, \"Leave this room at once, and I deeply\nregret that I demeaned myself to meet you at the station. You have\nsunk to the level of your associates; you are weak, weak, that is\nwhat is wrong with you      \"\n\n\"I want to leave the room, but cannot while this gentleman prevents\nme,\" said Fielding lightly; the subaltern had got across his path.\n\n\"Let him go,\" said Ronny, almost in tears.\n\nIt was the only appeal that could have saved the situation. Whatever\nHeaslop wished must be done. There was a slight scuffle at the\ndoor, from which Fielding was propelled, a little more quickly than\nis natural, into the room where the ladies were playing cards.\n\"Fancy if I'd fallen or got angry,\" he thought. Of course he was\na little angry. His peers had never offered him violence or called\nhim weak before, besides Heaslop had heaped coals of fire on his\nhead. He wished he had not picked the quarrel over poor suffering\nHeaslop, when there were cleaner issues at hand.\n\nHowever, there it was, done, muddled through, and to cool himself\nand regain mental balance he went on to the upper verandah for a\nmoment, where the first object he saw was the Marabar Hills. At\nthis distance and hour they leapt into beauty; they were Monsalvat,\nWalhalla, the towers of a cathedral, peopled with saints and\nheroes, and covered with flowers. What miscreant lurked in them,\npresently to be detected by the activities of the law? Who was the\nguide, and had he been found yet? What was the \"echo\" of which the\ngirl complained? He did not know, but presently he would know.\nGreat is information, and she shall prevail. It was the last moment\nof the light, and as he gazed at the Marabar Hills they seemed to\nmove graciously towards him like a queen, and their charm became\nthe sky's. At the moment they vanished they were everywhere, the\ncool benediction of the night descended, the stars sparkled, and\nthe whole universe was a hill. Lovely, exquisite moment   but passing\nthe Englishman with averted face and on swift wings. He experienced\nnothing himself; it was as if someone had told him there was such\na moment, and he was obliged to believe. And he felt dubious and\ndiscontented suddenly, and wondered whether he was really and truly\nsuccessful as a human being. After forty years' experience, he had\nlearnt to manage his life and make the best of it on advanced\nEuropean lines, had developed his personality, explored his\nlimitations, controlled his passions   and he had done it all without\nbecoming either pedantic or worldly. A creditable achievement, but\nas the moment passed, he felt he ought to have been working at\nsomething else the whole time,   he didn't know at what, never would\nknow, never could know, and that was why he felt sad.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXII\n\n\nAdela lay for several days in the McBrydes' bungalow. She had been\ntouched by the sun, also hundreds of cactus spines had to be picked\nout of her flesh. Hour after hour Miss Derek and Mrs. McBryde\nexamined her through magnifying glasses, always coming on fresh\ncolonies, tiny hairs that might snap off and be drawn into the\nblood if they were neglected. She lay passive beneath their fingers,\nwhich developed the shock that had begun in the cave. Hitherto she\nhad not much minded whether she was touched or not: her senses were\nabnormally inert and the only contact she anticipated was that of\nmind. Everything now was transferred to the surface of her body,\nwhich began to avenge itself, and feed unhealthily. People seemed\nvery much alike, except that some would come close while others\nkept away. \"In space things touch, in time things part,\" she\nrepeated to herself while the thorns were being extracted   her brain\nso weak that she could not decide whether the phrase was a\nphilosophy or a pun.\n\nThey were kind to her, indeed over-kind, the men too respectful,\nthe women too sympathetic; whereas Mrs. Moore, the only visitor\nshe wanted, kept away. No one understood her trouble, or knew why\nshe vibrated between hard commonsense and hysteria. She would begin\na speech as if nothing particular had happened. \"I went into this\ndetestable cave,\" she would say dryly, \"and I remember scratching\nthe wall with my finger-nail, to start the usual echo, and then as\nI was saying there was this shadow, or sort of shadow, down the\nentrance tunnel, bottling me up. It seemed like an age, but I\nsuppose the whole thing can't have lasted thirty seconds really.\nI hit at him with the glasses, he pulled me round the cave by the\nstrap, it broke, I escaped, that's all. He never actually touched\nme once. It all seems such nonsense.\" Then her eyes would fill with\ntears. \"Naturally I'm upset, but I shall get over it.\" And then\nshe would break down entirely, and the women would feel she was\none of themselves and cry too, and men in the next room murmur:\n\"Good God, good God!\" No one realized that she thought tears vile,\na degradation more subtle than anything endured in the Marabar, a\nnegation of her advanced outlook and the natural honesty of her\nmind. Adela was always trying to \"think the incident out,\" always\nreminding herself that no harm had been done. There was \"the\nshock,\" but what is that? For a time her own logic would convince\nher, then she would hear the echo again, weep, declare she was\nunworthy of Ronny, and hope her assailant would get the maximum\npenalty. After one of these bouts, she longed to go out into the\nbazaars and ask pardon from everyone she met, for she felt in some\nvague way that she was leaving the world worse than she found it.\nShe felt that it was her crime, until the intellect, reawakening,\npointed out to her that she was inaccurate here, and set her again\nupon her sterile round.\n\nIf only she could have seen Mrs. Moore! The old lady had not been\nwell either, and was disinclined to come out, Ronny reported. And\nconsequently the echo flourished, raging up and down like a nerve\nin the faculty of her hearing, and the noise in the cave, so\nunimportant intellectually, was prolonged over the surface of her\nlife. She had struck the polished wall   for no reason   and before\nthe comment had died away, he followed her, and the climax was the\nfalling of her field-glasses. The sound had spouted after her when\nshe escaped, and was going on still like a river that gradually\nfloods the plain. Only Mrs. Moore could drive it back to its source\nand seal the broken reservoir. Evil was loose . . . she could even\nhear it entering the lives of others. . . . And Adela spent days\nin this atmosphere of grief and depression. Her friends kept up\ntheir spirits by demanding holocausts of natives, but she was too\nworried and weak to do that.\n\nWhen the cactus thorns had all been extracted, and her temperature\nfallen to normal, Ronny came to fetch her away. He was worn with\nindignation and suffering, and she wished she could comfort him;\nbut intimacy seemed to caricature itself, and the more they spoke\nthe more wretched and self-conscious they became. Practical talk\nwas the least painful, and he and McBryde now told her one or two\nthings which they had concealed from her during the crisis, by the\ndoctor's orders. She learnt for the first time of the Mohurram\ntroubles. There had nearly been a riot. The last day of the\nfestival, the great procession left its official route, and tried\nto enter the civil station, and a telephone had been cut because\nit interrupted the advance of one of the larger paper towers.\nMcBryde and his police had pulled the thing straight   a fine piece\nof work. They passed on to another and very painful subject: the\ntrial. She would have to appear in court, identify the prisoner,\nand submit to cross-examination by an Indian lawyer.\n\n\"Can Mrs. Moore be with me?\" was all she said.\n\n\"Certainly, and I shall be there myself,\" Ronny replied. \"The case\nwon't come before me; they've objected to me on personal grounds.\nIt will be at Chandrapore   we thought at one time it would be\ntransferred elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Miss Quested realizes what all that means, though,\" said McBryde\nsadly. \"The case will come before Das.\"\n\nDas was Ronny's assistant   own brother to the Mrs. Bhattacharya\nwhose carriage had played them false last month. He was courteous\nand intelligent, and with the evidence before him could only come\nto one conclusion; but that he should be judge over an English girl\nhad convulsed the station with wrath, and some of the women had\nsent a telegram about it to Lady Mellanby, the wife of the\nLieutenant-Governor.\n\n\"I must come before someone.\"\n\n\"That's   that's the way to face it. You have the pluck, Miss\nQuested.\" He grew very bitter over the arrangements, and called\nthem \"the fruits of democracy.\" In the old days an Englishwoman\nwould not have had to appear, nor would any Indian have dared to\ndiscuss her private affairs. She would have made her deposition,\nand judgment would have followed. He apologized to her for the\ncondition of the country, with the result that she gave one of her\nsudden little shoots of tears. Ronny wandered miserably about the\nroom while she cried, treading upon the flowers of the Kashmir\ncarpet that so inevitably covered it or drumming on the brass\nBenares bowls. \"I do this less every day, I shall soon be quite\nwell,\" she said, blowing her nose and feeling hideous.\n\n\"What I need is something to do. That is why I keep on with this\nridiculous crying.\"\n\n\"It's not ridiculous, we think you wonderful,\" said the policeman\nvery sincerely. \"It only bothers us that we can't help you more.\nYour stopping here   at such a time   is the greatest honour this\nhouse      \" He too was overcome with emotion. \"By the way, a letter\ncame here for you while you were ill,\" he continued. \"I opened it,\nwhich is a strange confession to make. Will you forgive me? The\ncircumstances are peculiar. It is from Fielding.\"\n\n\"Why should he write to me?\"\n\n\"A most lamentable thing has happened. The defence got hold of\nhim.\"\n\n\"He's a crank, a crank,\" said Ronny lightly.\n\n\"That's your way of putting it, but a man can be a crank without\nbeing a cad. Miss Quested had better know how he behaved to you.\nIf you don't tell her, somebody else will.\" He told her. \"He is\nnow the mainstay of the defence, I needn't add. He is the one\nrighteous Englishman in a horde of tyrants. He receives deputations\nfrom the bazaar, and they all chew betel nut and smear one another's\nhands with scent. It is not easy to enter into the mind of such a\nman. His students are on strike   out of enthusiasm for him they\nwon't learn their lessons. If it weren't for Fielding one would\nnever have had the Mohurram trouble. He has done a very grave\ndisservice to the whole community. The letter lay here a day or\ntwo, waiting till you were well enough, then the situation got so\ngrave that I decided to open it in case it was useful to us.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" she said feebly.\n\n\"Not at all. He only has the impertinence to suggest you have made\na mistake.\"\n\n\"Would that I had!\" She glanced through the letter, which was\ncareful and formal in its wording. \"Dr. Aziz is innocent,\" she\nread. Then her voice began to tremble again. \"But think of his\nbehaviour to you, Ronny. When you had already to bear so much for\nmy sake! It was shocking of him. My dear, how can I repay you? How\ncan one repay when one has nothing to give? What is the use of\npersonal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them?\nI feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and\ntry and get good. I want to begin at the beginning. All the things\nI thought I'd learnt are just a hindrance, they're not knowledge\nat all. I'm not fit for personal relationships. Well, let's go,\nlet's go. Of course Mr. Fielding's letter doesn't count; he can\nthink and write what he likes, only he shouldn't have been rude to\nyou when you had so much to bear. That's what matters. . . . I\ndon't want your arm, I'm a magnificent walker, so don't touch me,\nplease.\"\n\nMrs. McBryde wished her an affectionate good-bye   a woman with whom\nshe had nothing in common and whose intimacy oppressed her. They\nwould have to meet now, year after year, until one of their husbands\nwas superannuated. Truly Anglo-India had caught her with a\nvengeance, and perhaps it served her right for having tried to take\nup a line of her own. Humbled yet repelled, she gave thanks. \"Oh,\nwe must help one another, we must take the rough with the smooth,\"\nsaid Mrs. McBryde. Miss Derek was there too, still making jokes\nabout her comic Maharajah and Rani. Required as a witness at the\ntrial, she had refused to send back the Mudkul car; they would be\nfrightfully sick. Both Mrs. McBryde and Miss Derek kissed her, and\ncalled her by her Christian name. Then Ronny drove her back. It\nwas early in the morning, for the day, as the hot weather advanced,\nswelled like a monster at both ends, and left less and less room\nfor the movements of mortals.\n\nAs they neared his bungalow, he said: \"Mother's looking forward to\nseeing you, but of course she's old, one mustn't forget that. Old\npeople never take things as one expects, in my opinion.\" He seemed\nwarning her against approaching disappointment, but she took no\nnotice. Her friendship with Mrs. Moore was so deep and real that\nshe felt sure it would last, whatever else happened. \"What can I\ndo to make things easier for you? it's you who matter,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Dear old girl to say so.\"\n\n\"Dear old boy.\" Then she cried: \"Ronny, she isn't ill too?\"\n\nHe reassured her; Major Callendar was not dissatisfied.\n\n\"But you'll find her   irritable. We are an irritable family. Well,\nyou'll see for yourself. No doubt my own nerves are out of order,\nand I expected more from mother when I came in from the office than\nshe felt able to give. She is sure to make a special effort for\nyou; still, I don't want your home-coming to be a disappointing\none. Don't expect too much.\"\n\nThe house came in sight. It was a replica of the bungalow she had\nleft. Puffy, red, and curiously severe, Mrs. Moore was revealed\nupon a sofa. She didn't get up when they entered, and the surprise\nof this roused Adela from her own troubles.\n\n\"Here you are both back,\" was the only greeting.\n\nAdela sat down and took her hand. It withdrew, and she felt that\njust as others repelled her, so did she repel Mrs. Moore.\n\n\"Are you all right? You appeared all right when I left,\" said\nRonny, trying not to speak crossly, but he had instructed her to\ngive the girl a pleasant welcome, and he could not but feel annoyed.\n\n\"I am all right,\" she said heavily. \"As a matter of fact I have\nbeen looking at my return ticket. It is interchangeable, so I have\na much larger choice of boats home than I thought.\"\n\n\"We can go into that later, can't we?\"\n\n\"Ralph and Stella may be wanting to know when I arrive.\"\n\n\"There is plenty of time for all such plans. How do you think our\nAdela looks?\"\n\n\"I am counting on you to help me through; it is such a blessing to\nbe with you again, everyone else is a stranger,\" said the girl\nrapidly.\n\nBut Mrs. Moore showed no inclination to be helpful. A sort of\nresentment emanated from her. She seemed to say: \"Am I to be\nbothered for ever?\" Her Christian tenderness had gone, or had\ndeveloped into a hardness, a just irritation against the human\nrace; she had taken no interest at the arrest, asked scarcely any\nquestions, and had refused to leave her bed on the awful last night\nof Mohurram, when an attack was expected on the bungalow.\n\n\"I know it's all nothing; I must be sensible, I do try      \" Adela\ncontinued, working again towards tears.\n\n\"I shouldn't mind if it had happened anywhere else; at least I\nreally don't know where it did happen.\"\n\nRonny supposed that he understood what she meant: she could not\nidentify or describe the particular cave, indeed almost refused to\nhave her mind cleared up about it, and it was recognized that the\ndefence would try to make capital out of this during the trial. He\nreassured her: the Marabar caves were notoriously like one another;\nindeed, in the future they were to be numbered in sequence with\nwhite paint.\n\n\"Yes, I mean that, at least not exactly; but there is this echo\nthat I keep on hearing.\"\n\n\"Oh, what of the echo?\" asked Mrs. Moore, paying attention to her\nfor the first time.\n\n\"I can't get rid of it.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you ever will.\"\n\nRonny had emphasized to his mother that Adela would arrive in a\nmorbid state, yet she was being positively malicious.\n\n\"Mrs. Moore, what is this echo?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"No   what is it? oh, do say! I felt you would be able to explain it\n. . . this will comfort me so. . . .\"\n\n\"If you don't know, you don't know; I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"I think you're rather unkind not to say.\"\n\n\"Say, say, say,\" said the old lady bitterly. \"As if anything can\nbe said! I have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings;\nI have listened too much. It is time I was left in peace. Not to\ndie,\" she added sourly. \"No doubt you expect me to die, but when\nI have seen you and Ronny married, and seen the other two and\nwhether they want to be married   I'll retire then into a cave of my\nown.\" She smiled, to bring down her remark into ordinary life and\nthus add to its bitterness. \"Somewhere where no young people will\ncome asking questions and expecting answers. Some shelf.\"\n\n\"Quite so, but meantime a trial is coming on,\" said her son hotly,\n\"and the notion of most of us is that we'd better pull together\nand help one another through, instead of being disagreeable. Are\nyou going to talk like that in the witness-box?\"\n\n\"Why should I be in the witness-box?\"\n\n\"To confirm certain points in our evidence.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts,\" she said,\nangry. \"I will not be dragged in at all.\"\n\n\"I won't have her dragged in, either; I won't have any more trouble\non my account,\" cried Adela, and again took the hand, which was\nagain withdrawn. \"Her evidence is not the least essential.\"\n\n\"I thought she would want to give it. No one blames you, mother,\nbut the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave, and\nencouraged Adela to go on with him alone, whereas if you'd been\nwell enough to keep on too nothing would have happened. He planned\nit, I know. Still, you fell into his trap just like Fielding and\nAntony before you. . . . Forgive me for speaking so plainly, but\nyou've no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law\ncourts. If you're ill, that's different; but you say you're all\nright and you seem so, in which case I thought you'ld want to take\nyour part, I did really.\"\n\n\"I'll not have you worry her whether she's well or ill,\" said\nAdela, leaving the sofa and taking his arm; then dropped it with\na sigh and sat down again. But he was pleased she had rallied to\nhim and surveyed his mother patronizingly. He had never felt easy\nwith her. She was by no means the dear old lady outsiders supposed,\nand India had brought her into the open.\n\n\"I shall attend your marriage, but not your trial,\" she informed\nthem, tapping her knee; she had become very restless, and rather\nungraceful. \"Then I shall go to England.\"\n\n\"You can't go to England in May, as you agreed.\"\n\n\"I have changed my mind.\"\n\n\"Well, we'd better end this unexpected wrangle,\" said the young\nman, striding about. \"You appear to want to be left out of\neverything, and that's enough.\"\n\n\"My body, my miserable body,\" she sighed. \"Why isn't it strong?\nOh, why can't I walk away and be gone? Why can't I finish my duties\nand be gone? Why do I get headaches and puff when I walk? And all\nthe time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and\nthat to do in her way, and everything sympathy and confusion and\nbearing one another's burdens. Why can't this be done and that be\ndone in my way and they be done and I at peace? Why has anything\nto be done, I cannot see. Why all this marriage, marriage? . . .\nThe human race would have become a single person centuries ago if\nmarriage was any use. And all this rubbish about love, love in a\nchurch, love in a cave, as if there is the least difference, and\nI held up from my business over such trifles!\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" he said, exasperated. \"Can you state it in\nsimple language? If so, do.\"\n\n\"I want my pack of patience cards.\"\n\n\"Very well, get them.\"\n\nHe found, as he expected, that the poor girl was crying. And, as\nalways, an Indian close outside the window, a mali in this case,\npicking up sounds. Much upset, he sat silent for a moment, thinking\nover his mother and her senile intrusions. He wished he had never\nasked her to visit India, or become under any obligation to her.\n\n\"Well, my dear girl, this isn't much of a home-coming,\" he said at\nlast. \"I had no idea she had this up her sleeve.\"\n\nAdela had stopped crying. An extraordinary expression was on her\nface, half relief, half horror. She repeated, \"Aziz, Aziz.\"\n\nThey all avoided mentioning that name. It had become synonymous\nwith the power of evil. He was \"the prisoner,\" \"the person in\nquestion,\" \"the defence,\" and the sound of it now rang out like\nthe first note of new symphony.\n\n\"Aziz . . . have I made a mistake?\"\n\n\"You're over-tired,\" he cried, not much surprised.\n\n\"Ronny, he's innocent; I made an awful mistake.\"\n\n\"Well, sit down anyhow.\" He looked round the room, but only two\nsparrows were chasing one another. She obeyed and took hold of his\nhand. He stroked it and she smiled, and gasped as if she had risen\nto the surface of the water, then touched her ear.\n\n\"My echo's better.\"\n\n\"That's good. You'll be perfectly well in a few days, but you must\nsave yourself up for the trial. Das is a very good fellow, we shall\nall be with you.\"\n\n\"But Ronny, dear Ronny, perhaps there oughtn't to be any trial.\"\n\n\"I don't quite know what you're saying, and I don't think you do.\"\n\n\"If Dr. Aziz never did it he ought to be let out.\"\n\nA shiver like impending death passed over Ronny. He said hurriedly,\n\"He was let out   until the Mohurram riot, when he had to be put in\nagain.\" To divert her, he told her the story, which was held to be\namusing. Nureddin had stolen the Nawab Bahadur's car and driven\nAziz into a ditch in the dark. Both of them had fallen out, and\nNureddin had cut his face open. Their wailing had been drowned by\nthe cries of the faithful, and it was quite a time before they were\nrescued by the police. Nureddin was taken to the Minto Hospital,\nAziz restored to prison, with an additional charge against him of\ndisturbing the public peace. \"Half a minute,\" he remarked when the\nanecdote was over, and went to the telephone to ask Callendar to\nlook in as soon as he found it convenient, because she hadn't borne\nthe journey well.\n\nWhen he returned, she was in a nervous crisis, but it took a\ndifferent form   she clung to him, and sobbed, \"Help me to do what\nI ought. Aziz is good. You heard your mother say so.\"\n\n\"Heard what?\"\n\n\"He's good; I've been so wrong to accuse him.\"\n\n\"Mother never said so.\"\n\n\"Didn't she?\" she asked, quite reasonable, open to every suggestion\nanyway.\n\n\"She never mentioned that name once.\"\n\n\"But, Ronny, I heard her.\"\n\n\"Pure illusion. You can't be quite well, can you, to make up a\nthing like that.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't. How amazing of me!\"\n\n\"I was listening to all she said, as far as it could be listened\nto; she gets very incoherent.\"\n\n\"When her voice dropped she said it   towards the end, when she\ntalked about love   love   I couldn't follow, but just then she said:\n   Doctor Aziz never did it.'\"\n\n\"Those words?\"\n\n\"The idea more than the words.\"\n\n\"Never, never, my dear girl. Complete illusion. His name was not\nmentioned by anyone. Look here   you are confusing this with\nFielding's letter.\"\n\n\"That's it, that's it,\" she cried, greatly relieved. \"I knew I'd\nheard his name somewhere. I am so grateful to you for clearing this\nup   it's the sort of mistake that worries me, and proves I'm\nneurotic.\"\n\n\"So you won't go saying he's innocent again, will you? for every\nservant I've got is a spy.\" He went to the window. The mali had\ngone, or rather had turned into two small children   impossible they\nshould know English, but he sent them packing. \"They all hate us,\"\nhe explained. \"It'll be all right after the verdict, for I will\nsay this for them, they do accept the accomplished fact; but at\npresent they're pouring out money like water to catch us tripping,\nand a remark like yours is the very thing they look out for. It\nwould enable them to say it was a put-up job on the part of us\nofficials. You see what I mean.\"\n\nMrs. Moore came back, with the same air of ill-temper, and sat down\nwith a flump by the card-table. To clear the confusion up, Ronny\nasked her point-blank whether she had mentioned the prisoner. She\ncould not understand the question and the reason of it had to be\nexplained. She replied: \"I never said his name,\" and began to play\npatience.\n\n\"I thought you said,    Aziz is an innocent man,' but it was in Mr.\nFielding's letter.\"\n\n\"Of course he is innocent,\" she answered indifferently: it was the\nfirst time she had expressed an opinion on the point.\n\n\"You see, Ronny, I was right,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You were not right, she never said it.\"\n\n\"But she thinks it.\"\n\n\"Who cares what she thinks?\"\n\n\"Red nine on black ten      \" from the card-table.\n\n\"She can think, and Fielding too, but there's such a thing as\nevidence, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I know, but      \"\n\n\"Is it again my duty to talk?\" asked Mrs. Moore, looking up.\n\"Apparently, as you keep interrupting me.\"\n\n\"Only if you have anything sensible to say.\"\n\n\"Oh, how tedious . . . trivial . . .\" and as when she had scoffed\nat love, love, love, her mind seemed to move towards them from a\ngreat distance and out of darkness. \"Oh, why is everything still\nmy duty? when shall I be free from your fuss? Was he in the cave\nand were you in the cave and on and on . . . and Unto us a Son is\nborn, unto us a Child is given . . . and am I good and is he bad\nand are we saved? . . . and ending everything the echo.\"\n\n\"I don't hear it so much,\" said Adela, moving towards her. \"You\nsend it away, you do nothing but good, you are so good.\"\n\n\"I am not good, no, bad.\" She spoke more calmly and resumed her\ncards, saying as she turned them up, \"A bad old woman, bad, bad,\ndetestable. I used to be good with the children growing up, also\nI meet this young man in his mosque, I wanted him to be happy.\nGood, happy, small people. They do not exist, they were a dream.\n. . . But I will not help you to torture him for what he never did.\nThere are different ways of evil and I prefer mine to yours.\"\n\n\"Have you any evidence in the prisoner's favour?\" said Ronny in\nthe tones of the just official. \"If so, it is your bounden duty to\ngo into the witness-box for him instead of for us. No one will stop\nyou.\"\n\n\"One knows people's characters, as you call them,\" she retorted\ndisdainfully, as if she really knew more than character but could\nnot impart it. \"I have heard both English and Indians speak well\nof him, and I felt it isn't the sort of thing he would do.\"\n\n\"Feeble, mother, feeble.\"\n\n\"Most feeble.\"\n\n\"And most inconsiderate to Adela.\"\n\nAdela said: \"It would be so appalling if I was wrong. I should take\nmy own life.\"\n\nHe turned on her with: \"What was I warning you just now? You know\nyou're right, and the whole station knows it.\"\n\n\"Yes, he . . . This is very, very awful. I'm as certain as ever he\nfollowed me . . . only, wouldn't it be possible to withdraw the\ncase? I dread the idea of giving evidence more and more, and you\nare all so good to women here and you have so much more power than\nin England   look at Miss Derek's motor-car. Oh, of course it's out\nof the question, I'm ashamed to have mentioned it; please forgive\nme.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said inadequately. \"Of course I forgive you,\nas you call it. But the case has to come before a magistrate now;\nit really must, the machinery has started.\"\n\n\"She has started the machinery; it will work to its end.\"\n\nAdela inclined towards tears in consequence of this unkind remark,\nand Ronny picked up the list of steamship sailings with an excellent\nnotion in his head. His mother ought to leave India at once: she\nwas doing no good to herself or to anyone else there.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXIII\n\n\nLady Mellanby, wife to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province,\nhad been gratified by the appeal addressed to her by the ladies of\nChandrapore. She could not do anything   besides, she was sailing\nfor England; but she desired to be informed if she could show\nsympathy in any other way. Mrs. Turton replied that Mr. Heaslop's\nmother was trying to get a passage, but had delayed too long, and\nall the boats were full; could Lady Mellanby use her influence?\nNot even Lady Mellanby could expand the dimensions of a P. and O.,\nbut she was a very, very nice woman, and she actually wired offering\nthe unknown and obscure old lady accommodation in her own reserved\ncabin. It was like a gift from heaven; humble and grateful, Ronny\ncould not but reflect that there are compensations for every woe.\nHis name was familiar at Government House owing to poor Adela, and\nnow Mrs. Moore would stamp it on Lady Mellanby's imagination, as\nthey journeyed across the Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea. He had\na return of tenderness for his mother   as we do for our relatives\nwhen they receive conspicuous and unexpected honour. She was not\nnegligible, she could still arrest the attention of a high\nofficial's wife.\n\nSo Mrs. Moore had all she wished; she escaped the trial, the\nmarriage, and the hot weather; she would return to England in\ncomfort and distinction, and see her other children. At her son's\nsuggestion, and by her own desire, she departed. But she accepted\nher good luck without enthusiasm. She had come to that state where\nthe horror of the universe and its smallness are both visible at\nthe same time   the twilight of the double vision in which so many\nelderly people are involved. If this world is not to our taste,\nwell, at all events there is Heaven, Hell, Annihilation   one or\nother of those large things, that huge scenic background of stars,\nfires, blue or black air. All heroic endeavour, and all that is\nknown as art, assumes that there is such a background, just as all\npractical endeavour, when the world is to our taste, assumes that\nthe world is all. But in the twilight of the double vision, a\nspiritual muddledom is set up for which no high-sounding words can\nbe found; we can neither act nor refrain from action, we can\nneither ignore nor respect Infinity. Mrs. Moore had always inclined\nto resignation. As soon as she landed in India it seemed to her\ngood, and when she saw the water flowing through the mosque-tank,\nor the Ganges, or the moon, caught in the shawl of night with all\nthe other stars, it seemed a beautiful goal and an easy one. To be\none with the universe! So dignified and simple. But there was\nalways some little duty to be performed first, some new card to be\nturned up from the diminishing pack and placed, and while she was\npottering about, the Marabar struck its gong.\n\nWhat had spoken to her in that scoured-out cavity of the granite?\nWhat dwelt in the first of the caves? Something very old and very\nsmall. Before time, it was before space also. Something snub-nosed,\nincapable of generosity   the undying worm itself. Since hearing its\nvoice, she had not entertained one large thought, she was actually\nenvious of Adela. All this fuss over a frightened girl! Nothing\nhad happened, \"and if it had,\" she found herself thinking with the\ncynicism of a withered priestess, \"if it had, there are worse evils\nthan love.\" The unspeakable attempt presented itself to her as\nlove: in a cave, in a church   Boum, it amounts to the same. Visions\nare supposed to entail profundity, but       Wait till you get one,\ndear reader! The abyss also may be petty, the serpent of eternity\nmade of maggots; her constant thought was: \"Less attention should\nbe paid to my future daughter-in-law and more to me, there is no\nsorrow like my sorrow,\" although when the attention was paid she\nrejected it irritably.\n\nHer son couldn't escort her to Bombay, for the local situation\ncontinued acute, and all officials had to remain at their posts.\nAntony couldn't come either, in case he never returned to give his\nevidence. So she travelled with no one who could remind her of the\npast. This was a relief. The heat had drawn back a little before\nits next advance, and the journey was not unpleasant. As she left\nChandrapore the moon, full again, shone over the Ganges and touched\nthe shrinking channels into threads of silver, then veered and\nlooked into her window. The swift and comfortable mail-train slid\nwith her through the night, and all the next day she was rushing\nthrough Central India, through landscapes that were baked and\nbleached but had not the hopeless melancholy of the plain. She\nwatched the indestructible life of man and his changing faces, and\nthe houses he has built for himself and God, and they appeared to\nher not in terms of her own trouble but as things to see. There\nwas, for instance, a place called Asirgarh which she passed at\nsunset and identified on a map   an enormous fortress among wooded\nhills. No one had ever mentioned Asirgarh to her, but it had huge\nand noble bastions and to the right of them was a mosque. She\nforgot it. Ten minutes later, Asirgarh reappeared. The mosque was\nto the left of the bastions now. The train in its descent through\nthe Vindyas had described a semicircle round Asirgarh. What could\nshe connect it with except its own name? Nothing; she knew no one\nwho lived there. But it had looked at her twice and seemed to say:\n\"I do not vanish.\" She woke in the middle of the night with a\nstart, for the train was falling over the western cliff. Moonlit\npinnacles rushed up at her like the fringes of a sea; then a brief\nepisode of plain, the real sea, and the soupy dawn of Bombay. \"I\nhave not seen the right places,\" she thought, as she saw embayed\nin the platforms of the Victoria Terminus the end of the rails that\nhad carried her over a continent and could never carry her back.\nShe would never visit Asirgarh or the other untouched places;\nneither Delhi nor Agra nor the Rajputana cities nor Kashmir, nor\nthe obscurer marvels that had sometimes shone through men's speech:\nthe bilingual rock of Girnar, the statue of Shri Belgola, the ruins\nof Mandu and Hampi, temples of Khajraha, gardens of Shalimar. As\nshe drove through the huge city which the West has built and\nabandoned with a gesture of despair, she longed to stop, though it\nwas only Bombay, and disentangle the hundred Indias that passed\neach other in its streets. The feet of the horses moved her on,\nand presently the boat sailed and thousands of coco-nut palms\nappeared all round the anchorage and climbed the hills to wave her\nfarewell. \"So you thought an echo was India; you took the Marabar\ncaves as final?\" they laughed. \"What have we in common with them,\nor they with Asirgarh? Good-bye!\" Then the steamer rounded Colaba,\nthe continent swung about, the cliff of the Ghats melted into the\nhaze of a tropic sea. Lady Mellanby turned up and advised her not\nto stand in the heat: \"We are safely out of the frying-pan,\" said\nLady Mellanby, \"it will never do to fall into the fire.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXIV\n\n\nMaking sudden changes of gear, the heat accelerated its advance\nafter Mrs. Moore's departure until existence had to be endured and\ncrime punished with the thermometer at a hundred and twelve.\nElectric fans hummed and spat, water splashed on to screens, ice\nclinked, and outside these defences, between a greyish sky and a\nyellowish earth, clouds of dust moved hesitatingly. In Europe life\nretreats out of the cold, and exquisite fireside myths have\nresulted   Balder, Persephone   but here the retreat is from the source\nof life, the treacherous sun, and no poetry adorns it because\ndisillusionment cannot be beautiful. Men yearn for poetry though\nthey may not confess it; they desire that joy shall be graceful\nand sorrow august and infinity have a form, and India fails to\naccommodate them. The annual helter-skelter of April, when\nirritability and lust spread like a canker, is one of her comments\non the orderly hopes of humanity. Fish manage better; fish, as the\ntanks dry, wriggle into the mud and wait for the rains to uncake\nthem. But men try to be harmonious all the year round, and the\nresults are occasionally disastrous. The triumphant machine of\ncivilization may suddenly hitch and be immobilized into a car of\nstone, and at such moments the destiny of the English seems to\nresemble their predecessors', who also entered the country with\nintent to refashion it, but were in the end worked into its pattern\nand covered with its dust.\n\nAdela, after years of intellectualism, had resumed her morning\nkneel to Christianity. There seemed no harm in it, it was the\nshortest and easiest cut to the unseen, and she could tack her\ntroubles on to it. Just as the Hindu clerks asked Lakshmi for an\nincrease in pay, so did she implore Jehovah for a favourable\nverdict. God who saves the King will surely support the police.\nHer deity returned a consoling reply, but the touch of her hands\non her face started prickly heat, and she seemed to swallow and\nexpectorate the same insipid clot of air that had weighed on her\nlungs all the night. Also the voice of Mrs. Turton disturbed her.\n\"Are you ready, young lady?\" it pealed from the next room.\n\n\"Half a minute,\" she murmured. The Turtons had received her after\nMrs. Moore left. Their kindness was incredible, but it was her\nposition not her character that moved them; she was the English\ngirl who had had the terrible experience, and for whom too much\ncould not be done. No one, except Ronny, had any idea of what\npassed in her mind, and he only dimly, for where there is\nofficialism every human relationship suffers. In her sadness she\nsaid to him, \"I bring you nothing but trouble; I was right on the\nMaidan, we had better just be friends,\" but he protested, for the\nmore she suffered the more highly he valued her. Did she love him?\nThis question was somehow draggled up with the Marabar, it had been\nin her mind as she entered the fatal cave. Was she capable of\nloving anyone?\n\n\"Miss Quested, Adela, what d'ye call yourself, it's half-past\nseven; we ought to think of starting for that Court when you feel\ninclined.\"\n\n\"She's saying her prayers,\" came the Collector's voice.\n\n\"Sorry, my dear; take your time. . . . Was your chhota hazri all\nright?\"\n\n\"I can't eat; might I have a little brandy?\" she asked, deserting\nJehovah.\n\nWhen it was brought, she shuddered, and said she was ready to go.\n\n\"Drink it up; not a bad notion, a peg.\"\n\n\"I don't think it'll really help me, Burra Sahib.\"\n\n\"You sent brandy down to the Court, didn't you, Mary?\"\n\n\"I should think I did, champagne too.\"\n\n\"I'll thank you this evening, I'm all to pieces now,\" said the\ngirl, forming each syllable carefully as if her trouble would\ndiminish if it were accurately defined. She was afraid of reticence,\nin case something that she herself did not perceive took shape\nbeneath it, and she had rehearsed with Mr. McBryde in an odd,\nmincing way her terrible adventure in the cave, how the man had\nnever actually touched her but dragged her about, and so on. Her\naim this morning was to announce, meticulously, that the strain\nwas appalling, and she would probably break down under Mr.\nAmritrao's cross-examination and disgrace her friends. \"My echo\nhas come back again badly,\" she told them.\n\n\"How about aspirin?\"\n\n\"It is not a headache, it is an echo.\"\n\nUnable to dispel the buzzing in her ears, Major Callendar had\ndiagnosed it as a fancy, which must not be encouraged. So the\nTurtons changed the subject. The cool little lick of the breeze\nwas passing over the earth, dividing night from day; it would fail\nin ten minutes, but they might profit by it for their drive down\ninto the city.\n\n\"I am sure to break down,\" she repeated.\n\n\"You won't,\" said the Collector, his voice full of tenderness.\n\n\"Of course she won't, she's a real sport.\"\n\n\"But Mrs. Turton . . .\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear child?\"\n\n\"If I do break down, it is of no consequence. It would matter in\nsome trials, not in this. I put it to myself in the following way:\nI can really behave as I like, cry, be absurd, I am sure to get my\nverdict, unless Mr. Das is most frightfully unjust.\"\n\n\"You're bound to win,\" he said calmly, and did not remind her that\nthere was bound to be an appeal. The Nawab Bahadur had financed\nthe defence, and would ruin himself sooner than let an \"innocent\nMoslem perish,\" and other interests, less reputable, were in the\nbackground too. The case might go up from court to court, with\nconsequences that no official could foresee. Under his very eyes,\nthe temper of Chandrapore was altering. As his car turned out of\nthe compound, there was a tap of silly anger on its paint   a pebble\nthrown by a child. Some larger stones were dropped near the mosque.\nIn the Maidan, a squad of native police on motor cycles waited to\nescort them through the bazaars. The Collector was irritated and\nmuttered, \"McBryde's an old woman\"; but Mrs. Turton said, \"Really,\nafter Mohurram a show of force will do no harm; it's ridiculous to\npretend they don't hate us, do give up that farce.\" He replied in\nan odd, sad voice, \"I don't hate them, I don't know why,\" and he\ndidn't hate them; for if he did, he would have had to condemn his\nown career as a bad investment. He retained a contemptuous affection\nfor the pawns he had moved about for so many years, they must be\nworth his pains. \"After all, it's our women who make everything\nmore difficult out here,\" was his inmost thought, as he caught\nsight of some obscenities upon a long blank wall, and beneath his\nchivalry to Miss Quested resentment lurked, waiting its day   perhaps\nthere is a grain of resentment in all chivalry. Some students had\ngathered in front of the City Magistrate's Court   hysterical boys\nwhom he would have faced if alone, but he told the driver to work\nround to the rear of the building. The students jeered, and Rafi\n(hiding behind a comrade that he might not be identified) called\nout the English were cowards.\n\nThey gained Ronny's private room, where a group of their own sort\nhad collected. None were cowardly, all nervy, for queer reports\nkept coming in. The Sweepers had just struck, and half the commodes\nof Chandrapore remained desolate in consequence   only half, and\nSweepers from the District, who felt less strongly about the\ninnocence of Dr. Aziz, would arrive in the afternoon, and break\nthe strike, but why should the grotesque incident occur? And a\nnumber of Mohammedan ladies had sworn to take no food until the\nprisoner was acquitted; their death would make little difference,\nindeed, being invisible, they seemed dead already, nevertheless it\nwas disquieting. A new spirit seemed abroad, a rearrangement, which\nno one in the stern little band of whites could explain. There was\na tendency to see Fielding at the back of it: the idea that he was\nweak and cranky had been dropped. They abused Fielding vigorously:\nhe had been seen driving up with the two counsels, Amritrao and\nMahmoud Ali; he encouraged the Boy Scout movement for seditious\nreasons; he received letters with foreign stamps on them, and was\nprobably a Japanese spy. This morning's verdict would break the\nrenegade, but he had done his country and the Empire incalculable\ndisservice. While they denounced him, Miss Quested lay back with\nher hands on the arms of her chair and her eyes closed, reserving\nher strength. They noticed her after a time, and felt ashamed of\nmaking so much noise.\n\n\"Can we do nothing for you?\" Miss Derek said.\n\n\"I don't think so, Nancy, and I seem able to do nothing for myself.\"\n\n\"But you're strictly forbidden to talk like that; you're wonderful.\"\n\n\"Yes indeed,\" came the reverent chorus.\n\n\"My old Das is all right,\" said Ronny, starting a new subject in\nlow tones.\n\n\"Not one of them's all right,\" contradicted Major Callendar.\n\n\"Das is, really.\"\n\n\"You mean he's more frightened of acquitting than convicting,\nbecause if he acquits he'll lose his job,\" said Lesley with a\nclever little laugh.\n\nRonny did mean that, but he cherished \"illusions\" about his own\nsubordinates (following the finer traditions of his service here),\nand he liked to maintain that his old Das really did possess moral\ncourage of the Public School brand. He pointed out that   from one\npoint of view   it was good that an Indian was taking the case.\nConviction was inevitable; so better let an Indian pronounce it,\nthere would be less fuss in the long run. Interested in the\nargument, he let Adela become dim in his mind.\n\n\"In fact, you disapprove of the appeal I forwarded to Lady\nMellanby,\" said Mrs. Turton with considerable heat. \"Pray don't\napologize, Mr. Heaslop; I am accustomed to being in the wrong.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that . . .\"\n\n\"All right. I said don't apologize.\"\n\n\"Those swine are always on the look-out for a grievance,\" said\nLesley, to propitiate her.\n\n\"Swine, I should think so,\" the Major echoed. \"And what's more,\nI'll tell you what. What's happened is a damn good thing really,\nbarring of course its application to present company. It'll make\nthem squeal and it's time they did squeal. I've put the fear of\nGod into them at the hospital anyhow. You should see the grandson\nof our so-called leading loyalist.\" He tittered brutally as he\ndescribed poor Nureddin's present appearance.\n\n\"His beauty's gone, five upper teeth, two lower and a nostril. . . .\nOld Panna Lal brought him the looking-glass yesterday and he\nblubbered. . . . I laughed; I laughed, I tell you, and so would\nyou; that used to be one of these buck niggers, I thought, now he's\nall septic; damn him, blast his soul   er   I believe he was unspeakably\nimmoral   er      \" He subsided, nudged in the ribs, but added, \"I wish\nI'd had the cutting up of my late assistant too; nothing's too bad\nfor these people.\"\n\n\"At last some sense is being talked,\" Mrs. Turton cried, much to\nher husband's discomfort.\n\n\"That's what I say; I say there's not such a thing as cruelty after\na thing like this.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and remember it afterwards, you men. You're weak, weak,\nweak. Why, they ought to crawl from here to the caves on their\nhands and knees whenever an Englishwoman's in sight, they oughtn't\nto be spoken to, they ought to be spat at, they ought to be ground\ninto the dust, we've been far too kind with our Bridge Parties and\nthe rest.\"\n\nShe paused. Profiting by her wrath, the heat had invaded her. She\nsubsided into a lemon squash, and continued between the sips to\nmurmur, \"Weak, weak.\" And the process was repeated. The issues Miss\nQuested had raised were so much more important than she was herself\nthat people inevitably forgot her.\n\nPresently the case was called.\n\nTheir chairs preceded them into the Court, for it was important\nthat they should look dignified. And when the chuprassies had made\nall ready, they filed into the ramshackly room with a condescending\nair, as if it was a booth at a fair. The Collector made a small\nofficial joke as he sat down, at which his entourage smiled, and\nthe Indians, who could not hear what he said, felt that some new\ncruelty was afoot, otherwise the sahibs would not chuckle.\n\nThe Court was crowded and of course very hot, and the first person\nAdela noticed in it was the humblest of all who were present, a\nperson who had no bearing officially upon the trial: the man who\npulled the punkah. Almost naked, and splendidly formed, he sat on\na raised platform near the back, in the middle of the central\ngangway, and he caught her attention as she came in, and he seemed\nto control the proceedings. He had the strength and beauty that\nsometimes come to flower in Indians of low birth. When that strange\nrace nears the dust and is condemned as untouchable, then nature\nremembers the physical perfection that she accomplished elsewhere,\nand throws out a god   not many, but one here and there, to prove to\nsociety how little its categories impress her. This man would have\nbeen notable anywhere: among the thin-hammed, flat-chested\nmediocrities of Chandrapore he stood out as divine, yet he was of\nthe city, its garbage had nourished him, he would end on its\nrubbish heaps. Pulling the rope towards him, relaxing it\nrhythmically, sending swirls of air over others, receiving none\nhimself, he seemed apart from human destinies, a male fate, a\nwinnower of souls. Opposite him, also on a platform, sat the little\nassistant magistrate, cultivated, self-conscious, and conscientious.\nThe punkah wallah was none of these things: he scarcely knew that\nhe existed and did not understand why the Court was fuller than\nusual, indeed he did not know that it was fuller than usual, didn't\neven know he worked a fan, though he thought he pulled a rope.\nSomething in his aloofness impressed the girl from middle-class\nEngland, and rebuked the narrowness of her sufferings. In virtue\nof what had she collected this roomful of people together? Her\nparticular brand of opinions, and the suburban Jehovah who\nsanctified them   by what right did they claim so much importance in\nthe world, and assume the title of civilization? Mrs. Moore   she\nlooked round, but Mrs. Moore was far away on the sea; it was the\nkind of question they might have discussed on the voyage out before\nthe old lady had turned disagreeable and queer.\n\nWhile thinking of Mrs. Moore she heard sounds, which gradually grew\nmore distinct. The epoch-making trial had started, and the\nSuperintendent of Police was opening the case for the prosecution.\n\nMr. McBryde was not at pains to be an interesting speaker; he left\neloquence to the defence, who would require it. His attitude was,\n\"Everyone knows the man's guilty, and I am obliged to say so in\npublic before he goes to the Andamans.\" He made no moral or\nemotional appeal, and it was only by degrees that the studied\nnegligence of his manner made itself felt, and lashed part of the\naudience to fury. Laboriously did he describe the genesis of the\npicnic. The prisoner had met Miss Quested at an entertainment given\nby the Principal of Government College, and had there conceived\nhis intentions concerning her: prisoner was a man of loose life,\nas documents found upon him at his arrest would testify, also his\nfellow-assistant, Dr. Panna Lal, was in a position to throw light\non his character, and Major Callendar himself would speak. Here\nMr. McBryde paused. He wanted to keep the proceedings as clean as\npossible, but Oriental Pathology, his favourite theme, lay around\nhim, and he could not resist it. Taking off his spectacles, as was\nhis habit before enunciating a general truth, he looked into them\nsadly, and remarked that the darker races are physically attracted\nby the fairer, but not _vice versa_   not a matter for bitterness\nthis, not a matter for abuse, but just a fact which any scientific\nobserver will confirm.\n\n\"Even when the lady is so uglier than the gentleman?\" The comment\nfell from nowhere, from the ceiling perhaps. It was the first\ninterruption, and the Magistrate felt bound to censure it. \"Turn\nthat man out,\" he said. One of the native policemen took hold of\na man who had said nothing, and turned him out roughly.\n\nMr. McBryde resumed his spectacles and proceeded. But the comment\nhad upset Miss Quested. Her body resented being called ugly, and\ntrembled.\n\n\"Do you feel faint, Adela?\" asked Miss Derek, who tended her with\nloving indignation.\n\n\"I never feel anything else, Nancy. I shall get through, but it's\nawful, awful.\"\n\nThis led to the first of a series of scenes. Her friends began to\nfuss around her, and the Major called out, \"I must have better\narrangements than this made for my patient; why isn't she given a\nseat on the platform? She gets no air.\"\n\nMr. Das looked annoyed and said: \"I shall be happy to accommodate\nMiss Quested with a chair up here in view of the particular\ncircumstances of her health.\" The chuprassies passed up not one\nchair but several, and the entire party followed Adela on to the\nplatform, Mr. Fielding being the only European who remained in the\nbody of the hall.\n\n\"That's better,\" remarked Mrs. Turton, as she settled herself.\n\n\"Thoroughly desirable change for several reasons,\" replied the\nMajor.\n\nThe Magistrate knew that he ought to censure this remark, but did\nnot dare to. Callendar saw that he was afraid, and called out\nauthoritatively, \"Right, McBryde, go ahead now; sorry to have\ninterrupted you.\"\n\n\"Are you all right yourselves?\" asked the Superintendent.\n\n\"We shall do, we shall do.\"\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Das, we are not here to disturb you,\" said the Collector\npatronizingly. Indeed, they had not so much disturbed the trial as\ntaken charge of it.\n\nWhile the prosecution continued, Miss Quested examined the\nhall   timidly at first, as though it would scorch her eyes. She\nobserved to left and right of the punkah man many a half-known\nface. Beneath her were gathered all the wreckage of her silly\nattempt to see India   the people she had met at the Bridge Party,\nthe man and his wife who hadn't sent their carriage, the old man\nwho would lend his car, various servants, villagers, officials,\nand the prisoner himself. There he sat   strong, neat little Indian\nwith very black hair, and pliant hands. She viewed him without\nspecial emotion. Since they last met, she had elevated him into a\nprinciple of evil, but now he seemed to be what he had always\nbeen   a slight acquaintance. He was negligible, devoid of\nsignificance, dry like a bone, and though he was \"guilty\" no\natmosphere of sin surrounded him. \"I suppose he _is_ guilty. Can\nI possibly have made a mistake?\" she thought. For this question\nstill occurred to her intellect, though since Mrs. Moore's departure\nit had ceased to trouble her conscience.\n\nPleader Mahmoud Ali now arose, and asked with ponderous and\nill-judged irony whether his client could be accommodated on the\nplatform too: even Indians felt unwell sometimes, though naturally\nMajor Callendar did not think so, being in charge of a Government\nHospital. \"Another example of their exquisite sense of humour,\"\nsang Miss Derek. Ronny looked at Mr. Das to see how he would handle\nthe difficulty, and Mr. Das became agitated, and snubbed Pleader\nMahmoud Ali severely.\n\n\"Excuse me      \" It was the turn of the eminent barrister from\nCalcutta. He was a fine-looking man, large and bony, with grey\nclosely cropped hair. \"We object to the presence of so many European\nladies and gentlemen upon the platform,\" he said in an Oxford\nvoice. \"They will have the effect of intimidating our witnesses.\nTheir place is with the rest of the public in the body of the hall.\nWe have no objection to Miss Quested remaining on the platform,\nsince she has been unwell; we shall extend every courtesy to her\nthroughout, despite the scientific truths revealed to us by the\nDistrict Superintendent of Police; but we do object to the others.\"\n\n\"Oh, cut the cackle and let's have the verdict,\" the Major growled.\n\nThe distinguished visitor gazed at the Magistrate respectfully.\n\n\"I agree to that,\" said Mr. Das, hiding his face desperately in\nsome papers. \"It was only to Miss Quested that I gave permission\nto sit up here. Her friends should be so excessively kind as to\nclimb down.\"\n\n\"Well done, Das, quite sound,\" said Ronny with devastating honesty.\n\n\"Climb down, indeed, what incredible impertinence!\" Mrs. Turton\ncried.\n\n\"Do come quietly, Mary,\" murmured her husband.\n\n\"Hi! my patient can't be left unattended.\"\n\n\"Do you object to the Civil Surgeon remaining, Mr. Amritrao?\"\n\n\"I should object. A platform confers authority.\"\n\n\"Even when it's one foot high; so come along all,\" said the\nCollector, trying to laugh.\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Mr. Das, greatly relieved. \"Thank\nyou, Mr. Heaslop; thank you ladies all.\"\n\nAnd the party, including Miss Quested, descended from its rash\neminence. The news of their humiliation spread quickly, and people\njeered outside. Their special chairs followed them. Mahmoud Ali\n(who was quite silly and useless with hatred) objected even to\nthese; by whose authority had special chairs been introduced, why\nhad the Nawab Bahadur not been given one? etc. People began to talk\nall over the room, about chairs ordinary and special, strips of\ncarpet, platforms one foot high.\n\nBut the little excursion had a good effect on Miss Quested's\nnerves. She felt easier now that she had seen all the people who\nwere in the room. It was like knowing the worst. She was sure now\nthat she should come through \"all right\"   that is to say, without\nspiritual disgrace, and she passed the good news on to Ronny and\nMrs. Turton. They were too much agitated with the defeat to British\nprestige to be interested. From where she sat, she could see the\nrenegade Mr. Fielding. She had had a better view of him from the\nplatform, and knew that an Indian child perched on his knee. He\nwas watching the proceedings, watching her. When their eyes met,\nhe turned his away, as if direct intercourse was of no interest to\nhim.\n\nThe Magistrate was also happier. He had won the battle of the\nplatform, and gained confidence. Intelligent and impartial, he\ncontinued to listen to the evidence, and tried to forget that later\non he should have to pronounce a verdict in accordance with it.\nThe Superintendent trundled steadily forward: he had expected these\noutbursts of insolence   they are the natural gestures of an inferior\nrace, and he betrayed no hatred of Aziz, merely an abysmal contempt.\n\nThe speech dealt at length with the \"prisoner's dupes,\" as they\nwere called   Fielding, the servant Antony, the Nawab Bahadur. This\naspect of the case had always seemed dubious to Miss Quested, and\nshe had asked the police not to develop it. But they were playing\nfor a heavy sentence, and wanted to prove that the assault was\npremeditated. And in order to illustrate the strategy, they produced\na plan of the Marabar Hills, showing the route that the party had\ntaken, and the \"Tank of the Dagger\" where they had camped.\n\nThe Magistrate displayed interest in arch  ology.\n\nAn elevation of a specimen cave was produced; it was lettered\n\"Buddhist Cave.\"\n\n\"Not Buddhist, I think, Jain. . . .\"\n\n\"In which cave is the offence alleged, the Buddhist or the Jain?\"\nasked Mahmoud Ali, with the air of unmasking a conspiracy.\n\n\"All the Marabar caves are Jain.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; then in which Jain cave?\"\n\n\"You will have an opportunity of putting such questions later.\"\n\nMr. McBryde smiled faintly at their fatuity. Indians invariably\ncollapse over some such point as this. He knew that the defence\nhad some wild hope of establishing an alibi, that they had tried\n(unsuccessfully) to identify the guide, and that Fielding and\nHamidullah had gone out to the Kawa Dol and paced and measured all\none moonlit night. \"Mr. Lesley says they're Buddhist, and he ought\nto know if anyone does. But may I call attention to the shape?\"\nAnd he described what had occurred there. Then he spoke of Miss\nDerek's arrival, of the scramble down the gully, of the return of\nthe two ladies to Chandrapore, and of the document Miss Quested\nsigned on her arrival, in which mention was made of the\nfield-glasses. And then came the culminating evidence: the discovery\nof the field-glasses on the prisoner. \"I have nothing to add at\npresent,\" he concluded, removing his spectacles. \"I will now call\nmy witnesses. The facts will speak for themselves. The prisoner is\none of those individuals who have led a double life. I dare say\nhis degeneracy gained upon him gradually. He has been very cunning\nat concealing, as is usual with the type, and pretending to be a\nrespectable member of society, getting a Government position even.\nHe is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption, I am afraid. He\nbehaved most cruelly, most brutally, to another of his guests,\nanother English lady. In order to get rid of her, and leave him\nfree for his crime, he crushed her into a cave among his servants.\nHowever, that is by the way.\"\n\nBut his last words brought on another storm, and suddenly a new\nname, Mrs. Moore, burst on the court like a whirlwind. Mahmoud Ali\nhad been enraged, his nerves snapped; he shrieked like a maniac,\nand asked whether his client was charged with murder as well as\nrape, and who was this second English lady.\n\n\"I don't propose to call her.\"\n\n\"You don't because you can't, you have smuggled her out of the\ncountry; she is Mrs. Moore, she would have proved his innocence,\nshe was on our side, she was poor Indians' friend.\"\n\n\"You could have called her yourself,\" cried the Magistrate. \"Neither\nside called her, neither must quote her as evidence.\"\n\n\"She was kept from us until too late   I learn too late   this is\nEnglish justice, here is your British Raj. Give us back Mrs. Moore\nfor five minutes only, and she will save my friend, she will save\nthe name of his sons; don't rule her out, Mr. Das; take back those\nwords as you yourself are a father; tell me where they have put\nher, oh, Mrs. Moore. . . .\"\n\n\"If the point is of any interest, my mother should have reached\nAden,\" said Ronny dryly; he ought not to have intervened, but the\nonslaught had startled him.\n\n\"Imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth.\" He was almost\nout of his mind, and could be heard saying above the tumult: \"I\nruin my career, no matter; we are all to be ruined one by one.\"\n\n\"This is no way to defend your case,\" counselled the Magistrate.\n\n\"I am not defending a case, nor are you trying one. We are both of\nus slaves.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mahmoud Ali, I have already warned you, and unless you sit\ndown I shall exercise my authority.\"\n\n\"Do so; this trial is a farce, I am going.\" And he handed his\npapers to Amritrao and left, calling from the door histrionically\nyet with intense passion, \"Aziz, Aziz   farewell for ever.\" The\ntumult increased, the invocation of Mrs. Moore continued, and\npeople who did not know what the syllables meant repeated them like\na charm. They became Indianized into Esmiss Esmoor, they were taken\nup in the street outside. In vain the Magistrate threatened and\nexpelled. Until the magic exhausted itself, he was powerless.\n\n\"Unexpected,\" remarked Mr. Turton.\n\nRonny furnished the explanation. Before she sailed, his mother had\ntaken to talk about the Marabar in her sleep, especially in the\nafternoon when servants were on the verandah, and her disjointed\nremarks on Aziz had doubtless been sold to Mahmoud Ali for a few\nannas: that kind of thing never ceases in the East.\n\n\"I thought they'd try something of the sort. Ingenious.\" He looked\ninto their wide-open mouths. \"They get just like over their\nreligion,\" he added calmly. \"Start and can't stop. I'm sorry for\nyour old Das, he's not getting much of a show.\"\n\n\"Mr. Heaslop, how disgraceful dragging in your dear mother,\" said\nMiss Derek, bending forward.\n\n\"It's just a trick, and they happened to pull it off. Now one sees\nwhy they had Mahmoud Ali   just to make a scene on the chance. It is\nhis speciality.\" But he disliked it more than he showed. It was\nrevolting to hear his mother travestied into Esmiss Esmoor, a Hindu\ngoddess.\n\n  \"Esmiss Esmoor\n   Esmiss Esmoor\n   Esmiss Esmoor\n   Esmiss Esmoor. . . .\"\n\n\"Ronny      \"\n\n\"Yes, old girl?\"\n\n\"Isn't it all queer.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's very upsetting for you.\"\n\n\"Not the least. I don't mind it.\"\n\n\"Well, that's good.\"\n\nShe had spoken more naturally and healthily than usual. Bending\ninto the middle of her friends, she said: \"Don't worry about me,\nI'm much better than I was; I don't feel the least faint; I shall\nbe all right, and thank you all, thank you, thank you for your\nkindness.\" She had to shout her gratitude, for the chant, Esmiss\nEsmoor, went on.\n\nSuddenly it stopped. It was as if the prayer had been heard, and\nthe relics exhibited. \"I apologize for my colleague,\" said Mr.\nAmritrao, rather to everyone's surprise. \"He is an intimate friend\nof our client, and his feelings have carried him away.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mahmoud Ali will have to apologize in person,\" the Magistrate\nsaid.\n\n\"Exactly, sir, he must. But we had just learnt that Mrs. Moore had\nimportant evidence which she desired to give. She was hurried out\nof the country by her son before she could give it; and this\nunhinged Mr. Mahmoud Ali   coming as it does upon an attempt to\nintimidate our only other European witness, Mr. Fielding. Mr.\nMahmoud Ali would have said nothing had not Mrs. Moore been claimed\nas a witness by the police.\" He sat down.\n\n\"An extraneous element is being introduced into the case,\" said\nthe Magistrate. \"I must repeat that as a witness Mrs. Moore does\nnot exist. Neither you, Mr. Amritrao, nor, Mr. McBryde, you, have\nany right to surmise what that lady would have said. She is not\nhere, and consequently she can say nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, I withdraw my reference,\" said the Superintendent wearily.\n\"I would have done so fifteen minutes ago if I had been given the\nchance. She is not of the least importance to me.\"\n\n\"I have already withdrawn it for the defence.\" He added with\nforensic humour: \"Perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside\nto withdraw it too,\" for the refrain in the street continued.\n\n\"I am afraid my powers do not extend so far,\" said Das, smiling.\n\nSo peace was restored, and when Adela came to give her evidence\nthe atmosphere was quieter than it had been since the beginning of\nthe trial. Experts were not surprised. There is no stay in your\nnative. He blazes up over a minor point, and has nothing left for\nthe crisis. What he seeks is a grievance, and this he had found in\nthe supposed abduction of an old lady. He would now be less\naggrieved when Aziz was deported.\n\nBut the crisis was still to come.\n\nAdela had always meant to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,\nand she had rehearsed this as a difficult task   difficult, because\nher disaster in the cave was connected, though by a thread, with\nanother part of her life, her engagement to Ronny. She had thought\nof love just before she went in, and had innocently asked Aziz what\nmarriage was like, and she supposed that her question had roused\nevil in him. To recount this would have been incredibly painful,\nit was the one point she wanted to keep obscure; she was willing\nto give details that would have distressed other girls, but this\nstory of her private failure she dared not allude to, and she\ndreaded being examined in public in case something came out. But\nas soon as she rose to reply, and heard the sound of her own voice,\nshe feared not even that. A new and unknown sensation protected\nher, like magnificent armour. She didn't think what had happened,\nor even remember in the ordinary way of memory, but she returned\nto the Marabar Hills, and spoke from them across a sort of darkness\nto Mr. McBryde. The fatal day recurred, in every detail, but now\nshe was of it and not of it at the same time, and this double\nrelation gave it indescribable splendour. Why had she thought the\nexpedition \"dull\"? Now the sun rose again, the elephant waited,\nthe pale masses of the rock flowed round her and presented the\nfirst cave; she entered, and a match was reflected in the polished\nwalls   all beautiful and significant, though she had been blind to\nit at the time. Questions were asked, and to each she found the\nexact reply; yes, she had noticed the \"Tank of the Dagger,\" but\nnot known its name; yes, Mrs. Moore had been tired after the first\ncave and sat in the shadow of a great rock, near the dried-up mud.\nSmoothly the voice in the distance proceeded, leading along the\npaths of truth, and the airs from the punkah behind her wafted her\non. . . .\n\n\". . . the prisoner and the guide took you on to the Kawa Dol, no\none else being present?\"\n\n\"The most wonderfully shaped of those hills. Yes.\" As she spoke,\nshe created the Kawa Dol, saw the niches up the curve of the stone,\nand felt the heat strike her face. And something caused her to add:\n\"No one else was present to my knowledge. We appeared to be alone.\"\n\n\"Very well, there is a ledge half-way up the hill, or broken ground\nrather, with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah.\"\n\n\"I know where you mean.\"\n\n\"You went alone into one of those caves?\"\n\n\"That is quite correct.\"\n\n\"And the prisoner followed you.\"\n\n\"Now we've got 'im,\" from the Major.\n\nShe was silent. The court, the place of question, awaited her\nreply. But she could not give it until Aziz entered the place of\nanswer.\n\n\"The prisoner followed you, didn't he?\" he repeated in the\nmonotonous tones that they both used; they were employing agreed\nwords throughout, so that this part of the proceedings held no\nsurprises.\n\n\"May I have half a minute before I reply to that, Mr. McBryde?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nHer vision was of several caves. She saw herself in one, and she\nwas also outside it, watching its entrance, for Aziz to pass in.\nShe failed to locate him. It was the doubt that had often visited\nher, but solid and attractive, like the hills, \"I am not      \" Speech\nwas more difficult than vision. \"I am not quite sure.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the Superintendent of Police.\n\n\"I cannot be sure . . .\"\n\n\"I didn't catch that answer.\" He looked scared, his mouth shut with\na snap. \"You are on that landing, or whatever we term it, and you\nhave entered a cave. I suggest to you that the prisoner followed\nyou.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"What do you mean, please?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said in a flat, unattractive voice. Slight noises began\nin various parts of the room, but no one yet understood what was\noccurring except Fielding. He saw that she was going to have a\nnervous breakdown and that his friend was saved.\n\n\"What is that, what are you saying? Speak up, please.\" The\nMagistrate bent forward.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have made a mistake.\"\n\n\"What nature of mistake?\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz never followed me into the cave.\"\n\nThe Superintendent slammed down his papers, then picked them up\nand said calmly: \"Now, Miss Quested, let us go on. I will read you\nthe words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my\nbungalow.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. McBryde, you cannot go on. I am speaking to the\nwitness myself. And the public will be silent. If it continues to\ntalk, I have the court cleared. Miss Quested, address your remarks\nto me, who am the Magistrate in charge of the case, and realize\ntheir extreme gravity. Remember you speak on oath, Miss Quested.\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz never      \"\n\n\"I stop these proceedings on medical grounds,\" cried the Major on\na word from Turton, and all the English rose from their chairs at\nonce, large white figures behind which the little magistrate was\nhidden. The Indians rose too, hundreds of things went on at once,\nso that afterwards each person gave a different account of the\ncatastrophe.\n\n\"You withdraw the charge? Answer me,\" shrieked the representative\nof Justice.\n\nSomething that she did not understand took hold of the girl and\npulled her through. Though the vision was over, and she had returned\nto the insipidity of the world, she remembered what she had learnt.\nAtonement and confession   they could wait. It was in hard prosaic\ntones that she said, \"I withdraw everything.\"\n\n\"Enough   sit down. Mr. McBryde, do you wish to continue in the face\nof this?\"\n\nThe Superintendent gazed at his witness as if she was a broken\nmachine, and said, \"Are you mad?\"\n\n\"Don't question her, sir; you have no longer the right.\"\n\n\"Give me time to consider      \"\n\n\"Sahib, you will have to withdraw; this becomes a scandal,\" boomed\nthe Nawab Bahadur suddenly from the back of the court.\n\n\"He shall not,\" shouted Mrs. Turton against the gathering tumult.\n\"Call the other witnesses; we're none of us safe      \" Ronny tried to\ncheck her, and she gave him an irritable blow, then screamed\ninsults at Adela.\n\nThe Superintendent moved to the support of his friends, saying\nnonchalantly to the Magistrate as he did so, \"Right, I withdraw.\"\n\nMr. Das rose, nearly dead with the strain. He had controlled the\ncase, just controlled it. He had shown that an Indian can preside.\nTo those who could hear him he said, \"The prisoner is released\nwithout one stain on his character; the question of costs will be\ndecided elsewhere.\"\n\nAnd then the flimsy framework of the court broke up, the shouts of\nderision and rage culminated, people screamed and cursed, kissed\none another, wept passionately. Here were the English, whom their\nservants protected, there Aziz fainted in Hamidullah's arms.\nVictory on this side, defeat on that   complete for one moment was\nthe antithesis. Then life returned to its complexities, person\nafter person struggled out of the room to their various purposes,\nand before long no one remained on the scene of the fantasy but\nthe beautiful naked god. Unaware that anything unusual had occurred,\nhe continued to pull the cord of his punkah, to gaze at the empty\ndais and the overturned special chairs, and rhythmically to agitate\nthe clouds of descending dust.\n\n",

Turning from them, she\nwas drawn into a mass of Indians of the shopkeeping class, and\ncarried by them towards the public exit of the court. The faint,\nindescribable smell of the bazaars invaded her, sweeter than a\nLondon slum, yet more disquieting: a tuft of scented cotton wool,\nwedged in an old man's ear, fragments of pan between his black\nteeth, odorous powders, oils   the Scented East of tradition, but\nblended with human sweat as if a great king had been entangled in\nignominy and could not free himself, or as if the heat of the sun\nhad boiled and fried all the glories of the earth into a single\nmess. They paid no attention to her. They shook hands over her\nshoulder, shouted through her body   for when the Indian does ignore\nhis rulers, he becomes genuinely unaware of their existence.\nWithout part in the universe she had created, she was flung against\nMr. Fielding.\n\n\"What do you want here?\"\n\nKnowing him for her enemy, she passed on into the sunlight without\nspeaking.\n\nHe called after her, \"Where are you going, Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You can't wander about like that. Where's the car you came in?\"\n\n\"I shall walk.\"\n\n\"What madness . . . there's supposed to be a riot on . . . the\npolice have struck, no one knows what'll happen next. Why don't\nyou keep to your own people?\"\n\n\"Ought I to join them?\" she said, without emotion. She felt emptied,\nvalueless; there was no more virtue in her.\n\n\"You can't, it's too late. How are you to get round to the private\nentrance now? Come this way with me   quick   I'll put you into my\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"Cyril, Cyril, don't leave me,\" called the shattered voice of Aziz.\n\n\"I'm coming back. . . . This way, and don't argue.\" He gripped her\narm. \"Excuse manners, but I don't know anyone's position. Send my\ncarriage back any time to-morrow, if you please.\"\n\n\"But where am I to go in it?\"\n\n\"Where you like. How should I know your arrangements?\"\n\nThe victoria was safe in a quiet side lane, but there were no\nhorses, for the sais, not expecting the trial would end so abruptly,\nhad led them away to visit a friend. She got into it obediently.\nThe man could not leave her, for the confusion increased, and spots\nof it sounded fanatical. The main road through the bazaars was\nblocked, and the English were gaining the civil station by by-ways;\nthey were caught like caterpillars, and could have been killed off\neasily.\n\n\"What   what have you been doing?\" he cried suddenly. \"Playing a\ngame, studying life, or what?\"\n\n\"Sir, I intend these for you, sir,\" interrupted a student, running\ndown the lane with a garland of jasmine on his arm.\n\n\"I don't want the rubbish; get out.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am a horse, we shall be your horses,\" another cried as he\nlifted the shafts of the victoria into the air.\n\n\"Fetch my sais, Rafi; there's a good chap.\"\n\n\"No, sir, this is an honour for us.\"\n\nFielding wearied of his students. The more they honoured him the\nless they obeyed. They lassoed him with jasmine and roses, scratched\nthe splash-board against a wall, and recited a poem, the noise of\nwhich filled the lane with a crowd.\n\n\"Hurry up, sir; we pull you in a procession.\" And, half affectionate,\nhalf impudent, they bundled him in.\n\n\"I don't know whether this suits you, but anyhow you're safe,\" he\nremarked. The carriage jerked into the main bazaar, where it\ncreated some sensation. Miss Quested was so loathed in Chandrapore\nthat her recantation was discredited, and the rumour ran that she\nhad been stricken by the Deity in the middle of her lies. But they\ncheered when they saw her sitting by the heroic Principal (some\naddressed her as Mrs. Moore!), and they garlanded her to match him.\nHalf gods, half guys, with sausages of flowers round their necks,\nthe pair were dragged in the wake of Aziz' victorious landau. In\nthe applause that greeted them some derision mingled. The English\nalways stick together! That was the criticism. Nor was it unjust.\nFielding shared it himself, and knew that if some misunderstanding\noccurred, and an attack was made on the girl by his allies, he\nwould be obliged to die in her defence. He didn't want to die for\nher, he wanted to be rejoicing with Aziz.\n\nWhere was the procession going? To friends, to enemies, to Aziz'\nbungalow, to the Collector's bungalow, to the Minto Hospital where\nthe Civil Surgeon would eat dust and the patients (confused with\nprisoners) be released, to Delhi, Simla. The students thought it\nwas going to Government College. When they reached a turning, they\ntwisted the victoria to the right, ran it by side lanes down a hill\nand through a garden gate into the mango plantation, and, as far\nas Fielding and Miss Quested were concerned, all was peace and\nquiet. The trees were full of glossy foliage and slim green fruit,\nthe tank slumbered; and beyond it rose the exquisite blue arches\nof the garden-house. \"Sir, we fetch the others; sir, it is a\nsomewhat heavy load for our arms,\" were heard. Fielding took the\nrefugee to his office, and tried to telephone to McBryde. But this\nhe could not do; the wires had been cut. All his servants had\ndecamped. Once more he was unable to desert her. He assigned her\na couple of rooms, provided her with ice and drinks and biscuits,\nadvised her to lie down, and lay down himself   there was nothing\nelse to do. He felt restless and thwarted as he listened to the\nretreating sounds of the procession, and his joy was rather spoilt\nby bewilderment. It was a victory, but such a queer one.\n\nAt that moment Aziz was crying, \"Cyril, Cyril . . .\" Crammed into\na carriage with the Nawab Bahadur, Hamidullah, Mahmoud Ali, his\nown little boys, and a heap of flowers, he was not content; he\nwanted to be surrounded by all who loved him. Victory gave no\npleasure, he had suffered too much. From the moment of his arrest\nhe was done for, he had dropped like a wounded animal; he had\ndespaired, not through cowardice, but because he knew that an\nEnglishwoman's word would always outweigh his own. \"It is fate,\"\nhe said; and, \"It is fate,\" when he was imprisoned anew after\nMohurram. All that existed, in that terrible time, was affection,\nand affection was all that he felt in the first painful moments of\nhis freedom. \"Why isn't Cyril following? Let us turn back.\" But\nthe procession could not turn back. Like a snake in a drain, it\nadvanced down the narrow bazaar towards the basin of the Maidan,\nwhere it would turn about itself, and decide on its prey.\n\n\"Forward, forward,\" shrieked Mahmoud Ali, whose every utterance\nhad become a yell. \"Down with the Collector, down with the\nSuperintendent of Police.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mahmoud Ali, this is not wise,\" implored the Nawab Bahadur:\nhe knew that nothing was gained by attacking the English, who had\nfallen into their own pit and had better be left there; moreover,\nhe had great possessions and deprecated anarchy.\n\n\"Cyril, again you desert,\" cried Aziz.\n\n\"Yet some orderly demonstration is necessary,\" said Hamidullah,\n\"otherwise they will still think we are afraid.\"\n\n\"Down with the Civil Surgeon . . . rescue Nureddin.\"\n\n\"Nureddin?\"\n\n\"They are torturing him.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God . . .\"   for this, too, was a friend.\n\n\"They are not. I will not have my grandson made an excuse for an\nattack on the hospital,\" the old man protested.\n\n\"They are. Callendar boasted so before the trial. I heard through\nthe tatties; he said,    I have tortured that nigger.'\"\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God. . . . He called him a nigger, did he?\"\n\n\"They put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mahmoud Ali, impossible; a little roughness will not hurt the\nboy, he needs discipline.\"\n\n\"Pepper. Civil Surgeon said so. They hope to destroy us one by one;\nthey shall fail.\"\n\nThe new injury lashed the crowd to fury. It had been aimless\nhitherto, and had lacked a grievance. When they reached the Maidan\nand saw the sallow arcades of the Minto they shambled towards it\nhowling. It was near midday. The earth and sky were insanely ugly,\nthe spirit of evil again strode abroad. The Nawab Bahadur alone\nstruggled against it, and told himself that the rumour must be\nuntrue. He had seen his grandson in the ward only last week. But\nhe too was carried forward over the new precipice. To rescue, to\nmaltreat Major Callendar in revenge, and then was to come the turn\nof the civil station generally.\n\nBut disaster was averted, and averted by Dr. Panna Lal.\n\nDr. Panna Lal had offered to give evidence for the prosecution in\nthe hope of pleasing the English, also because he hated Aziz. When\nthe case broke down, he was in a very painful position. He saw the\ncrash coming sooner than most people, slipped from the court before\nMr. Das had finished, and drove Dapple off through the bazaars, in\nflight from the wrath to come. In the hospital he should be safe,\nfor Major Callendar would protect him. But the Major had not come,\nand now things were worse than ever, for here was a mob, entirely\ndesirous of his blood, and the orderlies were mutinous and would\nnot help him over the back wall, or rather hoisted him and let him\ndrop back, to the satisfaction of the patients. In agony he cried,\n\"Man can but die the once,\" and waddled across the compound to meet\nthe invasion, salaaming with one hand and holding up a pale yellow\numbrella in the other. \"Oh, forgive me,\" he whined as he approached\nthe victorious landau. \"Oh, Dr. Aziz, forgive the wicked lies I\ntold.\" Aziz was silent, the others thickened their throats and\nthrew up their chins in token of scorn. \"I was afraid, I was\nmislaid,\" the suppliant continued. \"I was mislaid here, there, and\neverywhere as regards your character. Oh, forgive the poor old\nhakim who gave you milk when ill! Oh, Nawab Bahadur, whoever\nmerciful, is it my poor little dispensary you require? Take every\ncursed bottle.\" Agitated, but alert, he saw them smile at his\nindifferent English, and suddenly he started playing the buffoon,\nflung down his umbrella, trod through it, and struck himself upon\nthe nose. He knew what he was doing, and so did they. There was\nnothing pathetic or eternal in the degradation of such a man. Of\nignoble origin, Dr. Panna Lal possessed nothing that could be\ndisgraced, and he wisely decided to make the other Indians feel\nlike kings, because it would put them into better tempers. When he\nfound they wanted Nureddin, he skipped like a goat, he scuttled\nlike a hen to do their bidding, the hospital was saved, and to the\nend of his life he could not understand why he had not obtained\npromotion on the morning's work. \"Promptness, sir, promptness\nsimilar to you,\" was the argument he employed to Major Callendar\nwhen claiming it.\n\nWhen Nureddin emerged, his face all bandaged, there was a roar of\nrelief as though the Bastille had fallen. It was the crisis of the\nmarch, and the Nawab Bahadur managed to get the situation into\nhand. Embracing the young man publicly, he began a speech about\nJustice, Courage, Liberty, and Prudence, ranged under heads, which\ncooled the passion of the crowd. He further announced that he\nshould give up his British-conferred title, and live as a private\ngentleman, plain Mr. Zulfiqar, for which reason he was instantly\nproceeding to his country seat. The landau turned, the crowd\naccompanied it, the crisis was over. The Marabar caves had been a\nterrible strain on the local administration; they altered a good\nmany lives and wrecked several careers, but they did not break up\na continent or even dislocate a district.\n\n\"We will have rejoicings to-night,\" the old man said. \"Mr.\nHamidullah, I depute you to bring out our friends Fielding and\nAmritrao, and to discover whether the latter will require special\nfood. The others will keep with me. We shall not go out to Dilkusha\nuntil the cool of the evening, of course. I do not know the feelings\nof other gentlemen; for my own part, I have a slight headache, and\nI wish I had thought to ask our good Panna Lal for aspirin.\"\n\nFor the heat was claiming its own. Unable to madden, it stupefied,\nand before long most of the Chandrapore combatants were asleep.\nThose in the civil station kept watch a little, fearing an attack,\nbut presently they too entered the world of dreams   that world in\nwhich a third of each man's life is spent, and which is thought by\nsome pessimists to be a premonition of eternity.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXVI\n\n\nEvening approached by the time Fielding and Miss Quested met and\nhad the first of their numerous curious conversations. He had\nhoped, when he woke up, to find someone had fetched her away, but\nthe College remained isolated from the rest of the universe. She\nasked whether she could have \"a sort of interview,\" and, when he\nmade no reply, said, \"Have you any explanation of my extraordinary\nbehaviour?\"\n\n\"None,\" he said curtly. \"Why make such a charge if you were going\nto withdraw it?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed.\"\n\n\"I ought to feel grateful to you, I suppose, but      \"\n\n\"I don't expect gratitude. I only thought you might care to hear\nwhat I have to say.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he grumbled, feeling rather schoolboyish. \"I don't\nthink a discussion between us is desirable. To put it frankly, I\nbelong to the other side in this ghastly affair.\"\n\n\"Would it not interest you to hear my side?\"\n\n\"Not much.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't tell you in confidence, of course. So you can hand on\nall my remarks to your side, for there is one great mercy that has\ncome out of all to-day's misery: I have no longer any secrets. My\necho has gone   I call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo. You see,\nI have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves, and\npossibly before it.\"\n\nThe remark interested him rather; it was what he had sometimes\nsuspected himself. \"What kind of illness?\" he enquired.\n\nShe touched her head at the side, then shook it.\n\n\"That was my first thought, the day of the arrest: hallucination.\"\n\n\"Do you think that would be so?\" she asked with great humility.\n\"What should have given me an hallucination?\"\n\n\"One of three things certainly happened in the Marabar,\" he said,\ngetting drawn into a discussion against his will. \"One of four\nthings. Either Aziz is guilty, which is what your friends think;\nor you invented the charge out of malice, which is what my friends\nthink; or you have had an hallucination. I'm very much\ninclined\"   getting up and striding about   \"now that you tell me that\nyou felt unwell before the expedition   it's an important piece of\nevidence   I believe that you yourself broke the strap of the\nfield-glasses; you were alone in that cave the whole time.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. . . .\"\n\n\"Can you remember when you first felt out of sorts?\"\n\n\"When I came to tea with you there, in that garden-house.\"\n\n\"A somewhat unlucky party. Aziz and old Godbole were both ill after\nit too.\"\n\n\"I was not ill   it is far too vague to mention: it is all mixed up\nwith my private affairs. I enjoyed the singing . . . but just about\nthen a sort of sadness began that I couldn't detect at the time . . .\nno, nothing as solid as sadness: living at half pressure\nexpresses it best. Half pressure. I remember going on to polo with\nMr. Heaslop at the Maidan. Various other things happened   it doesn't\nmatter what, but I was under par for all of them. I was certainly\nin that state when I saw the caves, and you suggest (nothing shocks\nor hurts me)   you suggest that I had an hallucination there, the\nsort of thing   though in an awful form   that makes some women think\nthey've had an offer of marriage when none was made.\"\n\n\"You put it honestly, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I was brought up to be honest; the trouble is it gets me nowhere.\"\n\nLiking her better, he smiled and said, \"It'll get us to heaven.\"\n\n\"Will it?\"\n\n\"If heaven existed.\"\n\n\"Do you not believe in heaven, Mr. Fielding, may I ask?\" she said,\nlooking at him shyly.\n\n\"I do not. Yet I believe that honesty gets us there.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Let us go back to hallucinations. I was watching you carefully\nthrough your evidence this morning, and if I'm right, the\nhallucination (what you call half pressure   quite as good a word)\ndisappeared suddenly.\"\n\nShe tried to remember what she had felt in court, but could not;\nthe vision disappeared whenever she wished to interpret it. \"Events\npresented themselves to me in their logical sequence,\" was what\nshe said, but it hadn't been that at all.\n\n\"My belief   and of course I was listening carefully, in hope you\nwould make some slip   my belief is that poor McBryde exorcised you.\nAs soon as he asked you a straightforward question, you gave a\nstraightforward answer, and broke down.\"\n\n\"Exorcise in that sense. I thought you meant I'd seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't go to that length!\"\n\n\"People whom I respect very much believe in ghosts,\" she said\nrather sharply. \"My friend Mrs. Moore does.\"\n\n\"She's an old lady.\"\n\n\"I think you need not be impolite to her, as well as to her son.\"\n\n\"I did not intend to be rude. I only meant it is difficult, as we\nget on in life, to resist the supernatural. I've felt it coming on\nme myself. I still jog on without it, but what a temptation, at\nforty-five, to pretend that the dead live again; one's own dead;\nno one else's matter.\"\n\n\"Because the dead don't live again.\"\n\n\"I fear not.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, such as often follows the triumph of\nrationalism. Then he apologized handsomely enough for his behaviour\nto Heaslop at the club.\n\n\"What does Dr. Aziz say of me?\" she asked, after another pause.\n\n\"He   he has not been capable of thought in his misery, naturally\nhe's very bitter,\" said Fielding, a little awkward, because such\nremarks as Aziz had made were not merely bitter, they were foul.\nThe underlying notion was, \"It disgraces me to have been mentioned\nin connection with such a hag.\" It enraged him that he had been\naccused by a woman who had no personal beauty; sexually, he was a\nsnob. This had puzzled and worried Fielding. Sensuality, as long\nas it is straight-forward, did not repel him, but this derived\nsensuality   the sort that classes a mistress among motor-cars if\nshe is beautiful, and among eye-flies if she isn't   was alien to\nhis own emotions, and he felt a barrier between himself and Aziz\nwhenever it arose. It was, in a new form, the old, old trouble that\neats the heart out of every civilization: snobbery, the desire for\npossessions, creditable appendages; and it is to escape this rather\nthan the lusts of the flesh that saints retreat into the Himalayas.\nTo change the subject, he said, \"But let me conclude my analysis.\nWe are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one,\nand we aren't really sure that it was an hallucination. There's a\nfourth possibility which we must touch on: was it somebody else?\"\n\n\"The guide.\"\n\n\"Exactly, the guide. I often think so. Unluckily Aziz hit him on\nthe face, and he got a fright and disappeared. It is most\nunsatisfactory, and we hadn't the police to help us, the guide was\nof no interest to them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was the guide,\" she said quietly; the question had lost\ninterest for her suddenly.\n\n\"Or could it have been one of that gang of Pathans who have been\ndrifting through the district?\"\n\n\"Someone who was in another cave, and followed me when the guide\nwas looking away? Possibly.\"\n\nAt that moment Hamidullah joined them, and seemed not too pleased\nto find them closeted together. Like everyone else in Chandrapore,\nhe could make nothing of Miss Quested's conduct. He had overheard\ntheir last remark. \"Hullo, my dear Fielding,\" he said. \"So I run\nyou down at last. Can you come out at once to Dilkusha?\"\n\n\"At once?\"\n\n\"I hope to leave in a moment, don't let me interrupt,\" said Adela.\n\n\"The telephone has been broken; Miss Quested can't ring up her\nfriends,\" he explained.\n\n\"A great deal has been broken, more than will ever be mended,\" said\nthe other. \"Still, there should be some way of transporting this\nlady back to the civil lines. The resources of civilization are\nnumerous.\" He spoke without looking at Miss Quested, and he ignored\nthe slight movement she made towards him with her hand.\n\nFielding, who thought the meeting might as well be friendly, said,\n\"Miss Quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the age of miracles has returned. One must be prepared\nfor everything, our philosophers say.\"\n\n\"It must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers,\" said Adela,\naddressing him nervously. \"The fact is that I realized before it\nwas too late that I had made a mistake, and had just enough presence\nof mind to say so. That is all my extraordinary conduct amounts\nto.\"\n\n\"All it amounts to, indeed,\" he retorted, quivering with rage but\nkeeping himself in hand, for he felt she might be setting another\ntrap. \"Speaking as a private individual, in a purely informal\nconversation, I admired your conduct, and I was delighted when our\nwarm-hearted students garlanded you. But, like Mr. Fielding, I am\nsurprised; indeed, surprise is too weak a word. I see you drag my\nbest friend into the dirt, damage his health and ruin his prospects\nin a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society\nand religion, and then suddenly you get up in the witness-box:    Oh\nno, Mr. McBryde, after all I am not quite sure, you may as well\nlet him go.' Am I mad? I keep asking myself. Is it a dream, and if\nso, when did it start? And without doubt it is a dream that has\nnot yet finished. For I gather you have not done with us yet, and\nit is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round\nthe caves.\"\n\n\"Not at all, we were only discussing possibilities,\" interposed\nFielding.\n\n\"An interesting pastime, but a lengthy one. There are one hundred\nand seventy million Indians in this notable peninsula, and of\ncourse one or other of them entered the cave. Of course some Indian\nis the culprit, we must never doubt that. And since, my dear\nFielding, these possibilities will take you some time\"   here he put\nhis arm over the Englishman's shoulder and swayed him to and fro\ngently   \"don't you think you had better come out to the Nawab\nBahadur's   or I should say to Mr. Zulfiqar's, for that is the name\nhe now requires us to call him by.\"\n\n\"Gladly, in a minute . . .\"\n\n\"I have just settled my movements,\" said Miss Quested. \"I shall go\nto the Dak Bungalow.\"\n\n\"Not the Turtons'?\" said Hamidullah, goggle-eyed. \"I thought you\nwere their guest.\"\n\nThe Dak Bungalow of Chandrapore was below the average, and certainly\nservantless. Fielding, though he continued to sway with Hamidullah,\nwas thinking on independent lines, and said in a moment: \"I have\na better idea than that, Miss Quested. You must stop here at the\nCollege. I shall be away at least two days, and you can have the\nplace entirely to yourself, and make your plans at your convenience.\"\n\n\"I don't agree at all,\" said Hamidullah, with every symptom of\ndismay. \"The idea is a thoroughly bad one. There may quite well be\nanother demonstration to-night, and suppose an attack is made on\nthe College. You would be held responsible for this lady's safety,\nmy dear fellow.\"\n\n\"They might equally attack the Dak Bungalow.\"\n\n\"Exactly, but the responsibility there ceases to be yours.\"\n\n\"Quite so. I have given trouble enough.\"\n\n\"Do you hear? The lady admits it herself. It's not an attack from\nour people I fear   you should see their orderly conduct at the\nhospital; what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged\nby the police for the purpose of discrediting you. McBryde keeps\nplenty of roughs for this purpose, and this would be the very\nopportunity for him.\"\n\n\"Never mind. She is not going to the Dak Bungalow,\" said Fielding.\nHe had a natural sympathy for the down-trodden   that was partly why\nhe rallied from Aziz   and had become determined not to leave the\npoor girl in the lurch. Also, he had a new-born respect for her,\nconsequent on their talk. Although her hard schoolmistressy manner\nremained, she was no longer examining life, but being examined by\nit; she had become a real person.\n\n\"Then where is she to go? We shall never have done with her!\" For\nMiss Quested had not appealed to Hamidullah. If she had shown\nemotion in court, broke down, beat her breast, and invoked the name\nof God, she would have summoned forth his imagination and\ngenerosity   he had plenty of both. But while relieving the Oriental\nmind, she had chilled it, with the result that he could scarcely\nbelieve she was sincere, and indeed from his standpoint she was\nnot. For her behaviour rested on cold justice and honesty; she had\nfelt, while she recanted, no passion of love for those whom she\nhad wronged. Truth is not truth in that exacting land unless there\ngo with it kindness and more kindness and kindness again, unless\nthe Word that was with God also is God. And the girl's sacrifice   so\ncreditable according to Western notions   was rightly rejected,\nbecause, though it came from her heart, it did not include her\nheart. A few garlands from students was all that India ever gave\nher in return.\n\n\"But where is she to have her dinner, where is she to sleep? I say\nhere, here, and if she is hit on the head by roughs, she is hit on\nthe head. That is my contribution. Well, Miss Quested?\"\n\n\"You are very kind. I should have said yes, I think, but I agree\nwith Mr. Hamidullah. I must give no more trouble to you. I believe\nmy best plan is to return to the Turtons, and see if they will\nallow me to sleep, and if they turn me away I must go to the Dak.\nThe Collector would take me in, I know, but Mrs. Turton said this\nmorning that she would never see me again.\" She spoke without\nbitterness, or, as Hamidullah thought, without proper pride. Her\naim was to cause the minimum of annoyance.\n\n\"Far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that\npreposterous woman.\"\n\n\"Do you find her preposterous? I used to. I don't now.\"\n\n\"Well, here's our solution,\" said the barrister, who had terminated\nhis slightly minatory caress and strolled to the window. \"Here\ncomes the City Magistrate. He comes in a third-class band-ghari\nfor purposes of disguise, he comes unattended, but here comes the\nCity Magistrate.\"\n\n\"At last,\" said Adela sharply, which caused Fielding to glance at\nher.\n\n\"He comes, he comes, he comes. I cringe. I tremble.\"\n\n\"Will you ask him what he wants, Mr. Fielding?\"\n\n\"He wants you, of course.\"\n\n\"He may not even know I'm here.\"\n\n\"I'll see him first, if you prefer.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Hamidullah said to her bitingly: \"Really, really.\nNeed you have exposed Mr. Fielding to this further discomfort? He\nis far too considerate.\" She made no reply, and there was complete\nsilence between them until their host returned.\n\n\"He has some news for you,\" he said. \"You'll find him on the\nverandah. He prefers not to come in.\"\n\n\"Does he tell me to come out to him?\"\n\n\"Whether he tells you or not, you will go, I think,\" said\nHamidullah.\n\nShe paused, then said, \"Perfectly right,\" and then said a few words\nof thanks to the Principal for his kindness to her during the day.\n\n\"Thank goodness, that's over,\" he remarked, not escorting her to\nthe verandah, for he held it unnecessary to see Ronny again.\n\n\"It was insulting of him not to come in.\"\n\n\"He couldn't very well after my behaviour to him at the Club.\nHeaslop doesn't come out badly. Besides, Fate has treated him\npretty roughly to-day. He has had a cable to the effect that his\nmother's dead, poor old soul.\"\n\n\"Oh, really. Mrs. Moore. I'm sorry,\" said Hamidullah rather\nindifferently.\n\n\"She died at sea.\"\n\n\"The heat, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Presumably.\"\n\n\"May is no month to allow an old lady to travel in.\"\n\n\"Quite so. Heaslop ought never to have let her go, and he knows\nit. Shall we be off?\"\n\n\"Let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear . . .\nthey really are intolerable dawdling there. Ah well, Fielding,\nyou don't believe in Providence, I remember. I do. This is Heaslop's\npunishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing\nour alibi.\"\n\n\"You go rather too far there. The poor old lady's evidence could\nhave had no value, shout and shriek Mahmoud Ali as he will. She\ncouldn't see through the Kawa Dol even if she had wanted to. Only\nMiss Quested could have saved him.\"\n\n\"She loved Aziz, he says, also India, and he loved her.\"\n\n\"Love is of no value in a witness, as a barrister ought to know.\nBut I see there is about to be an Esmiss Esmoor legend at\nChandrapore, my dear Hamidullah, and I will not impede its growth.\"\n\nThe other smiled, and looked at his watch. They both regretted the\ndeath, but they were middle-aged men, who had invested their\nemotions elsewhere, and outbursts of grief could not be expected\nfrom them over a slight acquaintance. It's only one's own dead who\nmatter. If for a moment the sense of communion in sorrow came to\nthem, it passed. How indeed is it possible for one human being to\nbe sorry for all the sadness that meets him on the face of the\nearth, for the pain that is endured not only by men, but by animals\nand plants, and perhaps by the stones? The soul is tired in a\nmoment, and in fear of losing the little she does understand, she\nretreats to the permanent lines which habit or chance have dictated,\nand suffers there. Fielding had met the dead woman only two or\nthree times, Hamidullah had seen her in the distance once, and they\nwere far more occupied with the coming gathering at Dilkusha, the\n\"victory\" dinner, for which they would be most victoriously late.\n\nThey agreed not to tell Aziz about Mrs. Moore till the morrow,\nbecause he was fond of her, and the bad news might spoil his fun.\n\n\"Oh, this is unbearable!\" muttered Hamidullah. For Miss Quested\nwas back again.\n\n\"Mr. Fielding, has Ronny told you of this new misfortune?\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"Ah me!\" She sat down, and seemed to stiffen into a monument.\n\n\"Heaslop is waiting for you, I think.\"\n\n\"I do so long to be alone. She was my best friend, far more to me\nthan to him. I can't bear to be with Ronny . . . I can't explain\n. . . Could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop\nafter all?\"\n\nHamidullah swore violently in the vernacular.\n\n\"I should be pleased, but does Mr. Heaslop wish it?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask him, we are too much upset   it's so complex, not like\nwhat unhappiness is supposed to be. Each of us ought to be alone,\nand think. Do come and see Ronny again.\"\n\n\"I think he should come in this time,\" said Fielding, feeling that\nthis much was due to his own dignity. \"Do ask him to come.\"\n\nShe returned with him. He was half miserable, half arrogant   indeed,\na strange mix-up   and broke at once into uneven speech. \"I came to\nbring Miss Quested away, but her visit to the Turtons has ended,\nand there is no other arrangement so far, mine are bachelor quarters\nnow      \"\n\nFielding stopped him courteously. \"Say no more, Miss Quested stops\nhere. I only wanted to be assured of your approval. Miss Quested,\nyou had better send for your own servant if he can be found, but\nI will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you, also I'll\nlet the Scouts know. They have guarded the College ever since it\nwas closed, and may as well go on. I really think you'll be as safe\nhere as anywhere. I shall be back Thursday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Hamidullah, determined to spare the enemy no incidental\npain, had said to Ronny: \"We hear, sir, that your mother has died.\nMay we ask where the cable came from?\"\n\n\"Aden.\"\n\n\"Ah, you were boasting she had reached Aden, in court.\"\n\n\"But she died on leaving Bombay,\" broke in Adela. \"She was dead\nwhen they called her name this morning. She must have been buried\nat sea.\"\n\nSomehow this stopped Hamidullah, and he desisted from his brutality,\nwhich had shocked Fielding more than anyone else. He remained\nsilent while the details of Miss Quested's occupation of the\nCollege were arranged, merely remarking to Ronny, \"It is clearly\nto be understood, sir, that neither Mr. Fielding nor any of us are\nresponsible for this lady's safety at Government College,\" to which\nRonny agreed. After that, he watched the semi-chivalrous behavings\nof the three English with quiet amusement; he thought Fielding had\nbeen incredibly silly and weak, and he was amazed by the younger\npeople's want of proper pride. When they were driving out to\nDilkusha, hours late, he said to Amritrao, who accompanied them:\n\"Mr. Amritrao, have you considered what sum Miss Quested ought to\npay as compensation?\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand rupees.\"\n\nNo more was then said, but the remark horrified Fielding. He\ncouldn't bear to think of the queer honest girl losing her money\nand possibly her young man too. She advanced into his consciousness\nsuddenly. And, fatigued by the merciless and enormous day, he lost\nhis usual sane view of human intercourse, and felt that we exist\nnot in ourselves, but in terms of each others' minds   a notion for\nwhich logic offers no support and which had attacked him only once\nbefore, the evening after the catastrophe, when from the verandah\nof the club he saw the fists and fingers of the Marabar swell until\nthey included the whole night sky.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

Exactly above their heads hung the constellation\nof the Lion, the disc of Regulus so large and bright that it\nresembled a tunnel, and when this fancy was accepted all the other\nstars seemed tunnels too.\n\n\"Are you content with our day's work, Cyril?\" the voice on his left\ncontinued.\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\n\"Except that I ate too much.    How is stomach, how head?'   I say,\nPanna Lal and Callendar 'll get the sack.\"\n\n\"There'll be a general move at Chandrapore.\"\n\n\"And you'll get promotion.\"\n\n\"They can't well move me down, whatever their feelings.\"\n\n\"In any case we spend our holidays together, and visit Kashmir,\npossibly Persia, for I shall have plenty of money. Paid to me on\naccount of the injury sustained by my character,\" he explained with\ncynical calm. \"While with me you shall never spend a single pie.\nThis is what I have always wished, and as the result of my\nmisfortunes it has come.\"\n\n\"You have won a great victory . . .\" began Fielding.\n\n\"I know, my dear chap, I know; your voice need not become so solemn\nand anxious. I know what you are going to say next: Let, oh let\nMiss Quested off paying, so that the English may say,    Here is a\nnative who has actually behaved like a gentleman; if it was not\nfor his black face we would almost allow him to join our club.'\nThe approval of your compatriots no longer interests me, I have\nbecome anti-British, and ought to have done so sooner, it would\nhave saved me numerous misfortunes.\"\n\n\"Including knowing me.\"\n\n\"I say, shall we go and pour water on to Mohammed Latif's face? He\nis so funny when this is done to him asleep.\"\n\nThe remark was not a question but a full-stop. Fielding accepted\nit as such and there was a pause, pleasantly filled by a little\nwind which managed to brush the top of the house. The banquet,\nthough riotous, had been agreeable, and now the blessings of\nleisure   unknown to the West, which either works or idles   descended\non the motley company. Civilization strays about like a ghost here,\nrevisiting the ruins of empire, and is to be found not in great\nworks of art or mighty deeds, but in the gestures well-bred Indians\nmake when they sit or lie down. Fielding, who had dressed up in\nnative costume, learnt from his excessive awkwardness in it that\nall his motions were makeshifts, whereas when the Nawab Bahadur\nstretched out his hand for food or Nureddin applauded a song,\nsomething beautiful had been accomplished which needed no\ndevelopment. This restfulness of gesture   it is the Peace that\npasseth Understanding, after all, it is the social equivalent of\nYoga. When the whirring of action ceases, it becomes visible, and\nreveals a civilization which the West can disturb but will never\nacquire. The hand stretches out for ever, the lifted knee has the\neternity though not the sadness of the grave. Aziz was full of\ncivilization this evening, complete, dignified, rather hard, and\nit was with diffidence that the other said: \"Yes, certainly you\nmust let off Miss Quested easily. She must pay all your costs, that\nis only fair, but do not treat her like a conquered enemy.\"\n\n\"Is she wealthy? I depute you to find out.\"\n\n\"The sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited   they\nwould ruin her, they are perfectly preposterous. Look here . . .\"\n\n\"I am looking, though it gets a bit dark. I see Cyril Fielding to\nbe a very nice chap indeed and my best friend, but in some ways a\nfool. You think that by letting Miss Quested off easily I shall\nmake a better reputation for myself and Indians generally. No, no.\nIt will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion\nofficially. I have decided to have nothing more to do with British\nIndia, as a matter of fact. I shall seek service in some Moslem\nState, such as Hyderabad, Bhopal, where Englishmen cannot insult\nme any more. Don't counsel me otherwise.\"\n\n\"In the course of a long talk with Miss Quested . . .\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear your long talks.\"\n\n\"Be quiet. In the course of a long talk with Miss Quested I have\nbegun to understand her character. It's not an easy one, she being\na prig. But she is perfectly genuine and very brave. When she saw\nshe was wrong, she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so. I\nwant you to realize what that means. All her friends around her,\nthe entire British Raj pushing her forward. She stops, sends the\nwhole thing to smithereens. In her place I should have funked it.\nBut she stopped, and almost did she become a national heroine, but\nmy students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught\nflame. Do treat her considerately. She really mustn't get the worst\nof both worlds. I know what all these\"   he indicated the shrouded\nforms on the roof   \"will want, but you mustn't listen to them. Be\nmerciful. Act like one of your six Mogul Emperors, or all the six\nrolled into one.\"\n\n\"Not even Mogul Emperors showed mercy until they received an\napology.\"\n\n\"She'll apologize if that's the trouble,\" he cried, sitting up.\n\"Look, I'll make you an offer. Dictate to me whatever form of words\nyou like, and this time to-morrow I'll bring it back signed. This\nis not instead of any public apology she may make you in law. It's\nan addition.\"\n\n\"   Dear Dr. Aziz, I wish you had come into the cave; I am an awful\nold hag, and it is my last chance.' Will she sign that?\"\n\n\"Well good night, good night, it's time to go to sleep, after\nthat.\"\n\n\"Good night, I suppose it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish you wouldn't make that kind of remark,\" he continued\nafter a pause. \"It is the one thing in you I can't put up with.\"\n\n\"I put up with all things in you, so what is to be done?\"\n\n\"Well, you hurt me by saying it; good night.\"\n\nThere was silence, then dreamily but with deep feeling the voice\nsaid: \"Cyril, I have had an idea which will satisfy your tender\nmind: I shall consult Mrs. Moore.\" Opening his eyes, and beholding\nthousands of stars, he could not reply, they silenced him.\n\n\"Her opinion will solve everything; I can trust her so absolutely.\nIf she advises me to pardon this girl, I shall do so. She will\ncounsel me nothing against my real and true honour, as you might.\"\n\n\"Let us discuss that to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Is it not strange? I keep on forgetting she has left India. During\nthe shouting of her name in court I fancied she was present. I had\nshut my eyes, I confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain. Now\nthis very instant I forgot again. I shall be obliged to write. She\nis now far away, well on her way towards Ralph and Stella.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To those other children.\"\n\n\"I have not heard of other children.\"\n\n\"Just as I have two boys and a girl, so has Mrs. Moore. She told\nme in the mosque.\"\n\n\"I knew her so slightly.\"\n\n\"I have seen her but three times, but I know she is an Oriental.\"\n\n\"You are so fantastic. . . . Miss Quested, you won't treat her\ngenerously; while over Mrs. Moore there is this elaborate chivalry.\nMiss Quested anyhow behaved decently this morning, whereas the old\nlady never did anything for you at all, and it's pure conjecture\nthat she would have come forward in your favour, it only rests on\nservants' gossip. Your emotions never seem in proportion to their\nobjects, Aziz.\"\n\n\"Is emotion a sack of potatoes, so much the pound, to be measured\nout? Am I a machine? I shall be told I can use up my emotions by\nusing them, next.\"\n\n\"I should have thought you could. It sounds common sense. You can't\neat your cake and have it, even in the world of the spirit.\"\n\n\"If you are right, there is no point in any friendship; it all\ncomes down to give and take, or give and return, which is\ndisgusting, and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill\nourselves. Is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow\nso materialistic?\"\n\n\"Your unfairness is worse than my materialism.\"\n\n\"I see. Anything further to complain of?\" He was good-tempered and\naffectionate but a little formidable. Imprisonment had made channels\nfor his character, which would never fluctuate as widely now as in\nthe past. \"Because it is far better you put all your difficulties\nbefore me, if we are to be friends for ever. You do not like Mrs.\nMoore, and are annoyed because I do; however, you will like her in\ntime.\"\n\nWhen a person, really dead, is supposed to be alive, an unhealthiness\ninfects the conversation. Fielding could not stand the tension any\nlonger and blurted out: \"I'm sorry to say Mrs. Moore's dead.\"\n\nBut Hamidullah, who had been listening to all their talk, and did\nnot want the festive evening spoilt, cried from the adjoining bed:\n\"Aziz, he is trying to pull your leg; don't believe him, the\nvillain.\"\n\n\"I do not believe him,\" said Aziz; he was inured to practical\njokes, even of this type.\n\nFielding said no more. Facts are facts, and everyone would learn\nof Mrs. Moore's death in the morning. But it struck him that people\nare not really dead until they are felt to be dead. As long as\nthere is some misunderstanding about them, they possess a sort of\nimmortality. An experience of his own confirmed this. Many years\nago he had lost a great friend, a woman, who believed in the\nChristian heaven, and assured him that after the changes and\nchances of this mortal life they would meet in it again. Fielding\nwas a blank, frank atheist, but he respected every opinion his\nfriend held: to do this is essential in friendship. And it seemed\nto him for a time that the dead awaited him, and when the illusion\nfaded it left behind it an emptiness that was almost guilt: \"This\nreally is the end,\" he thought, \"and I gave her the final blow.\"\nHe had tried to kill Mrs. Moore this evening, on the roof of the\nNawab Bahadur's house; but she still eluded him, and the atmosphere\nremained tranquil. Presently the moon rose   the exhausted crescent\nthat precedes the sun   and shortly after men and oxen began their\ninterminable labour, and the gracious interlude, which he had tried\nto curtail, came to its natural conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXVIII\n\n\nDead she was   committed to the deep while still on the southward\ntrack, for the boats from Bombay cannot point towards Europe until\nArabia has been rounded; she was further in the tropics than ever\nachieved while on shore, when the sun touched her for the last time\nand her body was lowered into yet another India   the Indian Ocean.\nShe left behind her sore discomfort, for a death gives a ship a\nbad name. Who was this Mrs. Moore? When Aden was reached, Lady\nMellanby cabled, wrote, did all that was kind, but the wife of a\nLieutenant-Governor does not bargain for such an experience; and\nshe repeated: \"I had only seen the poor creature for a few hours\nwhen she was taken ill; really this has been needlessly distressing,\nit spoils one's home-coming.\" A ghost followed the ship up the Red\nSea, but failed to enter the Mediterranean. Somewhere about Suez\nthere is always a social change: the arrangements of Asia weaken\nand those of Europe begin to be felt, and during the transition\nMrs. Moore was shaken off. At Port Said the grey blustery north\nbegan. The weather was so cold and bracing that the passengers felt\nit must have broken in the land they had left, but it became hotter\nsteadily there in accordance with its usual law.\n\nThe death took subtler and more lasting shapes in Chandrapore. A\nlegend sprang up that an Englishman had killed his mother for\ntrying to save an Indian's life   and there was just enough truth in\nthis to cause annoyance to the authorities. Sometimes it was a cow\nthat had been killed   or a crocodile with the tusks of a boar had\ncrawled out of the Ganges. Nonsense of this type is more difficult\nto combat than a solid lie. It hides in rubbish heaps and moves\nwhen no one is looking. At one period two distinct tombs containing\nEsmiss Esmoor's remains were reported: one by the tannery, the\nother up near the goods station. Mr. McBryde visited them both and\nsaw signs of the beginning of a cult   earthenware saucers and so\non. Being an experienced official, he did nothing to irritate it,\nand after a week or so, the rash died down. \"There's propaganda\nbehind all this,\" he said, forgetting that a hundred years ago,\nwhen Europeans still made their home in the country-side and\nappealed to its imagination, they occasionally became local demons\nafter death   not a whole god, perhaps, but part of one, adding an\nepithet or gesture to what already existed, just as the gods\ncontribute to the great gods, and they to the philosophic Brahm.\n\nRonny reminded himself that his mother had left India at her own\nwish, but his conscience was not clear. He had behaved badly to\nher, and he had either to repent (which involved a mental overturn),\nor to persist in unkindness towards her. He chose the latter\ncourse. How tiresome she had been with her patronage of Aziz! What\na bad influence upon Adela! And now she still gave trouble with\nridiculous \"tombs,\" mixing herself up with natives. She could not\nhelp it, of course, but she had attempted similar exasperating\nexpeditions in her lifetime, and he reckoned it against her. The\nyoung man had much to worry him   the heat, the local tension, the\napproaching visit of the Lieutenant-Governor, the problems of\nAdela   and threading them all together into a grotesque garland were\nthese Indianizations of Mrs. Moore. What does happen to one's\nmother when she dies? Presumably she goes to heaven, anyhow she\nclears out. Ronny's religion was of the sterilized Public School\nbrand, which never goes bad, even in the tropics. Wherever he\nentered, mosque, cave, or temple, he retained the spiritual outlook\nof the Fifth Form, and condemned as \"weakening\" any attempt to\nunderstand them. Pulling himself together, he dismissed the mater\nfrom his mind. In due time he and his half-brother and -sister\nwould put up a tablet to her in the Northamptonshire church where\nshe had worshipped, recording the dates of her birth and death and\nthe fact that she had been buried at sea. This would be sufficient.\n\nAnd Adela   she would have to depart too; he hoped she would have\nmade the suggestion herself ere now. He really could not marry\nher   it would mean the end of his career. Poor lamentable Adela. . . .\nShe remained at Government College, by Fielding's\ncourtesy   unsuitable and humiliating, but no one would receive her\nat the civil station. He postponed all private talk until the award\nagainst her was decided. Aziz was suing her for damages in the\nsub-judge's court. Then he would ask her to release him. She had\nkilled his love, and it had never been very robust; they would\nnever have achieved betrothal but for the accident to the Nawab\nBahadur's car. She belonged to the callow academic period of his\nlife which he had outgrown   Grasmere, serious talks and walks, that\nsort of thing.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIX\n\n\nThe visit of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province formed the\nnext stage in the decomposition of the Marabar. Sir Gilbert, though\nnot an enlightened man, held enlightened opinions. Exempted by a\nlong career in the Secretariate from personal contact with the\npeoples of India, he was able to speak of them urbanely, and to\ndeplore racial prejudice. He applauded the outcome of the trial,\nand congratulated Fielding on having taken \"the broad, the sensible,\nthe only possible charitable view from the first. Speaking\nconfidentially . . .\" he proceeded. Fielding deprecated confidences,\nbut Sir Gilbert insisted on imparting them; the affair had been\n\"mishandled by certain of our friends up the hill\" who did not\nrealize that \"the hands of the clock move forward, not back,\" etc.,\netc. One thing he could guarantee: the Principal would receive a\nmost cordial invitation to rejoin the club, and he begged, nay\ncommanded him, to accept. He returned to his Himalayan altitudes\nwell satisfied; the amount of money Miss Quested would have to pay,\nthe precise nature of what had happened in the caves   these were\nlocal details, and did not concern him.\n\nFielding found himself drawn more and more into Miss Quested's\naffairs. The College remained closed and he ate and slept at\nHamidullah's, so there was no reason she should not stop on if she\nwished. In her place he would have cleared out, sooner than submit\nto Ronny's half-hearted and distracted civilities, but she was\nwaiting for the hour-glass of her sojourn to run through. A house\nto live in, a garden to walk in during the brief moment of the\ncool   that was all she asked, and he was able to provide them.\nDisaster had shown her her limitations, and he realized now what\na fine loyal character she was. Her humility was touching. She\nnever repined at getting the worst of both worlds; she regarded it\nas the due punishment of her stupidity. When he hinted to her that\na personal apology to Aziz might be seemly, she said sadly: \"Of\ncourse. I ought to have thought of it myself, my instincts never\nhelp me. Why didn't I rush up to him after the trial? Yes, of\ncourse I will write him an apology, but please will you dictate\nit?\" Between them they concocted a letter, sincere, and full of\nmoving phrases, but it was not moving as a letter. \"Shall I write\nanother?\" she enquired. \"Nothing matters if I can undo the harm I\nhave caused. I can do this right, and that right; but when the two\nare put together they come wrong. That's the defect of my character.\nI have never realized it until now. I thought that if I was just\nand asked questions I would come through every difficulty.\" He\nreplied: \"Our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had\nbetter face: you have no real affection for Aziz, or Indians\ngenerally.\" She assented. \"The first time I saw you, you were\nwanting to see India, not Indians, and it occurred to me: Ah, that\nwon't take us far. Indians know whether they are liked or not   they\ncannot be fooled here. Justice never satisfies them, and that is\nwhy the British Empire rests on sand.\" Then she said: \"Do I like\nanyone, though?\" Presumably she liked Heaslop, and he changed the\nsubject, for this side of her life did not concern him.\n\nHis Indian friends were, on the other hand, a bit above themselves.\nVictory, which would have made the English sanctimonious, made them\naggressive. They wanted to develop an offensive, and tried to do\nso by discovering new grievances and wrongs, many of which had no\nexistence. They suffered from the usual disillusion that attends\nwarfare. The aims of battle and the fruits of conquest are never\nthe same; the latter have their value and only the saint rejects\nthem, but their hint of immortality vanishes as soon as they are\nheld in the hand. Although Sir Gilbert had been courteous, almost\nobsequious, the fabric he represented had in no wise bowed its\nhead. British officialism remained, as all-pervading and as\nunpleasant as the sun; and what was next to be done against it was\nnot very obvious, even to Mahmoud Ali. Loud talk and trivial\nlawlessness were attempted, and behind them continued a genuine\nbut vague desire for education. \"Mr. Fielding, we must all be\neducated promptly.\"\n\nAziz was friendly and domineering. He wanted Fielding to \"give in\nto the East,\" as he called it, and live in a condition of\naffectionate dependence upon it. \"You can trust me, Cyril.\" No\nquestion of that, and Fielding had no roots among his own people.\nYet he really couldn't become a sort of Mohammed Latif. When they\nargued about it something racial intruded   not bitterly, but\ninevitably, like the colour of their skins: coffee-colour versus\npinko-grey. And Aziz would conclude: \"Can't you see that I'm\ngrateful to you for your help and want to reward you?\" And the\nother would retort: \"If you want to reward me, let Miss Quested\noff paying.\"\n\nThe insensitiveness about Adela displeased him. It would, from\nevery point of view, be right to treat her generously, and one day\nhe had the notion of appealing to the memory of Mrs. Moore. Aziz\nhad this high and fantastic estimate of Mrs. Moore. Her death had\nbeen a real grief to his warm heart; he wept like a child and\nordered his three children to weep also. There was no doubt that\nhe respected and loved her. Fielding's first attempt was a failure.\nThe reply was: \"I see your trick. I want revenge on them. Why\nshould I be insulted and suffer and the contents of my pockets read\nand my wife's photograph taken to the police station? Also I want\nthe money   to educate my little boys, as I explained to her.\" But\nhe began to weaken, and Fielding was not ashamed to practise a\nlittle necromancy. Whenever the question of compensation came up,\nhe introduced the dead woman's name. Just as other propagandists\ninvented her a tomb, so did he raise a questionable image of her\nin the heart of Aziz, saying nothing that he believed to be untrue,\nbut producing something that was probably far from the truth. Aziz\nyielded suddenly. He felt it was Mrs. Moore's wish that he should\nspare the woman who was about to marry her son, that it was the\nonly honour he could pay her, and he renounced with a passionate\nand beautiful outburst the whole of the compensation money, claiming\nonly costs. It was fine of him, and, as he foresaw, it won him no\ncredit with the English. They still believed he was guilty, they\nbelieved it to the end of their careers, and retired Anglo-Indians\nin Tunbridge Wells or Cheltenham still murmur to each other: \"That\nMarabar case which broke down because the poor girl couldn't face\ngiving her evidence   that was another bad case.\"\n\nWhen the affair was thus officially ended, Ronny, who was about to\nbe transferred to another part of the Province, approached Fielding\nwith his usual constraint and said: \"I wish to thank you for the\nhelp you have given Miss Quested. She will not of course trespass\non your hospitality further; she has as a matter of fact decided\nto return to England. I have just arranged about her passage for\nher. I understand she would like to see you.\"\n\n\"I shall go round at once.\"\n\nOn reaching the College, he found her in some upset. He learnt that\nthe engagement had been broken by Ronny. \"Far wiser of him,\" she\nsaid pathetically. \"I ought to have spoken myself, but I drifted\non wondering what would happen. I would willingly have gone on\nspoiling his life through inertia   one has nothing to do, one\nbelongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing\nit.\" In order to reassure him, she added: \"I speak only of India.\nI am not astray in England. I fit in there   no, don't think I shall\ndo harm in England. When I am forced back there, I shall settle\ndown to some career. I have sufficient money left to start myself,\nand heaps of friends of my own type. I shall be quite all right.\"\nThen sighing: \"But oh, the trouble I've brought on everyone here. . . .\nI can never get over it. My carefulness as to whether we\nshould marry or not . . . and in the end Ronny and I part and\naren't even sorry. We ought never to have thought of marriage.\nWeren't you amazed when our engagement was originally announced?\"\n\n\"Not much. At my age one's seldom amazed,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Marriage is too absurd in any case. It begins and continues for\nsuch very slight reasons. The social business props it up on one\nside, and the theological business on the other, but neither of\nthem are marriage, are they? I've friends who can't remember why\nthey married, no more can their wives. I suspect that it mostly\nhappens haphazard, though afterwards various noble reasons are\ninvented. About marriage I am cynical.\"\n\n\"I am not. This false start has been all my own fault. I was\nbringing to Ronny nothing that ought to be brought, that was why\nhe rejected me really. I entered that cave thinking: Am I fond of\nhim? I have not yet told you that, Mr. Fielding. I didn't feel\njustified. Tenderness, respect, personal intercourse   I tried to\nmake them take the place   of      \"\n\n\"I no longer want love,\" he said, supplying the word.\n\n\"No more do I. My experiences here have cured me. But I want others\nto want it.\"\n\n\"But to go back to our first talk (for I suppose this is our last\none)   when you entered that cave, who did follow you, or did no one\nfollow you? Can you now say? I don't like it left in air.\"\n\n\"Let us call it the guide,\" she said indifferently. \"It will never\nbe known. It's as if I ran my finger along that polished wall in\nthe dark, and cannot get further. I am up against something, and\nso are you. Mrs. Moore   she did know.\"\n\n\"How could she have known what we don't?\"\n\n\"Telepathy, possibly.\"\n\nThe pert, meagre word fell to the ground. Telepathy? What an\nexplanation! Better withdraw it, and Adela did so. She was at the\nend of her spiritual tether, and so was he. Were there worlds\nbeyond which they could never touch, or did all that is possible\nenter their consciousness? They could not tell. They only realized\nthat their outlook was more or less similar, and found in this a\nsatisfaction. Perhaps life is a mystery, not a muddle; they could\nnot tell. Perhaps the hundred Indias which fuss and squabble so\ntiresomely are one, and the universe they mirror is one. They had\nnot the apparatus for judging.\n\n\"Write to me when you get to England.\"\n\n\"I shall, often. You have been excessively kind. Now that I'm\ngoing, I realize it. I wish I could do something for you in return,\nbut I see you've all you want.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied after a pause. \"I have never felt more\nhappy and secure out here. I really do get on with Indians, and\nthey do trust me. It's pleasant that I haven't had to resign my\njob. It's pleasant to be praised by an L.-G. Until the next\nearthquake I remain as I am.\"\n\n\"Of course this death has been troubling me.\"\n\n\"Aziz was so fond of her too.\"\n\n\"But it has made me remember that we must all die: all these\npersonal relations we try to live by are temporary. I used to feel\ndeath selected people, it is a notion one gets from novels, because\nsome of the characters are usually left talking at the end. Now\n   death spares no one' begins to be real.\"\n\n\"Don't let it become too real, or you'll die yourself. That is the\nobjection to meditating upon death. We are subdued to what we work\nin. I have felt the same temptation, and had to sheer off. I want\nto go on living a bit.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\nA friendliness, as of dwarfs shaking hands, was in the air. Both\nman and woman were at the height of their powers   sensible, honest,\neven subtle. They spoke the same language, and held the same\nopinions, and the variety of age and sex did not divide them. Yet\nthey were dissatisfied. When they agreed, \"I want to go on living\na bit,\" or, \"I don't believe in God,\" the words were followed by\na curious backwash as though the universe had displaced itself to\nfill up a tiny void, or as though they had seen their own gestures\nfrom an immense height   dwarfs talking, shaking hands and assuring\neach other that they stood on the same footing of insight. They\ndid not think they were wrong, because as soon as honest people\nthink they are wrong instability sets up. Not for them was an\ninfinite goal behind the stars, and they never sought it. But\nwistfulness descended on them now, as on other occasions; the\nshadow of the shadow of a dream fell over their clear-cut interests,\nand objects never seen again seemed messages from another world.\n\n\"And I do like you so very much, if I may say so,\" he affirmed.\n\n\"I'm glad, for I like you. Let's meet again.\"\n\n\"We will, in England, if I ever take home leave.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you're not likely to do that yet.\"\n\n\"Quite a chance. I have a scheme on now as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would be very nice.\"\n\nSo it petered out. Ten days later Adela went off, by the same route\nas her dead friend. The final beat up before the monsoon had come.\nThe country was stricken and blurred. Its houses, trees and fields\nwere all modelled out of the same brown paste, and the sea at\nBombay slid about like broth against the quays. Her last Indian\nadventure was with Antony, who followed her on to the boat and\ntried to blackmail her. She had been Mr. Fielding's mistress,\nAntony said. Perhaps Antony was discontented with his tip. She rang\nthe cabin bell and had him turned out, but his statement created\nrather a scandal, and people did not speak to her much during the\nfirst part of the voyage. Through the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea\nshe was left to herself, and to the dregs of Chandrapore.\n\nWith Egypt the atmosphere altered. The clean sands, heaped on each\nside of the canal, seemed to wipe off everything that was difficult\nand equivocal, and even Port Said looked pure and charming in the\nlight of a rose-grey morning. She went on shore there with an\nAmerican missionary, they walked out to the Lesseps statue, they\ndrank the tonic air of the Levant. \"To what duties, Miss Quested,\nare you returning in your own country after your taste of the\ntropics?\" the missionary asked.\n\n\"Observe, I don't say to what do you turn, but to what do you\n_re_-turn. Every life ought to contain both a turn and a _re_-turn.\nThis celebrated pioneer (he pointed to the statue) will make my\nquestion clear. He turns to the East, he _re_-turns to the West.\nYou can see it from the cute position of his hands, one of which\nholds a string of sausages.\" The missionary looked at her\nhumorously, in order to cover the emptiness of his mind. He had no\nidea what he meant by \"turn\" and \"return,\" but he often used words\nin pairs, for the sake of moral brightness. \"I see,\" she replied.\nSuddenly, in the Mediterranean clarity, she had seen. Her first\nduty on returning to England was to look up those other children\nof Mrs. Moore's, Ralph and Stella, then she would turn to her\nprofession. Mrs. Moore had tended to keep the products of her two\nmarriages apart, and Adela had not come across the younger branch\nso far.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXX\n\n\nAnother local consequence of the trial was a Hindu-Moslem entente.\nLoud protestations of amity were exchanged by prominent citizens,\nand there went with them a genuine desire for a good understanding.\nAziz, when he was at the hospital one day, received a visit from\nrather a sympathetic figure: Mr. Das. The magistrate sought two\nfavours from him: a remedy for shingles and a poem for his\nbrother-in-law's new monthly magazine. He accorded both.\n\n\"My dear Das, why, when you tried to send me to prison, should I\ntry to send Mr. Bhattacharya a poem? Eh? That is naturally entirely\na joke. I will write him the best I can, but I thought your magazine\nwas for Hindus.\"\n\n\"It is not for Hindus, but Indians generally,\" he said timidly.\n\n\"There is no such person in existence as the general Indian.\"\n\n\"There was not, but there may be when you have written a poem. You\nare our hero; the whole city is behind you, irrespective of creed.\"\n\n\"I know, but will it last?\"\n\n\"I fear not,\" said Das, who had much mental clearness. \"And for\nthat reason, if I may say so, do not introduce too many Persian\nexpressions into the poem, and not too much about the bulbul.\"\n\n\"Half a sec,\" said Aziz, biting his pencil. He was writing out a\nprescription. \"Here you are. . . . Is not this better than a poem?\"\n\n\"Happy the man who can compose both.\"\n\n\"You are full of compliments to-day.\"\n\n\"I know you bear me a grudge for trying that case,\" said the other,\nstretching out his hand impulsively. \"You are so kind and friendly,\nbut always I detect irony beneath your manner.\"\n\n\"No, no, what nonsense!\" protested Aziz. They shook hands, in a\nhalf-embrace that typified the entente. Between people of distant\nclimes there is always the possibility of romance, but the various\nbranches of Indians know too much about each other to surmount the\nunknowable easily. The approach is prosaic. \"Excellent,\" said Aziz,\npatting a stout shoulder and thinking, \"I wish they did not remind\nme of cow-dung\"; Das thought, \"Some Moslems are very violent.\" They\nsmiled wistfully, each spying the thought in the other's heart,\nand Das, the more articulate, said: \"Excuse my mistakes, realize\nmy limitations. Life is not easy as we know it on the earth.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, about this poem   how did you hear I sometimes scribbled?\"\nhe asked, much pleased, and a good deal moved   for literature had\nalways been a solace to him, something that the ugliness of facts\ncould not spoil.\n\n\"Professor Godbole often mentioned it, before his departure for\nMau.\"\n\n\"How did he hear?\"\n\n\"He too was a poet; do you not divine each other?\"\n\nFlattered by the invitation, he got to work that evening. The feel\nof the pen between his fingers generated bulbuls at once. His poem\nwas again about the decay of Islam and the brevity of love; as sad\nand sweet as he could contrive, but not nourished by personal\nexperience, and of no interest to these excellent Hindus. Feeling\ndissatisfied, he rushed to the other extreme, and wrote a satire,\nwhich was too libellous to print. He could only express pathos or\nvenom, though most of his life had no concern with either. He loved\npoetry   science was merely an acquisition, which he laid aside when\nunobserved like his European dress   and this evening he longed to\ncompose a new song which should be acclaimed by multitudes and even\nsung in the fields. In what language shall it be written? And what\nshall it announce? He vowed to see more of Indians who were not\nMohammedans, and never to look backward. It is the only healthy\ncourse. Of what help, in this latitude and hour, are the glories\nof Cordova and Samarcand? They have gone, and while we lament them\nthe English occupy Delhi and exclude us from East Africa. Islam\nitself, though true, throws cross-lights over the path to freedom.\nThe song of the future must transcend creed.\n\nThe poem for Mr. Bhattacharya never got written, but it had an\neffect. It led him towards the vague and bulky figure of a\nmother-land. He was without natural affection for the land of his\nbirth, but the Marabar Hills drove him to it. Half closing his\neyes, he attempted to love India. She must imitate Japan. Not until\nshe is a nation will her sons be treated with respect. He grew\nharder and less approachable. The English, whom he had laughed at\nor ignored, persecuted him everywhere; they had even thrown nets\nover his dreams. \"My great mistake has been taking our rulers as\na joke,\" he said to Hamidullah next day; who replied with a sigh:\n\"It is far the wisest way to take them, but not possible in the\nlong run. Sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs, and\nreveals their secret thoughts about our character. If God himself\ndescended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent,\nthey would disbelieve him. Now you see why Mahmoud Ali and self\nwaste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like\nRam Chand.\"\n\n\"I cannot endure committees. I shall go right away.\"\n\n\"Where to? Turtons and Burtons, all are the same.\"\n\n\"But not in an Indian state.\"\n\n\"I believe the Politicals are obliged to have better manners. It\namounts to no more.\"\n\n\"I do want to get away from British India, even to a poor job. I\nthink I could write poetry there. I wish I had lived in Babur's\ntime and fought and written for him. Gone, gone, and not even any\nuse to say    Gone, gone,' for it weakens us while we say it. We need\na king, Hamidullah; it would make our lives easier. As it is, we\nmust try to appreciate these quaint Hindus. My notion now is to\ntry for some post as doctor in one of their states.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is going much too far.\"\n\n\"It is not going as far as Mr. Ram Chand.\"\n\n\"But the money, the money   they will never pay an adequate salary,\nthose savage Rajahs.\"\n\n\"I shall never be rich anywhere, it is outside my character.\"\n\n\"If you had been sensible and made Miss Quested pay      \"\n\n\"I chose not to. Discussion of the past is useless,\" he said, with\nsudden sharpness of tone. \"I have allowed her to keep her fortune\nand buy herself a husband in England, for which it will be very\nnecessary. Don't mention the matter again.\"\n\n\"Very well, but your life must continue a poor man's; no holidays\nin Kashmir for you yet, you must stick to your profession and rise\nto a highly paid post, not retire to a jungle-state and write\npoems. Educate your children, read the latest scientific periodicals,\ncompel European doctors to respect you. Accept the consequences of\nyour own actions like a man.\"\n\nAziz winked at him slowly and said: \"We are not in the law courts.\nThere are many ways of being a man; mine is to express what is\ndeepest in my heart.\"\n\n\"To such a remark there is certainly no reply,\" said Hamidullah,\nmoved. Recovering himself and smiling, he said: \"Have you heard\nthis naughty rumour that Mohammed Latif has got hold of?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"When Miss Quested stopped in the College, Fielding used to visit\nher . . . rather too late in the evening, the servants say.\"\n\n\"A pleasant change for her if he did,\" said Aziz, making a curious\nface.\n\n\"But you understand my meaning?\"\n\nThe young man winked again and said: \"Just! Still, your meaning\ndoesn't help me out of my difficulties. I am determined to leave\nChandrapore. The problem is, for where? I am determined to write\npoetry. The problem is, about what? You give me no assistance.\"\nThen, surprising both Hamidullah and himself, he had an explosion\nof nerves. \"But who does give me assistance? No one is my friend.\nAll are traitors, even my own children. I have had enough of\nfriends.\"\n\n\"I was going to suggest we go behind the purdah, but your three\ntreacherous children are there, so you will not want to.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, it is ever since I was in prison my temper is strange;\ntake me, forgive me.\"\n\n\"Nureddin's mother is visiting my wife now. That is all right, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"They come before me separately, but not so far together. You had\nbetter prepare them for the united shock of my face.\"\n\n\"No, let us surprise them without warning, far too much nonsense\nstill goes on among our ladies. They pretended at the time of your\ntrial they would give up purdah; indeed, those of them who can\nwrite composed a document to that effect, and now it ends in\nhumbug. You know how deeply they all respect Fielding, but not one\nof them has seen him. My wife says she will, but always when he\ncalls there is some excuse   she is not feeling well, she is ashamed\nof the room, she has no nice sweets to offer him, only Elephants'\nEars, and if I say Elephants' Ears are Mr. Fielding's favourite\nsweet, she replies that he will know how badly hers are made, so\nshe cannot see him on their account. For fifteen years, my dear\nboy, have I argued with my begum, for fifteen years, and never\ngained a point, yet the missionaries inform us our women are\ndown-trodden. If you want a subject for a poem, take this: The\nIndian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXXI\n\n\nAziz had no sense of evidence. The sequence of his emotions decided\nhis beliefs, and led to the tragic coolness between himself and\nhis English friend. They had conquered but were not to be crowned.\nFielding was away at a conference, and after the rumour about Miss\nQuested had been with him undisturbed for a few days, he assumed\nit was true. He had no objection on moral grounds to his friends\namusing themselves, and Cyril, being middle-aged, could no longer\nexpect the pick of the female market, and must take his amusement\nwhere he could find it. But he resented him making up to this\nparticular woman, whom he still regarded as his enemy; also, why\nhad he not been told? What is friendship without confidences? He\nhimself had told things sometimes regarded as shocking, and the\nEnglishman had listened, tolerant, but surrendering nothing in\nreturn.\n\nHe met Fielding at the railway station on his return, agreed to\ndine with him, and then started taxing him by the oblique method,\noutwardly merry. An avowed European scandal there was   Mr. McBryde\nand Miss Derek. Miss Derek's faithful attachment to Chandrapore\nwas now explained: Mr. McBryde had been caught in her room, and\nhis wife was divorcing him. \"That pure-minded fellow. However, he\nwill blame the Indian climate. Everything is our fault really. Now,\nhave I not discovered an important piece of news for you, Cyril?\"\n\n\"Not very,\" said Fielding, who took little interest in distant\nsins. \"Listen to mine.\" Aziz' face lit up. \"At the conference, it\nwas settled. . . .\"\n\n\"This evening will do for schoolmastery. I should go straight to\nthe Minto now, the cholera looks bad. We begin to have local cases\nas well as imported. In fact, the whole of life is somewhat sad.\nThe new Civil Surgeon is the same as the last, but does not yet\ndare to be. That is all any administrative change amounts to. All\nmy suffering has won nothing for us. But look here, Cyril, while\nI remember it. There's gossip about you as well as McBryde. They\nsay that you and Miss Quested became also rather too intimate\nfriends. To speak perfectly frankly, they say you and she have been\nguilty of impropriety.\"\n\n\"They would say that.\"\n\n\"It's all over the town, and may injure your reputation. You know,\neveryone is by no means your supporter. I have tried all I could\nto silence such a story.\"\n\n\"Don't bother. Miss Quested has cleared out at last.\"\n\n\"It is those who stop in the country, not those who leave it, whom\nsuch a story injures. Imagine my dismay and anxiety. I could\nscarcely get a wink of sleep. First my name was coupled with her\nand now it is yours.\"\n\n\"Don't use such exaggerated phrases.\"\n\n\"As what?\"\n\n\"As dismay and anxiety.\"\n\n\"Have I not lived all my life in India? Do I not know what produces\na bad impression here?\" His voice shot up rather crossly.\n\n\"Yes, but the scale, the scale. You always get the scale wrong, my\ndear fellow. A pity there is this rumour, but such a very small\npity   so small that we may as well talk of something else.\"\n\n\"You mind for Miss Quested's sake, though. I can see from your\nface.\"\n\n\"As far as I do mind. I travel light.\"\n\n\"Cyril, that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin.\nIt is raising up enemies against you on all sides, and makes me\nfeel excessively uneasy.\"\n\n\"What enemies?\"\n\nSince Aziz had only himself in mind, he could not reply. Feeling\na fool, he became angrier. \"I have given you list after list of\nthe people who cannot be trusted in this city. In your position I\nshould have the sense to know I was surrounded by enemies. You\nobserve I speak in a low voice. It is because I see your sais is\nnew. How do I know he isn't a spy?\" He lowered his voice: \"Every\nthird servant is a spy.\"\n\n\"Now, what is the matter?\" he asked, smiling.\n\n\"Do you contradict my last remark?\"\n\n\"It simply doesn't affect me. Spies are as thick as mosquitoes,\nbut it's years before I shall meet the one that kills me. You've\nsomething else in your mind.\"\n\n\"I've not; don't be ridiculous.\"\n\n\"You have. You're cross with me about something or other.\"\n\nAny direct attack threw him out of action. Presently he said: \"So\nyou and Madamsell Adela used to amuse one another in the evening,\nnaughty boy.\"\n\nThose drab and high-minded talks had scarcely made for dalliance.\nFielding was so startled at the story being taken seriously, and\nso disliked being called a naughty boy, that he lost his head and\ncried: \"You little rotter! Well, I'm damned. Amusement indeed. Is\nit likely at such a time?\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure. The licentious Oriental\nimagination was at work,\" he replied, speaking gaily, but cut to\nthe heart; for hours after his mistake he bled inwardly.\n\n\"You see, Aziz, the circumstances . . . also the girl was still\nengaged to Heaslop, also I never felt . . .\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but you didn't contradict what I said, so I thought it\nwas true. Oh dear, East and West. Most misleading. Will you please\nput your little rotter down at his hospital?\"\n\n\"You're not offended?\"\n\n\"Most certainly I am not.\"\n\n\"If you are, this must be cleared up later on.\"\n\n\"It has been,\" he answered, dignified. \"I believe absolutely what\nyou say, and of that there need be no further question.\"\n\n\"But the way I said it must be cleared up. I was unintentionally\nrude. Unreserved regrets.\"\n\n\"The fault is entirely mine.\"\n\nTangles like this still interrupted their intercourse. A pause in\nthe wrong place, an intonation misunderstood, and a whole\nconversation went awry. Fielding had been startled, not shocked,\nbut how convey the difference? There is always trouble when two\npeople do not think of sex at the same moment, always mutual\nresentment and surprise, even when the two people are of the same\nrace. He began to recapitulate his feelings about Miss Quested.\nAziz cut him short with: \"But I believe you, I believe. Mohammed\nLatif shall be severely punished for inventing this.\"\n\n\"Oh, leave it alone, like all gossip   it's merely one of those\nhalf-alive things that try to crowd out real life. Take no notice,\nit'll vanish, like poor old Mrs. Moore's tombs.\"\n\n\"Mohammed Latif has taken to intriguing. We are already much\ndispleased with him. Will it satisfy you if we send him back to\nhis family without a present?\"\n\n\"We'll discuss M.L. at dinner.\"\n\nHis eyes went clotted and hard. \"Dinner. This is most unlucky       I\nforgot. I have promised to dine with Das.\"\n\n\"Bring Das to me.\"\n\n\"He will have invited other friends.\"\n\n\"You are coming to dinner with me as arranged,\" said Fielding,\nlooking away. \"I don't stand this. You are coming to dinner with\nme. You come.\"\n\nThey had reached the hospital now. Fielding continued round the\nMaidan alone. He was annoyed with himself, but counted on dinner\nto pull things straight. At the post office he saw the Collector.\nTheir vehicles were parked side by side while their servants\ncompeted in the interior of the building. \"Good morning; so you\nare back,\" said Turton icily. \"I should be glad if you will put in\nyour appearance at the club this evening.\"\n\n\"I have accepted re-election, sir. Do you regard it as necessary\nI should come? I should be glad to be excused; indeed, I have a\ndinner engagement this evening.\"\n\n\"It is not a question of your feelings, but of the wish of the\nLieutenant-Governor. Perhaps you will ask me whether I speak\nofficially. I do. I shall expect you this evening at six. We shall\nnot interfere with your subsequent plans.\"\n\nHe attended the grim little function in due course. The skeletons\nof hospitality rattled   \"Have a peg, have a drink.\" He talked for\nfive minutes to Mrs. Blakiston, who was the only surviving female.\nHe talked to McBryde, who was defiant about his divorce, conscious\nthat he had sinned as a sahib. He talked to Major Roberts, the new\nCivil Surgeon; and to young Milner, the new City Magistrate; but\nthe more the club changed, the more it promised to be the same\nthing. \"It is no good,\" he thought, as he returned past the mosque,\n\"we all build upon sand; and the more modern the country gets, the\nworse'll be the crash. In the old eighteenth century, when cruelty\nand injustice raged, an invisible power repaired their ravages.\nEverything echoes now; there's no stopping the echo. The original\nsound may be harmless, but the echo is always evil.\" This reflection\nabout an echo lay at the verge of Fielding's mind. He could never\ndevelop it. It belonged to the universe that he had missed or\nrejected. And the mosque missed it too. Like himself, those shallow\narcades provided but a limited asylum. \"There is no God but God\"\ndoesn't carry us far through the complexities of matter and spirit;\nit is only a game with words, really, a religious pun, not a\nreligious truth.\n\nHe found Aziz overtired and dispirited, and he determined not to\nallude to their misunderstanding until the end of the evening; it\nwould be more acceptable then. He made a clean breast about the\nclub   said he had only gone under compulsion, and should never\nattend again unless the order was renewed. \"In other words, probably\nnever; for I am going quite soon to England.\"\n\n\"I thought you might end in England,\" he said very quietly, then\nchanged the conversation. Rather awkwardly they ate their dinner,\nthen went out to sit in the Mogul garden-house.\n\n\"I am only going for a little time. On official business. My\nservice is anxious to get me away from Chandrapore for a bit. It\nis obliged to value me highly, but does not care for me. The\nsituation is somewhat humorous.\"\n\n\"What is the nature of the business? Will it leave you much spare\ntime?\"\n\n\"Enough to see my friends.\"\n\n\"I expected you to make such a reply. You are a faithful friend.\nShall we now talk about something else?\"\n\n\"Willingly. What subject?\"\n\n\"Poetry,\" he said, with tears in his eyes. \"Let us discuss why\npoetry has lost the power of making men brave. My mother's father\nwas also a poet, and fought against you in the Mutiny. I might\nequal him if there was another mutiny. As it is, I am a doctor,\nwho has won a case and has three children to support, and whose\nchief subject of conversation is official plans.\"\n\n\"Let us talk about poetry.\" He turned his mind to the innocuous\nsubject. \"You people are sadly circumstanced. Whatever are you to\nwrite about? You cannot say,    The rose is faded,' for evermore. We\nknow it's faded. Yet you can't have patriotic poetry of the    India,\nmy India' type, when it's nobody's India.\"\n\n\"I like this conversation. It may lead to something interesting.\"\n\n\"You are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life. When\nI knew you first, you used it as an incantation.\"\n\n\"I was a child when you knew me first. Everyone was my friend then.\nThe Friend: a Persian expression for God. But I do not want to be\na religious poet either.\"\n\n\"I hoped you would be.\"\n\n\"Why, when you yourself are an atheist?\"\n\n\"There is something in religion that may not be true, but has not\nyet been sung.\"\n\n\"Explain in detail.\"\n\n\"Something that the Hindus have perhaps found.\"\n\n\"Let them sing it.\"\n\n\"Hindus are unable to sing.\"\n\n\"Cyril, you sometimes make a sensible remark. That will do for\npoetry for the present. Let us now return to your English visit.\"\n\n\"We haven't discussed poetry for two seconds,\" said the other,\nsmiling.\n\nBut Aziz was addicted to cameos. He held the tiny conversation in\nhis hand, and felt it epitomized his problem. For an instant he\nrecalled his wife, and, as happens when a memory is intense, the\npast became the future, and he saw her with him in a quiet Hindu\njungle native state, far away from foreigners. He said: \"I suppose\nyou will visit Miss Quested.\"\n\n\"If I have time. It will be strange seeing her in Hampstead.\"\n\n\"What is Hampstead?\"\n\n\"An artistic and thoughtful little suburb of London      \"\n\n\"And there she lives in comfort: you will enjoy seeing her. . . .\nDear me, I've got a headache this evening. Perhaps I am going to\nhave cholera. With your permission, I'll leave early.\"\n\n\"When would you like the carriage?\"\n\n\"Don't trouble   I'll bike.\"\n\n\"But you haven't got your bicycle. My carriage fetched you   let it\ntake you away.\"\n\n\"Sound reasoning,\" he said, trying to be gay. \"I have not got my\nbicycle. But I am seen too often in your carriage. I am thought to\ntake advantage of your generosity by Mr. Ram Chand.\" He was out of\nsorts and uneasy. The conversation jumped from topic to topic in\na broken-backed fashion. They were affectionate and intimate, but\nnothing clicked tight.\n\n\"Aziz, you have forgiven me the stupid remark I made this morning?\"\n\n\"When you called me a little rotter?\"\n\n\"Yes, to my eternal confusion. You know how fond I am of you.\"\n\n\"That is nothing, of course, we all of us make mistakes. In a\nfriendship such as ours a few slips are of no consequence.\"\n\nBut as he drove off, something depressed him   a dull pain of body\nor mind, waiting to rise to the surface. When he reached the\nbungalow he wanted to return and say something very affectionate;\ninstead, he gave the sais a heavy tip, and sat down gloomily on\nthe bed, and Hassan massaged him incompetently. The eye-flies had\ncolonized the top of an almeira; the red stains on the durry were\nthicker, for Mohammed Latif had slept here during his imprisonment\nand spat a good deal; the table drawer was scarred where the police\nhad forced it open; everything in Chandrapore was used up, including\nthe air. The trouble rose to the surface now: he was suspicious;\nhe suspected his friend of intending to marry Miss Quested for the\nsake of her money, and of going to England for that purpose.\n\n\"Huzoor?\"   for he had muttered.\n\n\"Look at those flies on the ceiling. Why have you not drowned\nthem?\"\n\n\"Huzoor, they return.\"\n\n\"Like all evil things.\"\n\nTo divert the conversation, Hassan related how the kitchen-boy had\nkilled a snake, good, but killed it by cutting it in two, bad,\nbecause it becomes two snakes.\n\n\"When he breaks a plate, does it become two plates?\"\n\n\"Glasses and a new teapot will similarly be required, also for\nmyself a coat.\"\n\nAziz sighed. Each for himself. One man needs a coat, another a rich\nwife; each approaches his goal by a clever detour. Fielding had\nsaved the girl a fine of twenty thousand rupees, and now followed\nher to England. If he desired to marry her, all was explained; she\nwould bring him a larger dowry. Aziz did not believe his own\nsuspicions   better if he had, for then he would have denounced and\ncleared the situation up. Suspicion and belief could in his mind\nexist side by side. They sprang from different sources, and need\nnever intermingle. Suspicion in the Oriental is a sort of malignant\ntumour, a mental malady, that makes him self-conscious and\nunfriendly suddenly; he trusts and mistrusts at the same time in\na way the Westerner cannot comprehend. It is his demon, as the\nWesterner's is hypocrisy. Aziz was seized by it, and his fancy\nbuilt a satanic castle, of which the foundation had been laid when\nhe talked at Dilkusha under the stars. The girl had surely been\nCyril's mistress when she stopped in the College   Mohammed Latif\nwas right. But was that all? Perhaps it was Cyril who followed her\ninto the cave. . . . No; impossible. Cyril hadn't been on the Kawa\nDol at all. Impossible. Ridiculous. Yet the fancy left him trembling\nwith misery. Such treachery   if true   would have been the worst in\nIndian history; nothing so vile, not even the murder of Afzul Khan\nby Sivaji. He was shaken, as though by a truth, and told Hassan to\nleave him.\n\nNext day he decided to take his children back to Mussoorie. They\nhad come down for the trial, that he might bid them farewell, and\nhad stayed on at Hamidullah's for the rejoicings. Major Roberts\nwould give him leave, and during his absence Fielding would go off\nto England. The idea suited both his beliefs and his suspicions.\nEvents would prove which was right, and preserve, in either case,\nhis dignity.\n\nFielding was conscious of something hostile, and because he was\nreally fond of Aziz his optimism failed him. Travelling light is\nless easy as soon as affection is involved. Unable to jog forward\nin the serene hope that all would come right, he wrote an elaborate\nletter in the rather modern style: \"It is on my mind that you think\nme a prude about women. I had rather you thought anything else of\nme. If I live impeccably now, it is only because I am well on the\nforties   a period of revision. In the eighties I shall revise again.\nAnd before the nineties come   I shall be revised! But, alive or\ndead, I am absolutely devoid of morals. Do kindly grasp this about\nme.\" Aziz did not care for the letter at all. It hurt his delicacy.\nHe liked confidences, however gross, but generalizations and\ncomparisons always repelled him. Life is not a scientific manual.\nHe replied coldly, regretting his inability to return from Mussoorie\nbefore his friend sailed: \"But I must take my poor little holiday\nwhile I can. All must be economy henceforward, all hopes of Kashmir\nhave vanished for ever and ever. When you return I shall be slaving\nfar away in some new post.\"\n\nAnd Fielding went, and in the last gutterings of Chandrapore   heaven\nand earth both looking like toffee   the Indian's bad fancies were\nconfirmed. His friends encouraged them, for though they had liked\nthe Principal, they felt uneasy at his getting to know so much\nabout their private affairs. Mahmoud Ali soon declared that\ntreachery was afoot. Hamidullah murmured, \"Certainly of late he no\nlonger addressed us with his former frankness,\" and warned Aziz\n\"not to expect too much   he and she are, after all, both members of\nanother race.\" \"Where are my twenty thousand rupees?\" he thought.\nHe was absolutely indifferent to money   not merely generous with\nit, but promptly paying his debts when he could remember to do\nso   yet these rupees haunted his mind, because he had been tricked\nabout them, and allowed them to escape overseas, like so much of\nthe wealth of India. Cyril would marry Miss Quested   he grew certain\nof it, all the unexplained residue of the Marabar contributing. It\nwas the natural conclusion of the horrible senseless picnic, and\nbefore long he persuaded himself that the wedding had actually\ntaken place.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

At the end was the small but famous\nshrine of the dynastic cult, and the God to be born was largely a\nsilver image the size of a teaspoon. Hindus sat on either side of\nthe carpet where they could find room, or overflowed into the\nadjoining corridors and the courtyard   Hindus, Hindus only,\nmild-featured men, mostly villagers, for whom anything outside\ntheir villages passed in a dream. They were the toiling ryot, whom\nsome call the real India. Mixed with them sat a few tradesmen out\nof the little town, officials, courtiers, scions of the ruling\nhouse. Schoolboys kept inefficient order. The assembly was in a\ntender, happy state unknown to an English crowd, it seethed like\na beneficent potion. When the villagers broke cordon for a glimpse\nof the silver image, a most beautiful and radiant expression came\ninto their faces, a beauty in which there was nothing personal,\nfor it caused them all to resemble one another during the moment\nof its indwelling, and only when it was withdrawn did they revert\nto individual clods. And so with the music. Music there was, but\nfrom so many sources that the sum-total was untrammelled. The\nbraying banging crooning melted into a single mass which trailed\nround the palace before joining the thunder. Rain fell at intervals\nthroughout the night.\n\nIt was the turn of Professor Godbole's choir. As Minister of\nEducation, he gained this special honour. When the previous group\nof singers dispersed into the crowd, he pressed forward from the\nback, already in full voice, that the chain of sacred sounds might\nbe uninterrupted. He was barefoot and in white, he wore a pale blue\nturban; his gold pince-nez had caught in a jasmine garland, and\nlay sideways down his nose. He and the six colleagues who supported\nhim clashed their cymbals, hit small drums, droned upon a portable\nharmonium, and sang:\n\n   \"Tukaram, Tukaram,\n    Thou art my father and mother and everybody.\n    Tukaram, Tukaram,\n    Thou art my father and mother and everybody.\n    Tukaram, Tukaram. . . .\"\n\nThey sang not even to the God who confronted them, but to a saint;\nthey did not one thing which the non-Hindu would feel dramatically\ncorrect; this approaching triumph of India was a muddle (as we call\nit), a frustration of reason and form. Where was the God Himself,\nin whose honour the congregation had gathered? Indistinguishable\nin the jumble of His own altar, huddled out of sight amid images\nof inferior descent, smothered under rose-leaves, overhung by\noleographs, outblazed by golden tablets representing the Rajah's\nancestors, and entirely obscured, when the wind blew, by the\ntattered foliage of a banana. Hundreds of electric lights had been\nlit in His honour (worked by an engine whose thumps destroyed the\nrhythm of the hymn). Yet His face could not be seen. Hundreds of\nHis silver dishes were piled around Him with the minimum of effect.\nThe inscriptions which the poets of the State had composed were\nhung where they could not be read, or had twitched their drawing-pins\nout of the stucco, and one of them (composed in English to indicate\nHis universality) consisted, by an unfortunate slip of the\ndraughtsman, of the words, \"God si Love.\"\n\nGod si Love. Is this the first message of India?\n\n  \"Tukaram, Tukaram . . .,\"\n\ncontinued the choir, reinforced by a squabble behind the purdah\ncurtain, where two mothers tried to push their children at the same\nmoment to the front. A little girl's leg shot out like an eel. In\nthe courtyard, drenched by the rain, the small Europeanized band\nstumbled off into a waltz. \"Nights of Gladness\" they were playing.\nThe singers were not perturbed by this rival, they lived beyond\ncompetition. It was long before the tiny fragment of Professor\nGodbole that attended to outside things decided that his pince-nez\nwas in trouble, and that until it was adjusted he could not choose\na new hymn. He laid down one cymbal, with the other he clashed the\nair, with his free hand he fumbled at the flowers round his neck.\nA colleague assisted him. Singing into one another's grey\nmoustaches, they disentangled the chain from the tinsel into which\nit had sunk. Godbole consulted the music-book, said a word to the\ndrummer, who broke rhythm, made a thick little blur of sound, and\nproduced a new rhythm. This was more exciting, the inner images it\nevoked more definite, and the singers' expressions became fatuous\nand languid. They loved all men, the whole universe, and scraps of\ntheir past, tiny splinters of detail, emerged for a moment to melt\ninto the universal warmth. Thus Godbole, though she was not\nimportant to him, remembered an old woman he had met in Chandrapore\ndays. Chance brought her into his mind while it was in this heated\nstate, he did not select her, she happened to occur among the\nthrong of soliciting images, a tiny splinter, and he impelled her\nby his spiritual force to that place where completeness can be\nfound. Completeness, not reconstruction. His senses grew thinner,\nhe remembered a wasp seen he forgot where, perhaps on a stone. He\nloved the wasp equally, he impelled it likewise, he was imitating\nGod. And the stone where the wasp clung   could he . . . no, he could\nnot, he had been wrong to attempt the stone, logic and conscious\neffort had seduced, he came back to the strip of red carpet and\ndiscovered that he was dancing upon it. Up and down, a third of\nthe way to the altar and back again, clashing his cymbals, his\nlittle legs twinkling, his companions dancing with him and each\nother. Noise, noise, the Europeanized band louder, incense on the\naltar, sweat, the blaze of lights, wind in the bananas, noise,\nthunder, eleven-fifty by his wrist-watch, seen as he threw up his\nhands and detached the tiny reverberation that was his soul. Louder\nshouts in the crowd. He danced on. The boys and men who were\nsquatting in the aisles were lifted forcibly and dropped without\nchanging their shapes into the laps of their neighbours. Down the\npath thus cleared advanced a litter. It was the aged ruler of the\nstate, brought against the advice of his physicians to witness the\nBirth ceremony.\n\nNo one greeted the Rajah, nor did he wish it; this was no moment\nfor human glory. Nor could the litter be set down, lest it defiled\nthe temple by becoming a throne. He was lifted out of it while its\nfeet remained in air, and deposited on the carpet close to the\naltar, his immense beard was straightened, his legs tucked under\nhim, a paper containing red powder was placed in his hand. There\nhe sat, leaning against a pillar, exhausted with illness, his eyes\nmagnified by many unshed tears.\n\nHe had not to wait long. In a land where all else was unpunctual,\nthe hour of the Birth was chronometrically observed. Three minutes\nbefore it was due, a Brahman brought forth a model of the village\nof Gokul (the Bethlehem in that nebulous story) and placed it in\nfront of the altar. The model was on a wooden tray about a yard\nsquare; it was of clay, and was gaily blue and white with streamers\nand paint. Here, upon a chair too small for him and with a head\ntoo large, sat King Kansa, who is Herod, directing the murder of\nsome Innocents, and in a corner, similarly proportioned, stood the\nfather and mother of the Lord, warned to depart in a dream. The\nmodel was not holy, but more than a decoration, for it diverted\nmen from the actual image of the God, and increased their sacred\nbewilderment. Some of the villagers thought the Birth had occurred,\nsaying with truth that the Lord must have been born, or they could\nnot see Him. But the clock struck midnight, and simultaneously the\nrending note of the conch broke forth, followed by the trumpeting\nof elephants; all who had packets of powder threw them at the\naltar, and in the rosy dust and incense, and clanging and shouts,\nInfinite Love took upon itself the form of Shri Krishna, and saved\nthe world. All sorrow was annihilated, not only for Indians, but\nfor foreigners, birds, caves, railways, and the stars; all became\njoy, all laughter; there had never been disease nor doubt,\nmisunderstanding, cruelty, fear. Some jumped in the air, others\nflung themselves prone and embraced the bare feet of the universal\nlover; the women behind the purdah slapped and shrieked; the little\ngirl slipped out and danced by herself, her black pigtails flying.\nNot an orgy of the body; the tradition of that shrine forbade it.\nBut the human spirit had tried by a desperate contortion to ravish\nthe unknown, flinging down science and history in the struggle,\nyes, beauty herself. Did it succeed? Books written afterwards say\n\"Yes.\" But how, if there is such an event, can it be remembered\nafterwards? How can it be expressed in anything but itself? Not\nonly from the unbeliever are mysteries hid, but the adept himself\ncannot retain them. He may think, if he chooses, that he has been\nwith God, but as soon as he thinks it, it becomes history, and\nfalls under the rules of time.\n\nA cobra of papier-m  ch   now appeared on the carpet, also a wooden\ncradle swinging from a frame. Professor Godbole approached the\nlatter with a red silk napkin in his arms. The napkin was God, not\nthat it was, and the image remained in the blur of the altar. It\nwas just a napkin, folded into a shape which indicated a baby's.\nThe Professor dandled it and gave it to the Rajah, who, making a\ngreat effort, said, \"I name this child Shri Krishna,\" and tumbled\nit into the cradle. Tears poured from his eyes, because he had seen\nthe Lord's salvation. He was too weak to exhibit the silk baby to\nhis people, his privilege in former years. His attendants lifted\nhim up, a new path was cleared through the crowd, and he was\ncarried away to a less sacred part of the palace. There, in a room\naccessible to Western science by an outer staircase, his physician,\nDr. Aziz, awaited him. His Hindu physician, who had accompanied\nhim to the shrine, briefly reported his symptoms. As the ecstasy\nreceded, the invalid grew fretful. The bumping of the steam engine\nthat worked the dynamo disturbed him, and he asked for what reason\nit had been introduced into his home. They replied that they would\nenquire, and administered a sedative.\n\nDown in the sacred corridors, joy had seethed to jollity. It was\ntheir duty to play various games to amuse the newly born God, and\nto simulate his sports with the wanton dairymaids of Brindaban.\nButter played a prominent part in these. When the cradle had been\nremoved, the principal nobles of the state gathered together for\nan innocent frolic. They removed their turbans, and one put a lump\nof butter on his forehead, and waited for it to slide down his nose\ninto his mouth. Before it could arrive, another stole up behind\nhim, snatched the melting morsel, and swallowed it himself. All\nlaughed exultantly at discovering that the divine sense of humour\ncoincided with their own. \"God si love!\" There is fun in heaven.\nGod can play practical jokes upon Himself, draw chairs away from\nbeneath His own posteriors, set His own turbans on fire, and steal\nHis own petticoats when He bathes. By sacrificing good taste, this\nworship achieved what Christianity has shirked: the inclusion of\nmerriment. All spirit as well as all matter must participate in\nsalvation, and if practical jokes are banned, the circle is\nincomplete. Having swallowed the butter, they played another game\nwhich chanced to be graceful: the fondling of Shri Krishna under\nthe similitude of a child. A pretty red and gold ball is thrown,\nand he who catches it chooses a child from the crowd, raises it in\nhis arms, and carries it round to be caressed. All stroke the\ndarling creature for the Creator's sake, and murmur happy words.\nThe child is restored to his parents, the ball thrown on, and\nanother child becomes for a moment the World's Desire. And the Lord\nbounds hither and thither through the aisles, chance, and the sport\nof chance, irradiating little mortals with His immortality. . . .\nWhen they had played this long enough   and being exempt from boredom,\nthey played it again and again, they played it again and again   they\ntook many sticks and hit them together, whack smack, as though they\nfought the Pandava wars, and threshed and churned with them, and\nlater on they hung from the roof of the temple, in a net, a great\nblack earthenware jar, which was painted here and there with red,\nand wreathed with dried figs. Now came a rousing sport. Springing\nup, they struck at the jar with their sticks. It cracked, broke,\nand a mass of greasy rice and milk poured on to their faces. They\nate and smeared one another's mouths, and dived between each\nother's legs for what had been pashed upon the carpet. This way\nand that spread the divine mess, until the line of schoolboys, who\nhad somewhat fended off the crowd, broke for their share. The\ncorridors, the courtyard, were filled with benign confusion. Also\nthe flies awoke and claimed their share of God's bounty. There was\nno quarrelling, owing to the nature of the gift, for blessed is\nthe man who confers it on another, he imitates God. And those\n\"imitations,\" those \"substitutions,\" continued to flicker through\nthe assembly for many hours, awaking in each man, according to his\ncapacity, an emotion that he would not have had otherwise. No\ndefinite image survived; at the Birth it was questionable whether\na silver doll or a mud village, or a silk napkin, or an intangible\nspirit, or a pious resolution, had been born. Perhaps all these\nthings! Perhaps none! Perhaps all birth is an allegory! Still, it\nwas the main event of the religious year. It caused strange\nthoughts. Covered with grease and dust, Professor Godbole had once\nmore developed the life of his spirit. He had, with increasing\nvividness, again seen Mrs. Moore, and round her faintly clinging\nforms of trouble. He was a Brahman, she Christian, but it made no\ndifference, it made no difference whether she was a trick of his\nmemory or a telepathic appeal. It was his duty, as it was his\ndesire, to place himself in the position of the God and to love\nher, and to place himself in her position and to say to the God,\n\"Come, come, come, come.\" This was all he could do. How inadequate!\nBut each according to his own capacities, and he knew that his own\nwere small. \"One old Englishwoman and one little, little wasp,\" he\nthought, as he stepped out of the temple into the grey of a pouring\nwet morning. \"It does not seem much, still it is more than I am\nmyself.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ",

As he returned to his\nhouse   which stood in a pleasant garden further up the main street\nof the town   he could see his old patron paddling and capering in\nthe slush ahead. \"Hullo!\" he called, and it was the wrong remark,\nfor the devotee indicated by circular gestures of his arms that he\ndid not desire to be disturbed. He added, \"Sorry,\" which was right,\nfor Godbole twisted his head till it didn't belong to his body,\nand said in a strained voice that had no connection with his mind:\n\"He arrived at the European Guest House perhaps   at least possibly.\"\n\n\"Did he? Since when?\"\n\nBut time was too definite. He waved his arm more dimly and\ndisappeared. Aziz knew who \"he\" was   Fielding   but he refused to\nthink about him, because it disturbed his life, and he still\ntrusted the floods to prevent him from arriving. A fine little\nriver issued from his garden gate and gave him much hope. It was\nimpossible that anyone could get across from Deora in such weather\nas this. Fielding's visit was official. He had been transferred\nfrom Chandrapore, and sent on a tour through Central India to see\nwhat the remoter states were doing with regard to English education.\nHe had married, he had done the expected with Miss Quested, and\nAziz had no wish to see him again.\n\n\"Dear old Godbole,\" he thought, and smiled. He had no religious\ncuriosity, and had never discovered the meaning of this annual\nantic, but he was well assured that Godbole was a dear old man. He\nhad come to Mau through him and remained on his account. Without\nhim he could never have grasped problems so totally different from\nthose of Chandrapore. For here the cleavage was between Brahman\nand non-Brahman; Moslems and English were quite out of the running,\nand sometimes not mentioned for days. Since Godbole was a Brahman,\nAziz was one also for purposes of intrigue: they would often joke\nabout it together. The fissures in the Indian soil are infinite:\nHinduism, so solid from a distance, is riven into sects and clans,\nwhich radiate and join, and change their names according to the\naspect from which they are approached. Study it for years with the\nbest teachers, and when you raise your head, nothing they have told\nyou quite fits. Aziz, the day of his inauguration, had remarked:\n\"I study nothing, I respect\"   making an excellent impression. There\nwas now a minimum of prejudice against him. Nominally under a Hindu\ndoctor, he was really chief medicine man to the court. He had to\ndrop inoculation and such Western whims, but even at Chandrapore\nhis profession had been a game, centring round the operating table,\nand here in the backwoods he let his instruments rust, ran his\nlittle hospital at half steam, and caused no undue alarm.\n\nHis impulse to escape from the English was sound. They had\nfrightened him permanently, and there are only two reactions\nagainst fright: to kick and scream on committees, or to retreat to\na remote jungle, where the sahib seldom comes. His old lawyer\nfriends wanted him to stop in British India and help agitate, and\nmight have prevailed, but for the treachery of Fielding. The news\nhad not surprised him in the least. A rift had opened between them\nafter the trial when Cyril had not joined in his procession; those\nadvocacies of the girl had increased it; then came the post-cards\nfrom Venice, so cold, so unfriendly that all agreed that something\nwas wrong; and finally, after a silence, the expected letter from\nHampstead. Mahmoud Ali was with him at the time. \"Some news that\nwill surprise you. I am to marry someone whom you know. . .\" He\ndid not read further. \"Here it comes, answer for me      \" and he threw\nit to Mahmoud Ali. Subsequent letters he destroyed unopened. It\nwas the end of a foolish experiment. And though sometimes at the\nback of his mind he felt that Fielding had made sacrifices for him,\nit was now all confused with his genuine hatred of the English. \"I\nam an Indian at last,\" he thought, standing motionless in the rain.\n\nLife passed pleasantly, the climate was healthy so that the children\ncould be with him all the year round, and he had married again   not\nexactly a marriage, but he liked to regard it as one   and he read\nhis Persian, wrote his poetry, had his horse, and sometimes got\nsome shikar while the good Hindus looked the other way. His poems\nwere all on one topic   Oriental womanhood. \"The purdah must go,\"\nwas their burden, \"otherwise we shall never be free.\" And he\ndeclared (fantastically) that India would not have been conquered\nif women as well as men had fought at Plassy. \"But we do not show\nour women to the foreigner\"   not explaining how this was to be\nmanaged, for he was writing a poem. Bulbuls and roses would still\npersist, the pathos of defeated Islam remained in his blood and\ncould not be expelled by modernities. Illogical poems   like their\nwriter. Yet they struck a true note: there cannot be a mother-land\nwithout new homes. In one poem   the only one funny old Godbole\nliked   he had skipped over the mother-land (whom he did not truly\nlove) and gone straight to internationality. \"Ah, that is bhakti;\nah, my young friend, that is different and very good. Ah, India,\nwho seems not to move, will go straight there while the other\nnations waste their time. May I translate this particular one into\nHindi? In fact, it might be rendered into Sanskrit almost, it is\nso enlightened. Yes, of course, all your other poems are very good\ntoo. His Highness was saying to Colonel Maggs last time he came\nthat we are proud of you\"   simpering slightly.\n\nColonel Maggs was the Political Agent for the neighbourhood and\nAziz' dejected opponent. The Criminal Investigation Department kept\nan eye on Aziz ever since the trial   they had nothing actionable\nagainst him, but Indians who have been unfortunate must be watched,\nand to the end of his life he remained under observation, thanks\nto Miss Quested's mistake. Colonel Maggs learnt with concern that\na suspect was coming to Mau, and, adopting a playful manner,\nrallied the old Rajah for permitting a Moslem doctor to approach\nhis sacred person. A few years ago, the Rajah would have taken the\nhint, for the Political Agent then had been a formidable figure,\ndescending with all the thunders of Empire when it was most\ninconvenient, turning the polity inside out, requiring motor-cars\nand tiger-hunts, trees cut down that impeded the view from the\nGuest House, cows milked in his presence, and generally arrogating\nthe control of internal affairs. But there had been a change of\npolicy in high quarters. Local thunders were no longer endorsed,\nand the group of little states that composed the agency discovered\nthis and began comparing notes with fruitful result. To see how\nmuch, or how little, Colonel Maggs would stand, became an agreeable\ngame at Mau, which was played by all the departments of State. He\nhad to stand the appointment of Dr. Aziz. The Rajah did not take\nthe hint, but replied that Hindus were less exclusive than formerly,\nthanks to the enlightened commands of the Viceroy, and he felt it\nhis duty to move with the times.\n\nYes, all had gone well hitherto, but now, when the rest of the\nstate was plunged in its festival, he had a crisis of a very\ndifferent sort. A note awaited him at his house. There was no doubt\nthat Fielding had arrived overnight, nor much doubt that Godbole\nknew of his arrival, for the note was addressed to him, and he had\nread it before sending it on to Aziz, and had written in the\nmargin, \"Is not this delightful news, but unfortunately my religious\nduties prevent me from taking any action.\" Fielding announced that\nhe had inspected Mudkul (Miss Derek's former preserve), that he\nhad nearly been drowned at Deora, that he had reached Mau according\nto time-table, and hoped to remain there two days, studying the\nvarious educational innovations of his old friend. Nor had he come\nalone. His wife and her brother accompanied him. And then the note\nturned into the sort of note that always did arrive from the State\nGuest House. Wanting something. No eggs. Mosquito nets torn. When\nwould they pay their respects to His Highness? Was it correct that\na torchlight procession would take place? If so, might they view\nit? They didn't want to give trouble, but if they might stand in\na balcony, or if they might go out in a boat. . . . Aziz tore the\nnote up. He had had enough of showing Miss Quested native life.\nTreacherous hideous harridan! Bad people altogether. He hoped to\navoid them, though this might be difficult, for they would certainly\nbe held up for several days at Mau. Down country, the floods were\neven worse, and the pale grey faces of lakes had appeared in the\ndirection of the Asirgarh railway station.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

His mother said to him, \"Free prisoners.\" So he took\na sword and went up to the fort. He unlocked a door, and the\nprisoners streamed out and resumed their previous occupations, but\nthe police were too much annoyed and cut off the young man's head.\nIgnoring its absence, he made his way over the rocks that separate\nthe fort and the town, killing policemen as he went, and he fell\noutside his mother's house, having accomplished her orders.\nConsequently there are two shrines to him to-day   that of the Head\nabove, and that of the Body below   and they are worshipped by the\nfew Mohammedans who live near, and by Hindus also. \"There is no\nGod but God\"; that symmetrical injunction melts in the mild airs\nof Mau; it belongs to pilgrimages and universities, not to feudalism\nand agriculture. When Aziz arrived, and found that even Islam was\nidolatrous, he grew scornful, and longed to purify the place, like\nAlamgir. But soon he didn't mind, like Akbar. After all, this saint\nhad freed prisoners, and he himself had lain in prison. The Shrine\nof the Body lay in his own garden and produced a weekly crop of\nlamps and flowers, and when he saw them he recalled his sufferings.\nThe Shrine of the Head made a nice short walk for the children. He\nwas off duty the morning after the great pujah, and he told them\nto come. Jemila held his hand. Ahmed and Karim ran in front,\narguing what the body looked like as it came staggering down, and\nwhether they would have been frightened if they met it. He didn't\nwant them to grow up superstitious, so he rebuked them, and they\nanswered yes father, for they were well brought up, but, like\nhimself, they were impervious to argument, and after a polite pause\nthey continued saying what their natures compelled them to say.\n\nA slim, tall eight-sided building stood at the top of the slope,\namong some bushes. This was the Shrine of the Head. It had not been\nroofed, and was indeed merely a screen. Inside it crouched a humble\ndome, and inside that, visible through a grille, was a truncated\ngravestone, swathed in calico. The inner angles of the screen were\ncumbered with bees' nests, and a gentle shower of broken wings and\nother aerial oddments kept falling, and had strewn the damp pavement\nwith their flue. Ahmed, apprized by Mohammed Latif of the character\nof the bee, said, \"They will not hurt us, whose lives are chaste,\"\nand pushed boldly in; his sister was more cautious. From the shrine\nthey went to a mosque, which, in size and design, resembled a\nfire-screen; the arcades of Chandrapore had shrunk to a flat piece\nof ornamental stucco, with protuberances at either end to suggest\nminarets. The funny little thing didn't even stand straight, for\nthe rock on which it had been put was slipping down the hill. It,\nand the shrine, were a strange outcome of the protests of Arabia.\n\nThey wandered over the old fort, now deserted, and admired the\nvarious views. The scenery, according to their standards, was\ndelightful   the sky grey and black, bellyfuls of rain all over it,\nthe earth pocked with pools of water and slimy with mud. A\nmagnificent monsoon   the best for three years, the tanks already\nfull, bumper crops possible. Out towards the river (the route by\nwhich the Fieldings had escaped from Deora) the downpour had been\nenormous, the mails had to be pulled across by ropes. They could\njust see the break in the forest trees where the gorge came through,\nand the rocks above that marked the site of the diamond mine,\nglistening with wet. Close beneath was the suburban residence of\nthe Junior Rani, isolated by floods, and Her Highness, lax about\npurdah, to be seen paddling with her handmaidens in the garden and\nwaving her sari at the monkeys on the roof. But better not look\nclose beneath, perhaps   nor towards the European Guest House either.\nBeyond the Guest House rose another grey-green gloom of hills,\ncovered with temples like little white flames. There were over two\nhundred gods in that direction alone, who visited each other\nconstantly, and owned numerous cows, and all the betel-leaf\nindustry, besides having shares in the Asirgarh motor omnibus. Many\nof them were in the palace at this moment, having the time of their\nlives; others, too large or proud to travel, had sent symbols to\nrepresent them. The air was thick with religion and rain.\n\nTheir white shirts fluttering, Ahmed and Karim ran about over the\nfort, shrieking with joy. Presently they intersected a line of\nprisoners, who were looking aimlessly at an old bronze gun. \"Which\nof you is to be pardoned?\" they asked. For to-night was the\nprocession of the Chief God, when He would leave the palace,\nescorted by the whole power of the State, and pass by the Jail,\nwhich stood down in the town now. As He did so, troubling the\nwaters of our civilization, one prisoner would be released, and\nthen He would proceed to the great Mau tank that stretched as far\nas the Guest House garden, where something else would happen, some\nfinal or subsidiary apotheosis, after which He would submit to the\nexperience of sleep. The Aziz family did not grasp as much as this,\nbeing Moslem, but the visit to the Jail was common knowledge.\nSmiling, with downcast eyes, the prisoners discussed with the\ngentry their chances of salvation. Except for the irons on their\nlegs, they resembled other men, nor did they feel different. Five\nof them, who had not yet been brought to trial, could expect no\npardon, but all who had been convicted were full of hope. They did\nnot distinguish between the God and the Rajah in their minds, both\nwere too far above them; but the guard was better educated, and\nventured to enquire after His Highness's health.\n\n\"It always improves,\" replied the medicine man. As a matter of\nfact, the Rajah was dead, the ceremony overnight had overtaxed his\nstrength. His death was being concealed lest the glory of the\nfestival were dimmed. The Hindu physician, the Private Secretary,\nand a confidential servant remained with the corpse, while Aziz\nhad assumed the duty of being seen in public, and misleading\npeople. He had liked the ruler very much, and might not prosper\nunder his successor, yet he could not worry over such problems yet,\nfor he was involved in the illusion he helped to create. The\nchildren continued to run about, hunting for a frog to put in\nMohammed Latif's bed, the little fools. Hundreds of frogs lived in\ntheir own garden, but they must needs catch one up on the fort.\nThey reported two topis below. Fielding and his brother-in-law,\ninstead of resting after their journey, were climbing the slope to\nthe saint's tomb!\n\n\"Throw stones?\" asked Karim.\n\n\"Put powdered glass in their pan?\"\n\n\"Ahmed, come here for such wickedness.\" He raised his hand to smite\nhis firstborn, but allowed it to be kissed instead. It was sweet\nto have his sons with him at this moment, and to know they were\naffectionate and brave. He pointed out that the Englishmen were\nState guests, so must not be poisoned, and received, as always,\ngentle yet enthusiastic assent to his words.\n\nThe two visitors entered the octagon, but rushed out at once\npursued by some bees. Hither and thither they ran, beating their\nheads; the children shrieked with derision, and out of heaven, as\nif a plug had been pulled, fell a jolly dollop of rain. Aziz had\nnot meant to greet his former friend, but the incident put him into\nan excellent temper. He felt compact and strong. He shouted out,\n\"Hullo, gentlemen, are you in trouble?\"\n\nThe brother-in-law exclaimed; a bee had got him.\n\n\"Lie down in a pool of water, my dear sir   here are plenty. Don't\ncome near me. . . . I cannot control them, they are State bees;\ncomplain to His Highness of their behaviour.\" There was no real\ndanger, for the rain was increasing. The swarm retired to the\nshrine. He went up to the stranger and pulled a couple of stings\nout of his wrist, remarking, \"Come, pull yourself together and be\na man.\"\n\n\"How do you do, Aziz, after all this time? I heard you were settled\nin here,\" Fielding called to him, but not in friendly tones. \"I\nsuppose a couple of stings don't signify.\"\n\n\"Not the least. I'll send an embrocation over to the Guest House.\nI heard you were settled in there.\"\n\n\"Why have you not answered my letters?\" he asked, going straight\nfor the point, but not reaching it, owing to buckets of rain. His\ncompanion, new to the country, cried, as the drops drummed on his\ntopi, that the bees were renewing their attack. Fielding checked\nhis antics rather sharply, then said: \"Is there a short cut down\nto our carriage? We must give up our walk. The weather's\npestilential.\"\n\n\"Yes. That way.\"\n\n\"Are you not coming down yourself?\"\n\nAziz sketched a comic salaam; like all Indians, he was skilful in\nthe slighter impertinences. \"I tremble, I obey,\" the gesture said,\nand it was not lost upon Fielding. They walked down a rough path\nto the road   the two men first; the brother-in-law (boy rather than\nman) next, in a state over his arm, which hurt; the three Indian\nchildren last, noisy and impudent   all six wet through.\n\n\"How goes it, Aziz?\"\n\n\"In my usual health.\"\n\n\"Are you making anything out of your life here?\"\n\n\"How much do you make out of yours?\"\n\n\"Who is in charge of the Guest House?\" he asked, giving up his\nslight effort to recapture their intimacy, and growing more\nofficial; he was older and sterner.\n\n\"His Highness's Private Secretary, probably.\"\n\n\"Where is he, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Because not a soul's been near us since we arrived.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"I wrote beforehand to the Durbar, and asked if a visit was\nconvenient. I was told it was, and arranged my tour accordingly;\nbut the Guest House servants appear to have no definite instructions,\nwe can't get any eggs, also my wife wants to go out in the boat.\"\n\n\"There are two boats.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and no oars.\"\n\n\"Colonel Maggs broke the oars when here last.\"\n\n\"All four?\"\n\n\"He is a most powerful man.\"\n\n\"If the weather lifts, we want to see your torchlight procession\nfrom the water this evening,\" he pursued. \"I wrote to Godbole about\nit, but he has taken no notice; it's a place of the dead.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your letter never reached the Minister in question.\"\n\n\"Will there be any objection to English people watching the\nprocession?\"\n\n\"I know nothing at all about the religion here. I should never\nthink of watching it myself.\"\n\n\"We had a very different reception both at Mudkul and Deora, they\nwere kindness itself at Deora, the Maharajah and Maharani wanted\nus to see everything.\"\n\n\"You should never have left them.\"\n\n\"Jump in, Ralph\"   they had reached the carriage.\n\n\"Jump in, Mr. Quested, and Mr. Fielding.\"\n\n\"Who on earth is Mr. Quested?\"\n\n\"Do I mispronounce that well known name? Is he not your wife's\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Who on earth do you suppose I've married?\"\n\n\"I'm only Ralph Moore,\" said the boy, blushing, and at that moment\nthere fell another pailful of the rain, and made a mist round their\nfeet. Aziz tried to withdraw, but it was too late.\n\n\"Quested? Quested? Don't you know that my wife was Mrs. Moore's\ndaughter?\"\n\nHe trembled, and went purplish grey; he hated the news, hated\nhearing the name Moore.\n\n\"Perhaps this explains your odd attitude?\"\n\n\"And pray what is wrong with my attitude?\"\n\n\"The preposterous letter you allowed Mahmoud Ali to write for you.\"\n\n\"This is a very useless conversation, I consider.\"\n\n\"However did you make such a mistake?\" said Fielding, more friendly\nthan before, but scathing and scornful. \"It's almost unbelievable.\nI should think I wrote you half a dozen times, mentioning my wife\nby name. Miss Quested! What an extraordinary notion!\" From his\nsmile, Aziz guessed that Stella was beautiful. \"Miss Quested is\nour best friend, she introduced us, but . . . what an amazing\nnotion. Aziz, we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on.\nIt is clearly some devilry of Mahmoud Ali's. He knows perfectly\nwell I married Miss Moore. He called her    Heaslop's sister' in his\ninsolent letter to me.\"\n\nThe name woke furies in him. \"So she is, and here is Heaslop's\nbrother, and you his brother-in-law, and good-bye.\" Shame turned\ninto a rage that brought back his self-respect. \"What does it\nmatter to me who you marry? Don't trouble me here at Mau is all I\nask. I do not want you, I do not want one of you in my private\nlife, with my dying breath I say it. Yes, yes, I made a foolish\nblunder; despise me and feel cold. I thought you married my enemy.\nI never read your letter. Mahmoud Ali deceived me. I thought you'd\nstolen my money, but\"   he clapped his hands together, and his\nchildren gathered round him   \"it's as if you stole it. I forgive\nMahmoud Ali all things, because he loved me.\" Then pausing, while\nthe rain exploded like pistols, he said, \"My heart is for my own\npeople henceforward,\" and turned away. Cyril followed him through\nthe mud, apologizing, laughing a little, wanting to argue and\nreconstruct, pointing out with irrefragable logic that he had\nmarried, not Heaslop's betrothed, but Heaslop's sister. What\ndifference did it make at this hour of the day? He had built his\nlife on a mistake, but he had built it. Speaking in Urdu, that the\nchildren might understand, he said: \"Please do not follow us,\nwhomever you marry. I wish no Englishman or Englishwoman to be my\nfriend.\"\n\nHe returned to the house excited and happy. It had been an uneasy,\nuncanny moment when Mrs. Moore's name was mentioned, stirring\nmemories. \"Esmiss Esmoor . . .\"   as though she was coming to help\nhim. She had always been so good, and that youth whom he had\nscarcely looked at was her son, Ralph Moore, Stella and Ralph, whom\nhe had promised to be kind to, and Stella had married Cyril.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXXVI\n\n\nAll the time the palace ceased not to thrum and tum-tum. The\nrevelation was over, but its effect lasted, and its effect was to\nmake men feel that the revelation had not yet come. Hope existed\ndespite fulfilment, as it will be in heaven. Although the God had\nbeen born, His procession   loosely supposed by many to be the\nbirth   had not taken place. In normal years, the middle hours of\nthis day were signalized by performances of great beauty in the\nprivate apartments of the Rajah. He owned a consecrated troupe of\nmen and boys, whose duty it was to dance various actions and\nmeditations of his faith before him. Seated at his ease, he could\nwitness the Three Steps by which the Saviour ascended the universe\nto the discomfiture of Indra, also the death of the dragon, the\nmountain that turned into an umbrella, and the saddhu who (with\ncomic results) invoked the God before dining. All culminated in\nthe dance of the milkmaidens before Krishna, and in the still\ngreater dance of Krishna before the milkmaidens, when the music\nand the musicians swirled through the dark blue robes of the actors\ninto their tinsel crowns, and all became one. The Rajah and his\nguests would then forget that this was a dramatic performance, and\nwould worship the actors. Nothing of the sort could occur to-day,\nbecause death interrupts. It interrupted less here than in Europe,\nits pathos was less poignant, its irony less cruel. There were two\nclaimants to the throne, unfortunately, who were in the palace now\nand suspected what had happened, yet they made no trouble, because\nreligion is a living force to the Hindus, and can at certain\nmoments fling down everything that is petty and temporary in their\nnatures. The festival flowed on, wild and sincere, and all men\nloved each other, and avoided by instinct whatever could cause\ninconvenience or pain.\n\nAziz could not understand this, any more than an average Christian\ncould. He was puzzled that Mau should suddenly be purged from\nsuspicion and self-seeking. Although he was an outsider, and\nexcluded from their rites, they were always particularly charming\nto him at this time; he and his household received small courtesies\nand presents, just because he was outside. He had nothing to do\nall day, except to send the embrocation over to the Guest House,\nand towards sunset he remembered it, and looked round his house\nfor a local palliative, for the dispensary was shut. He found a\ntin of ointment belonging to Mohammed Latif, who was unwilling it\nshould be removed, for magic words had been spoken over it while\nit was being boiled down, but Aziz promised that he would bring it\nback after application to the stings: he wanted an excuse for a\nride.\n\nThe procession was beginning to form as he passed the palace. A\nlarge crowd watched the loading of the State palanquin, the prow\nof which protruded in the form of a silver dragon's head through\nthe lofty half-opened door. Gods, big and little, were getting\naboard. He averted his eyes, for he never knew how much he was\nsupposed to see, and nearly collided with the Minister of Education.\n\"Ah, you might make me late\"   meaning that the touch of a non-Hindu\nwould necessitate another bath; the words were spoken without moral\nheat. \"Sorry,\" said Aziz. The other smiled, and again mentioned\nthe Guest House party, and when he heard that Fielding's wife was\nnot Miss Quested after all, remarked \"Ah, no, he married the sister\nof Mr. Heaslop. Ah, exactly, I have known that for over a year\"   also\nwithout heat. \"Why did you not tell me? Your silence plunged me\ninto a pretty pickle.\" Godbole, who had never been known to tell\nanyone anything, smiled again, and said in deprecating tones:\n\"Never be angry with me. I am, as far as my limitations permit,\nyour true friend; besides, it is my holy festival.\" Aziz always\nfelt like a baby in that strange presence, a baby who unexpectedly\nreceives a toy. He smiled also, and turned his horse into a lane,\nfor the crush increased. The Sweepers' Band was arriving. Playing\non sieves and other emblems of their profession, they marched\nstraight at the gate of the palace with the air of a victorious\narmy. All other music was silent, for this was ritually the moment\nof the Despised and Rejected; the God could not issue from his\ntemple until the unclean Sweepers played their tune, they were the\nspot of filth without which the spirit cannot cohere. For an\ninstant the scene was magnificent. The doors were thrown open, and\nthe whole court was seen inside, barefoot and dressed in white\nrobes; in the fairway stood the Ark of the Lord, covered with cloth\nof gold and flanked by peacock fans and by stiff circular banners\nof crimson. It was full to the brim with statuettes and flowers.\nAs it rose from the earth on the shoulders of its bearers, the\nfriendly sun of the monsoons shone forth and flooded the world with\ncolour, so that the yellow tigers painted on the palace walls\nseemed to spring, and pink and green skeins of cloud to link up\nthe upper sky. The palanquin moved. . . . The lane was full of\nState elephants, who would follow it, their howdahs empty out of\nhumility. Aziz did not pay attention to these sanctities, for they\nhad no connection with his own; he felt bored, slightly cynical,\nlike his own dear Emperor Babur, who came down from the north and\nfound in Hindustan no good fruit, no fresh water or witty\nconversation, not even a friend.\n\nThe lane led quickly out of the town on to high rocks and jungle.\nHere he drew reign and examined the great Mau tank, which lay\nexposed beneath him to its remotest curve. Reflecting the evening\nclouds, it filled the nether-world with an equal splendour, so that\nearth and sky leant toward one another, about to clash in ecstasy.\nHe spat, cynical again, more cynical than before. For in the centre\nof the burnished circle a small black blot was advancing   the Guest\nHouse boat. Those English had improvised something to take the\nplace of oars, and were proceeding in their work of patrolling\nIndia. The sight endeared the Hindus by comparison, and looking\nback at the milk-white hump of the palace, he hoped that they would\nenjoy carrying their idol about, for at all events it did not pry\ninto other people's lives. This pose of \"seeing India\" which had\nseduced him to Miss Quested at Chandrapore was only a form of\nruling India; no sympathy lay behind it; he knew exactly what was\ngoing on in the boat as the party gazed at the steps down which\nthe image would presently descend, and debated how near they might\nrow without getting into trouble officially.\n\nHe did not give up his ride, for there would be servants at the\nGuest House whom he could question; a little information never\ncomes amiss. He took the path by the sombre promontory that\ncontained the royal tombs. Like the palace, they were of snowy\nstucco, and gleamed by their internal light, but their radiance\ngrew ghostly under approaching night. The promontory was covered\nwith lofty trees, and the fruit-bats were unhooking from the boughs\nand making kissing sounds as they grazed the surface of the tank;\nhanging upside down all the day, they had grown thirsty. The signs\nof the contented Indian evening multiplied; frogs on all sides,\ncow-dung burning eternally; a flock of belated hornbills overhead,\nlooking like winged skeletons as they flapped across the gloaming.\nThere was death in the air, but not sadness; a compromise had been\nmade between destiny and desire, and even the heart of man\nacquiesced.\n\nThe European Guest House stood two hundred feet above the water,\non the crest of a rocky and wooded spur that jutted from the\njungle. By the time Aziz arrived, the water had paled to a film of\nmauve-grey, and the boat vanished entirely. A sentry slept in the\nGuest House porch, lamps burned in the cruciform of the deserted\nrooms. He went from one room to another, inquisitive, and malicious.\nTwo letters lying on the piano rewarded him, and he pounced and\nread them promptly. He was not ashamed to do this. The sanctity of\nprivate correspondence has never been ratified by the East.\nMoreover, Mr. McBryde had read all his letters in the past, and\nspread their contents. One letter   the more interesting of the\ntwo   was from Heaslop to Fielding. It threw light on the mentality\nof his former friend, and it hardened him further against him. Much\nof it was about Ralph Moore, who appeared to be almost an imbecile.\n\"Hand on my brother whenever suits you. I write to you because he\nis sure to make a bad bunderbust.\" Then: \"I quite agree   life is\ntoo short to cherish grievances, also I'm relieved you feel able\nto come into line with the Oppressors of India to some extent. We\nneed all the support we can get. I hope that next time Stella comes\nmy way she will bring you with her, when I will make you as\ncomfortable as a bachelor can   it's certainly time we met. My\nsister's marriage to you coming after my mother's death and my own\ndifficulties did upset me, and I was unreasonable. It is about time\nwe made it up properly, as you say   let us leave it at faults on\nboth sides. Glad about your son and heir. When next any of you\nwrite to Adela, do give her some sort of message from me, for I\nshould like to make my peace with her too. You are lucky to be out\nof British India at the present moment. Incident after incident,\nall due to propaganda, but we can't lay our hands on the connecting\nthread. The longer one lives here, the more certain one gets that\neverything hangs together. My personal opinion is, it's the Jews.\"\n\nThus far the red-nosed boy. Aziz was distracted for a moment by\nblurred sounds coming from over the water; the procession was under\nway. The second letter was from Miss Quested to Mrs. Fielding. It\ncontained one or two interesting touches. The writer hoped that\n\"Ralph will enjoy his India more than I did mine,\" and appeared to\nhave given him money for this purpose   \"my debt which I shall never\nrepay in person.\" What debt did Miss Quested imagine she owed the\ncountry? He did not relish the phrase. Talk of Ralph's health. It\nwas all \"Stella and Ralph,\" even \"Cyril\" and \"Ronny\"   all so friendly\nand sensible, and written in a spirit he could not command. He\nenvied the easy intercourse that is only possible in a nation whose\nwomen are free. These five people were making up their little\ndifficulties, and closing their broken ranks against the alien.\nEven Heaslop was coming in. Hence the strength of England, and in\na spurt of temper he hit the piano, and since the notes had swollen\nand stuck together in groups of threes, he produced a remarkable\nnoise.\n\n\"Oh, oh, who is that?\" said a nervous and respectful voice; he\ncould not remember where he had heard its tones before. Something\nmoved in the twilight of an adjoining room. He replied, \"State\ndoctor, ridden over to enquire, very little English,\" slipped the\nletters into his pocket, and to show that he had free entry to the\nGuest House, struck the piano again.\n\nRalph Moore came into the light.\n\nWhat a strange-looking youth, tall, prematurely aged, the big blue\neyes faded with anxiety, the hair impoverished and tousled! Not a\ntype that is often exported imperially. The doctor in Aziz thought,\n\"Born of too old a mother,\" the poet found him rather beautiful.\n\n\"I was unable to call earlier owing to pressure of work. How are\nthe celebrated bee-stings?\" he asked patronizingly.\n\n\"I   I was resting, they thought I had better; they throb rather.\"\n\nHis timidity and evident \"newness\" had complicated effects on the\nmalcontent. Speaking threateningly, he said, \"Come here, please,\nallow me to look.\" They were practically alone, and he could treat\nthe patient as Callendar had treated Nureddin.\n\n\"You said this morning      \"\n\n\"The best of doctors make mistakes. Come here, please, for the\ndiagnosis under the lamp. I am pressed for time.\"\n\n\"Aough      \"\n\n\"What is the matter, pray?\"\n\n\"Your hands are unkind.\"\n\nHe started and glanced down at them. The extraordinary youth was\nright, and he put them behind his back before replying with outward\nanger: \"What the devil have my hands to do with you? This is a most\nstrange remark. I am a qualified doctor, who will not hurt you.\"\n\n\"I don't mind pain, there is no pain.\"\n\n\"No pain?\"\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\n\"Excellent news,\" sneered Aziz.\n\n\"But there is cruelty.\"\n\n\"I have brought you some salve, but how to put it on in your\npresent nervous state becomes a problem,\" he continued, after a\npause.\n\n\"Please leave it with me.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. It returns to my dispensary at once.\" He stretched\nforward, and the other retreated to the farther side of a table.\n\"Now, do you want me to treat your stings, or do you prefer an\nEnglish doctor? There is one at Asirgarh. Asirgarh is forty miles\naway, and the Ringnod dam broken. Now you see how you are placed.\nI think I had better see Mr. Fielding about you; this is really\ngreat nonsense, your present behaviour.\"\n\n\"They are out in a boat,\" he replied, glancing about him for\nsupport.\n\nAziz feigned intense surprise. \"They have not gone in the direction\nof Mau, I hope. On a night like this the people become most\nfanatical.\" And, as if to confirm him, there was a sob, as though\nthe lips of a giant had parted; the procession was approaching the\nJail.\n\n\"You should not treat us like this,\" he challenged, and this time\nAziz was checked, for the voice, though frightened, was not weak.\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Dr. Aziz, we have done you no harm.\"\n\n\"Aha, you know my name, I see. Yes, I am Aziz. No, of course your\ngreat friend Miss Quested did me no harm at the Marabar.\"\n\nDrowning his last words, all the guns of the State went off. A\nrocket from the Jail garden gave the signal. The prisoner had been\nreleased, and was kissing the feet of the singers. Rose-leaves fall\nfrom the houses, sacred spices and coco-nut are brought forth. . . .\nIt was the half-way moment; the God had extended His temple,\nand paused exultantly. Mixed and confused in their passage, the\nrumours of salvation entered the Guest House. They were startled\nand moved on to the porch, drawn by the sudden illumination. The\nbronze gun up on the fort kept flashing, the town was a blur of\nlight, in which the houses seemed dancing, and the palace waving\nlittle wings. The water below, the hills and sky above, were not\ninvolved as yet; there was still only a little light and song\nstruggling among the shapeless lumps of the universe. The song\nbecame audible through much repetition; the choir was repeating\nand inverting the names of deities.\n\n  \"Radhakrishna Radhakrishna,\n   Radhakrishna Radhakrishna,\n   Krishnaradha Radhakrishna,\n   Radhakrishna Radhakrishna,\"\n\nthey sang, and woke the sleeping sentry in the Guest House; he\nleant upon his iron-tipped spear.\n\n\"I must go back now, good night,\" said Aziz, and held out his hand,\ncompletely forgetting that they were not friends, and focusing his\nheart on something more distant than the caves, something beautiful.\nHis hand was taken, and then he remembered how detestable he had\nbeen, and said gently, \"Don't you think me unkind any more?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How can you tell, you strange fellow?\"\n\n\"Not difficult, the one thing I always know.\"\n\n\"Can you always tell whether a stranger is your friend?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you are an Oriental.\" He unclasped as he spoke, with a little\nshudder. Those words   he had said them to Mrs. Moore in the mosque\nin the beginning of the cycle, from which, after so much suffering,\nhe had got free. Never be friends with the English! Mosque, caves,\nmosque, caves. And here he was starting again. He handed the magic\nointment to him. \"Take this, think of me when you use it. I shall\nnever want it back. I must give you one little present, and it is\nall I have got; you are Mrs. Moore's son.\"\n\n\"I am that,\" he murmured to himself; and a part of Aziz' mind that\nhad been hidden seemed to move and force its way to the top.\n\n\"But you are Heaslop's brother also, and alas, the two nations\ncannot be friends.\"\n\n\"I know. Not yet.\"\n\n\"Did your mother speak to you about me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" And with a swerve of voice and body that Aziz did not follow\nhe added, \"In her letters, in her letters. She loved you.\"\n\n\"Yes, your mother was my best friend in all the world.\" He was\nsilent, puzzled by his own great gratitude. What did this eternal\ngoodness of Mrs. Moore amount to? To nothing, if brought to the\ntest of thought. She had not borne witness in his favour, nor\nvisited him in the prison, yet she had stolen to the depths of his\nheart, and he always adored her. \"This is our monsoon, the best\nweather,\" he said, while the lights of the procession waved as\nthough embroidered on an agitated curtain. \"How I wish she could\nhave seen them, our rains. Now is the time when all things are\nhappy, young and old. They are happy out there with their savage\nnoise, though we cannot follow them; the tanks are all full so they\ndance, and this is India. I wish you were not with officials, then\nI would show you my country, but I cannot. Perhaps I will just take\nyou out on the water now, for one short half-hour.\"\n\nWas the cycle beginning again? His heart was too full to draw back.\nHe must slip out in the darkness, and do this one act of homage to\nMrs. Moore's son. He knew where the oars were   hidden to deter the\nvisitors from going out   and he brought the second pair, in case\nthey met the other boat; the Fieldings had pushed themselves out\nwith long poles, and might get into difficulties, for the wind was\nrising.\n\nOnce on the water, he became easy. One kind action was with him\nalways a channel for another, and soon the torrent of his\nhospitality gushed forth and he began doing the honours of Mau and\npersuading himself that he understood the wild procession, which\nincreased in lights and sounds as the complications of its ritual\ndeveloped. There was little need to row, for the freshening gale\nblew them in the direction they desired. Thorns scratched the keel,\nthey ran into an islet and startled some cranes. The strange\ntemporary life of the August flood-water bore them up and seemed\nas though it would last for ever.\n\nThe boat was a rudderless dinghy. Huddled up in the stern, with\nthe spare pair of oars in his arms, the guest asked no questions\nabout details. There was presently a flash of lightning, followed\nby a second flash   little red scratches on the ponderous sky. \"Was\nthat the Rajah?\" he asked.\n\n\"What   what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Row back.\"\n\n\"But there's no Rajah   nothing      \"\n\n\"Row back, you will see what I mean.\"\n\nAziz found it hard work against the advancing wind. But he fixed\nhis eyes on the pin of light that marked the Guest House and backed\na few strokes.\n\n\"There . . .\"\n\nFloating in the darkness was a king, who sat under a canopy, in\nshining royal robes. . . .\n\n\"I can't tell you what that is, I'm sure,\" he whispered. \"His\nHighness is dead. I think we should go back at once.\"\n\nThey were close to the promontory of the tombs, and had looked\nstraight into the chhatri of the Rajah's father through an opening\nin the trees. That was the explanation. He had heard of the\nimage   made to imitate life at enormous expense   but he had never\nchanced to see it before, though he frequently rowed on the lake.\nThere was only one spot from which it could be seen, and Ralph had\ndirected him to it. Hastily he pulled away, feeling that his\ncompanion was not so much a visitor as a guide. He remarked, \"Shall\nwe go back now?\"\n\n\"There is still the procession.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not go nearer   they have such strange customs, and might\nhurt you.\"\n\n\"A little nearer.\"\n\nAziz obeyed. He knew with his heart that this was Mrs. Moore's son,\nand indeed until his heart was involved he knew nothing.\n\"Radhakrishna Radhakrishna Radhakrishna Radhakrishna Krishnaradha,\"\nwent the chant, then suddenly changed, and in the interstice he\nheard, almost certainly, the syllables of salvation that had\nsounded during his trial at Chandrapore.\n\n\"Mr. Moore, don't tell anyone that the Rajah is dead. It is a\nsecret still, I am supposed not to say. We pretend he is alive\nuntil after the festival, to prevent unhappiness. Do you want to\ngo still nearer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe tried to keep the boat out of the glare of the torches that\nbegan to star the other shore. Rockets kept going off, also the\nguns. Suddenly, closer than he had calculated, the palanquin of\nKrishna appeared from behind a ruined wall, and descended the\ncarven glistening water-steps. On either side of it the singers\ntumbled, a woman prominent, a wild and beautiful young saint with\nflowers in her hair. She was praising God without attributes   thus\ndid she apprehend Him. Others praised Him without attributes,\nseeing Him in this or that organ of the body or manifestation of\nthe sky. Down they rushed to the foreshore and stood in the small\nwaves, and a sacred meal was prepared, of which those who felt\nworthy partook. Old Godbole detected the boat, which was drifting\nin on the gale, and he waved his arms   whether in wrath or joy Aziz\nnever discovered. Above stood the secular power of Mau   elephants,\nartillery, crowds   and high above them a wild tempest started,\nconfined at first to the upper regions of the air. Gusts of wind\nmixed darkness and light, sheets of rain cut from the north,\nstopped, cut from the south, began rising from below, and across\nthem struggled the singers, sounding every note but terror, and\npreparing to throw God away, God Himself, (not that God can be\nthrown) into the storm. Thus was He thrown year after year, and\nwere others thrown   little images of Ganpati, baskets of ten-day\ncorn, tiny tazias after Mohurram   scapegoats, husks, emblems of\npassage; a passage not easy, not now, not here, not to be\napprehended except when it is unattainable; the God to be thrown\nwas an emblem of that.\n\nThe village of Gokul reappeared upon its tray. It was the substitute\nfor the silver image, which never left its haze of flowers; on\nbehalf of another symbol, it was to perish. A servitor took it in\nhis hands, and tore off the blue and white streamers. He was naked,\nbroad-shouldered, thin-waisted   the Indian body again triumphant   and\nit was his hereditary office to close the gates of salvation. He\nentered the dark waters, pushing the village before him, until the\nclay dolls slipped off their chairs and began to gutter in the\nrain, and King Kansa was confounded with the father and mother of\nthe Lord. Dark and solid, the little waves sipped, then a great\nwave washed and then English voices cried \"Take care!\"\n\nThe boats had collided with each other.\n\nThe four outsiders flung out their arms and grappled, and, with\noars and poles sticking out, revolved like a mythical monster in\nthe whirlwind. The worshippers howled with wrath or joy, as they\ndrifted forward helplessly against the servitor. Who awaited them,\nhis beautiful dark face expressionless, and as the last morsels\nmelted on his tray, it struck them.\n\nThe shock was minute, but Stella, nearest to it, shrank into her\nhusband's arms, then reached forward, then flung herself against\nAziz, and her motions capsized them. They plunged into the warm,\nshallow water, and rose struggling into a tornado of noise. The\noars, the sacred tray, the letters of Ronny and Adela, broke loose\nand floated confusedly. Artillery was fired, drums beaten, the\nelephants trumpeted, and drowning all an immense peal of thunder,\nunaccompanied by lightning, cracked like a mallet on the dome.\n\nThat was the climax, as far as India admits of one. The rain\nsettled in steadily to its job of wetting everybody and everything\nthrough, and soon spoiled the cloth of gold on the palanquin and\nthe costly disc-shaped banners. Some of the torches went out,\nfireworks didn't catch, there began to be less singing, and the\ntray returned to Professor Godbole, who picked up a fragment of\nthe mud adhering and smeared it on his forehead without much\nceremony. Whatever had happened had happened, and while the\nintruders picked themselves up, the crowds of Hindus began a\ndesultory move back into the town. The image went back too, and on\nthe following day underwent a private death of its own, when some\ncurtains of magenta and green were lowered in front of the dynastic\nshrine. The singing went on even longer . . . ragged edges of\nreligion . . . unsatisfactory and undramatic tangles. . . . \"God\nis love.\" Looking back at the great blur of the last twenty-four\nhours, no man could say where was the emotional centre of it, any\nmore than he could locate the heart of a cloud.\n\n\n\n\n  ",

        "raw text": " XXXVII\n\n\nFriends again, yet aware that they could meet no more, Aziz and\nFielding went for their last ride in the Mau jungles. The floods\nhad abated and the Rajah was officially dead, so the Guest House\nparty were departing next morning, as decorum required. What with\nthe mourning and the festival, the visit was a failure.\n\nFielding had scarcely seen Godbole, who promised every day to show\nhim over the King-Emperor George Fifth High School, his main\nobjective, but always made some excuse. This afternoon Aziz let\nout what had happened: the King-Emperor had been converted into a\ngranary, and the Minister of Education did not like to admit this\nto his former Principal. The school had been opened only last year\nby the Agent to the Governor-General, and it still flourished on\npaper; he hoped to start it again before its absence was remarked\nand to collect its scholars before they produced children of their\nown. Fielding laughed at the tangle and waste of energy, but he\ndid not travel as lightly as in the past; education was a continuous\nconcern to him, because his income and the comfort of his family\ndepended on it. He knew that few Indians think education good in\nitself, and he deplored this now on the widest grounds. He began\nto say something heavy on the subject of Native States, but the\nfriendliness of Aziz distracted him. This reconciliation was a\nsuccess, anyhow. After the funny shipwreck there had been no more\nnonsense or bitterness, and they went back laughingly to their old\nrelationship as if nothing had happened. Now they rode between\njolly bushes and rocks. Presently the ground opened into full\nsunlight and they saw a grassy slope bright with butterflies, also\na cobra, which crawled across doing nothing in particular, and\ndisappeared among some custard apple trees. There were round white\nclouds in the sky, and white pools on the earth; the hills in the\ndistance were purple. The scene was as park-like as England, but\ndid not cease being queer. They drew rein, to give the cobra\nelbow-room, and Aziz produced a letter that he wanted to send to\nMiss Quested. A charming letter. He wanted to thank his old enemy\nfor her fine behaviour two years back: perfectly plain was it now\nthat she had behaved well. \"As I fell into our largest Mau tank\nunder circumstances our other friends will relate, I thought how\nbrave Miss Quested was, and decided to tell her so, despite my\nimperfect English. Through you I am happy here with my children\ninstead of in a prison, of that I make no doubt. My children shall\nbe taught to speak of you with the greatest affection and respect.\"\n\n\"Miss Quested will be greatly pleased. I am glad you have seen her\ncourage at last.\"\n\n\"I want to do kind actions all round and wipe out the wretched\nbusiness of the Marabar for ever. I have been so disgracefully\nhasty, thinking you meant to get hold of my money: as bad a mistake\nas the cave itself.\"\n\n\"Aziz, I wish you would talk to my wife. She too believes that the\nMarabar is wiped out.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"I don't know, perhaps she might tell you, she won't tell me. She\nhas ideas I don't share   indeed, when I'm away from her I think them\nridiculous. When I'm with her, I suppose because I'm fond of her,\nI feel different, I feel half dead and half blind. My wife's after\nsomething. You and I and Miss Quested are, roughly speaking, not\nafter anything. We jog on as decently as we can, you a little in\nfront   a laudable little party. But my wife is not with us.\"\n\n\"What are you meaning? Is Stella not faithful to you, Cyril? This\nfills me with great concern.\"\n\nFielding hesitated. He was not quite happy about his marriage. He\nwas passionate physically again   the final flare-up before the\nclinkers of middle age   and he knew that his wife did not love him\nas much as he loved her, and he was ashamed of pestering her. But\nduring the visit to Mau the situation had improved. There seemed\na link between them at last   that link outside either participant\nthat is necessary to every relationship. In the language of\ntheology, their union had been blessed. He could assure Aziz that\nStella was not only faithful to him, but likely to become more so;\nand trying to express what was not clear to himself, he added dully\nthat different people had different points of view. \"If you won't\ntalk about the Marabar to Stella, why won't you talk to Ralph? He\nis a wise boy really. And (same metaphor) he rides a little behind\nher, though with her.\"\n\n\"Tell him also, I have nothing to say to him, but he is indeed a\nwise boy and has always one Indian friend. I partly love him\nbecause he brought me back to you to say good-bye. For this is\ngood-bye, Cyril, though to think about it will spoil our ride and\nmake us sad.\"\n\n\"No, we won't think about it.\" He too felt that this was their last\nfree intercourse. All the stupid misunderstandings had been cleared\nup, but socially they had no meeting-place. He had thrown in his\nlot with Anglo-India by marrying a countrywoman, and he was\nacquiring some of its limitations, and already felt surprise at\nhis own past heroism. Would he to-day defy all his own people for\nthe sake of a stray Indian? Aziz was a memento, a trophy, they were\nproud of each other, yet they must inevitably part. And, anxious\nto make what he could of this last afternoon, he forced himself to\nspeak intimately about his wife, the person most dear to him. He\nsaid: \"From her point of view, Mau has been a success. It calmed\nher   both of them suffer from restlessness. She found something\nsoothing, some solution of her queer troubles here.\" After a\nsilence   myriads of kisses around them as the earth drew the water\nin   he continued: \"Do you know anything about this Krishna business?\"\n\n\"My dear chap, officially they call it Gokul Ashtami. All the State\noffices are closed, but how else should it concern you and me?\"\n\n\"Gokul is the village where Krishna was born   well, more or less\nborn, for there's the same hovering between it and another village\nas between Bethlehem and Nazareth. What I want to discover is its\nspiritual side, if it has one.\"\n\n\"It is useless discussing Hindus with me. Living with them teaches\nme no more. When I think I annoy them, I do not. When I think I\ndon't annoy them, I do. Perhaps they will sack me for tumbling on\nto their dolls'-house; on the other hand, perhaps they will double\nmy salary. Time will prove. Why so curious about them?\"\n\n\"It's difficult to explain. I never really understood or liked\nthem, except an occasional scrap of Godbole. Does the old fellow\nstill say    Come, come?'\"\n\n\"Oh, presumably.\"\n\nFielding sighed, opened his lips, shut them, then said with a\nlittle laugh, \"I can't explain, because it isn't in words at all,\nbut why do my wife and her brother like Hinduism, though they take\nno interest in its forms? They won't talk to me about this. They\nknow I think a certain side of their lives is a mistake, and are\nshy. That's why I wish you would talk to them, for at all events\nyou're Oriental.\"\n\nAziz refused to reply. He didn't want to meet Stella and Ralph\nagain, knew they didn't want to meet him, was incurious about their\nsecrets, and felt good old Cyril to be a bit clumsy. Something   not\na sight, but a sound   flitted past him, and caused him to re-read\nhis letter to Miss Quested. Hadn't he wanted to say something else\nto her? Taking out his pen, he added: \"For my own part, I shall\nhenceforth connect you with the name that is very sacred in my\nmind, namely, Mrs. Moore.\" When he had finished, the mirror of the\nscenery was shattered, the meadow disintegrated into butterflies.\nA poem about Mecca   the Caaba of Union   the thorn-bushes where\npilgrims die before they have seen the Friend   they flitted next;\nhe thought of his wife; and then the whole semi-mystic, semi-sensuous\noverturn, so characteristic of his spiritual life, came to end like\na landslip and rested in its due place, and he found himself riding\nin the jungle with his dear Cyril.\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" he said. \"Don't spoil our last hour with foolish\nquestions. Leave Krishna alone, and talk about something sensible.\"\n\nThey did. All the way back to Mau they wrangled about politics.\nEach had hardened since Chandrapore, and a good knock about proved\nenjoyable. They trusted each other, although they were going to\npart, perhaps because they were going to part. Fielding had \"no\nfurther use for politeness,\" he said, meaning that the British\nEmpire really can't be abolished because it's rude. Aziz retorted,\n\"Very well, and we have no use for you,\" and glared at him with\nabstract hate. Fielding said: \"Away from us, Indians go to seed at\nonce. Look at the King-Emperor High School! Look at you, forgetting\nyour medicine and going back to charms. Look at your poems.\"   \"Jolly\ngood poems, I'm getting published Bombay side.\"   \"Yes, and what do\nthey say? Free our women and India will be free. Try it, my lad.\nFree your own lady in the first place, and see who'll wash Ahmed\nKarim and Jamila's faces. A nice situation!\"\n\nAziz grew more excited. He rose in his stirrups and pulled at his\nhorse's head in the hope it would rear. Then he should feel in a\nbattle. He cried: \"Clear out, all you Turtons and Burtons. We\nwanted to know you ten years back   now it's too late. If we see you\nand sit on your committees, it's for political reasons, don't you\nmake any mistake.\" His horse did rear. \"Clear out, clear out, I\nsay. Why are we put to so much suffering? We used to blame you,\nnow we blame ourselves, we grow wiser. Until England is in\ndifficulties we keep silent, but in the next European war   aha, aha!\nThen is our time.\" He paused, and the scenery, though it smiled,\nfell like a gravestone on any human hope. They cantered past a\ntemple to Hanuman   God so loved the world that he took monkey's\nflesh upon him   and past a Saivite temple, which invited to lust,\nbut under the semblance of eternity, its obscenities bearing no\nrelation to those of our flesh and blood. They splashed through\nbutterflies and frogs; great trees with leaves like plates rose\namong the brushwood. The divisions of daily life were returning,\nthe shrine had almost shut.\n\n\"Who do you want instead of the English? The Japanese?\" jeered\nFielding, drawing rein.\n\n\"No, the Afghans. My own ancestors.\"\n\n\"Oh, your Hindu friends will like that, won't they?\"\n\n\"It will be arranged   a conference of Oriental statesmen.\"\n\n\"It will indeed be arranged.\"\n\n\"Old story of    We will rob every man and rape every woman from\nPeshawar to Calcutta,' I suppose, which you get some nobody to\nrepeat and then quote every week in the _Pioneer_ in order to\nfrighten us into retaining you! We know!\" Still he couldn't quite\nfit in Afghans at Mau, and, finding he was in a corner, made his\nhorse rear again until he remembered that he had, or ought to have,\na mother-land. Then he shouted: \"India shall be a nation! No\nforeigners of any sort! Hindu and Moslem and Sikh and all shall be\none! Hurrah! Hurrah for India! Hurrah! Hurrah!\"\n\nIndia a nation! What an apotheosis! Last comer to the drab\nnineteenth-century sisterhood! Waddling in at this hour of the\nworld to take her seat! She, whose only peer was the Holy Roman\nEmpire, she shall rank with Guatemala and Belgium perhaps! Fielding\nmocked again. And Aziz in an awful rage danced this way and that,\nnot knowing what to do, and cried: \"Down with the English anyhow.\nThat's certain. Clear out, you fellows, double quick, I say. We\nmay hate one another, but we hate you most. If I don't make you\ngo, Ahmed will, Karim will, if it's fifty five-hundred years we\nshall get rid of you, yes, we shall drive every blasted Englishman\ninto the sea, and then\"   he rode against him furiously   \"and then,\"\nhe concluded, half kissing him, \"you and I shall be friends.\"\n\n\"Why can't we be friends now?\" said the other, holding him\naffectionately. \"It's what I want. It's what you want.\"\n\nBut the horses didn't want it   they swerved apart; the earth didn't\nwant it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single\nfile; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the\ncarrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from\nthe gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in\ntheir hundred voices, \"No, not yet,\" and the sky said, \"No, not\nthere.\"\n\n  Weybridge, 1924.\n\n\n\n\n  [END]",
