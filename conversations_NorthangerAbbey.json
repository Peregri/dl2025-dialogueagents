        "raw text": " 2\n\n\nIn addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland s\npersonal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the\ndifficulties and dangers of a six weeks  residence in Bath, it may be\nstated, for the reader s more certain information, lest the following\npages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is\nmeant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful\nand open, without conceit or affectation of any kind her manners just\nremoved from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person\npleasing, and, when in good looks, pretty and her mind about as\nignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.\n\nWhen the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs.\nMorland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand\nalarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this\nterrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her\nin tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of\nthe most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her\nwise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions against\nthe violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young\nladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve\nthe fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew\nso little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of\ntheir general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to\nher daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the\nfollowing points. \"I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up\nvery warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and\nI wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I\nwill give you this little book on purpose.\"\n\nSally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility will\nreach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?),\nmust from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante\nof her sister. It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted on\nCatherine s writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of\ntransmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail of\nevery interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything\nindeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the\nMorlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed\nrather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with\nthe refined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first\nseparation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her\nfather, instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even\nputting an hundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten\nguineas, and promised her more when she wanted it.\n\nUnder these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the\njourney began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful\nsafety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky\noverturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred\nthan a fear, on Mrs. Allen s side, of having once left her clogs behind\nher at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\n\nThey arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight her eyes were\nhere, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking\nenvirons, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted\nthem to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy\nalready.\n\nThey were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.\n\nIt is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the\nreader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter\ntend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will,\nprobably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate\nwretchedness of which a last volume is capable whether by her\nimprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy whether by intercepting her letters,\nruining her character, or turning her out of doors.\n\nMrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can\nraise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the\nworld who could like them well enough to marry them. She had neither\nbeauty, genius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a\ngreat deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind\nwere all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible,\nintelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was admirably fitted\nto introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going\neverywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be.\nDress was her passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine;\nand our heroine s entree into life could not take place till after\nthree or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and\nher chaperone was provided with a dress of the newest fashion.\nCatherine too made some purchases herself, and when all these matters\nwere arranged, the important evening came which was to usher her into\nthe Upper Rooms. Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her\nclothes put on with care, and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she\nlooked quite as she should do. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped\nat least to pass uncensured through the crowd. As for admiration, it\nwas always very welcome when it came, but she did not depend on it.\n\nMrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom\ntill late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies\nsqueezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaired\ndirectly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.\nWith more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of\nher protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the\ndoor, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,\nhowever, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within\nher friend s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling\nassembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along\nthe room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the\ncrowd; it seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had\nimagined that when once fairly within the door, they should easily find\nseats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But\nthis was far from being the case, and though by unwearied diligence\nthey gained even the top of the room, their situation was just the\nsame; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of\nthe ladies. Still they moved on something better was yet in view; and\nby a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves\nat last in the passage behind the highest bench. Here there was\nsomething less of crowd than below; and hence Miss Morland had a\ncomprehensive view of all the company beneath her, and of all the\ndangers of her late passage through them. It was a splendid sight, and\nshe began, for the first time that evening, to feel herself at a ball:\nshe longed to dance, but she had not an acquaintance in the room. Mrs.\nAllen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly,\nevery now and then, \"I wish you could dance, my dear I wish you could\nget a partner.\" For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for\nthese wishes; but they were repeated so often, and proved so totally\nineffectual, that Catherine grew tired at last, and would thank her no\nmore.\n\nThey were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence\nthey had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion for\ntea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feel\nsomething of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed\nagainst by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to\ninterest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she\ncould not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a\nsyllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in\nthe tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to\njoin, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They saw\nnothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more\neligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at\nwhich a large party were already placed, without having anything to do\nthere, or anybody to speak to, except each other.\n\nMrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on\nhaving preserved her gown from injury. \"It would have been very\nshocking to have it torn,\" said she, \"would not it? It is such a\ndelicate muslin. For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in\nthe whole room, I assure you.\"\n\n\"How uncomfortable it is,\" whispered Catherine, \"not to have a single\nacquaintance here!\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, \"it is very\nuncomfortable indeed.\"\n\n\"What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if\nthey wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their\nparty.\"\n\n\"Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large\nacquaintance here.\"\n\n\"I wish we had _any;_ it would be somebody to go to.\"\n\n\"Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them\ndirectly. The Skinners were here last year I wish they were here now.\"\n\n\"Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you\nsee.\"\n\n\"No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had\nbetter sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my\nhead, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure\nthere is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you\n_must_ know somebody.\"\n\n\"I don t, upon my word I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance\nhere with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should\nbe so glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What\nan odd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.\"\n\nAfter some time they received an offer of tea from one of their\nneighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light\nconversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time\nthat anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were\ndiscovered and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over.\n\n\"Well, Miss Morland,\" said he, directly, \"I hope you have had an\nagreeable ball.\"\n\n\"Very agreeable indeed,\" she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a\ngreat yawn.\n\n\"I wish she had been able to dance,\" said his wife; \"I wish we could\nhave got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be if\nthe Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys\nhad come, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George\nParry. I am so sorry she has not had a partner!\"\n\n\"We shall do better another evening I hope,\" was Mr. Allen s\nconsolation.\n\nThe company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave\nspace for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the\ntime for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part in\nthe events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every five\nminutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her\ncharms. She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her\nbefore. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding\nher, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she once\ncalled a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and\nhad the company only seen her three years before, they would _now_ have\nthought her exceedingly handsome.\n\nShe _was_ looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her own\nhearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl. Such words\nhad their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter\nthan she had found it before her humble vanity was contented she felt\nmore obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a\ntrue-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration\nof her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and\nperfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 3\n\n\nEvery morning now brought its regular duties shops were to be visited;\nsome new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be\nattended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at\neverybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintance\nin Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it after\nevery fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody\nat all.\n\nThey made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was\nmore favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced\nto her a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was\nTilney. He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall,\nhad a pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if\nnot quite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and\nCatherine felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for\nspeaking while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found\nhim as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He\ntalked with fluency and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantry\nin his manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her.\nAfter chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the\nobjects around them, he suddenly addressed her with \"I have hitherto\nbeen very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I\nhave not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were\never here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the\ntheatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have\nbeen very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these\nparticulars? If you are I will begin directly.\"\n\n\"You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.\"\n\n\"No trouble, I assure you, madam.\" Then forming his features into a set\nsmile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simpering\nair, \"Have you been long in Bath, madam?\"\n\n\"About a week, sir,\" replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.\n\n\"Really!\" with affected astonishment.\n\n\"Why should you be surprised, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed!\" said he, in his natural tone. \"But some emotion must\nappear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed,\nand not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you\nnever here before, madam?\"\n\n\"Never, sir.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.\"\n\n\"Have you been to the theatre?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"To the concert?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?\"\n\n\"Yes I like it very well.\"\n\n\"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.\"\nCatherine turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture\nto laugh. \"I see what you think of me,\" said he gravely \"I shall make\nbut a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.\"\n\n\"My journal!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower\nRooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black\nshoes appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a\nqueer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and\ndistressed me by his nonsense.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall say no such thing.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you what you ought to say?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had\na great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary\ngenius hope I may know more of him. _That_, madam, is what I _wish_ you\nto say.\"\n\n\"But, perhaps, I keep no journal.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by you.\nThese are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a\njournal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your\nlife in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of\nevery day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every\nevening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered,\nand the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to\nbe described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse\nto a journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies  ways\nas you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling\nwhich largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which\nladies are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of\nwriting agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done\nsomething, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the\npractice of keeping a journal.\"\n\n\"I have sometimes thought,\" said Catherine, doubtingly, \"whether ladies\ndo write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is I should not\nthink the superiority was always on our side.\"\n\n\"As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the\nusual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three\nparticulars.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\"\n\n\"A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a\nvery frequent ignorance of grammar.\"\n\n\"Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the\ncompliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.\"\n\n\"I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better\nletters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better\nlandscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation,\nexcellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: \"My dear Catherine,\" said she, \"do\ntake this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already;\nI shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though\nit cost but nine shillings a yard.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,\" said Mr.\nTilney, looking at the muslin.\n\n\"Do you understand muslins, sir?\"\n\n\"Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be\nan excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of\na gown. I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be\na prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five\nshillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.\"\n\nMrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius. \"Men commonly take so little\nnotice of those things,\" said she; \"I can never get Mr. Allen to know\none of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your\nsister, sir.\"\n\n\"I hope I am, madam.\"\n\n\"And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland s gown?\"\n\n\"It is very pretty, madam,\" said he, gravely examining it; \"but I do\nnot think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.\"\n\n\"How can you,\" said Catherine, laughing, \"be so \" She had almost said\n\"strange.\"\n\n\"I am quite of your opinion, sir,\" replied Mrs. Allen; \"and so I told\nMiss Morland when she bought it.\"\n\n\"But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or\nother; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a\ncap, or a cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my\nsister say so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more\nthan she wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.\"\n\n\"Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We\nare sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in\nSalisbury, but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen\nsays it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than\neight; and it is such a fag I come back tired to death. Now, here one\ncan step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.\"\n\nMr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said; and\nshe kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced.\nCatherine feared, as she listened to their discourse, that he indulged\nhimself a little too much with the foibles of others. \"What are you\nthinking of so earnestly?\" said he, as they walked back to the\nballroom; \"not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head,\nyour meditations are not satisfactory.\"\n\nCatherine coloured, and said, \"I was not thinking of anything.\"\n\n\"That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once\nthat you will not tell me.\"\n\n\"Well then, I will not.\"\n\n\"Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to\ntease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world\nadvances intimacy so much.\"\n\nThey danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the lady s\nside at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the\nacquaintance. Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank her\nwarm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him\nwhen there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a\nslight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a\ncelebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified\nin falling in love before the gentleman s love is declared,[1] it must\nbe very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before\nthe gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her. How proper Mr.\nTilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr.\nAllen s head, but that he was not objectionable as a common\nacquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he\nhad early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was, and\nhad been assured of Mr. Tilney s being a clergyman, and of a very\nrespectable family in Gloucestershire.\n\n [1] Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson, No. 97, Vol. ii, Rambler.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 4\n\n\nWith more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room\nthe next day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before\nthe morning were over, and ready to meet him with a smile; but no smile\nwas demanded Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath, except\nhimself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of the\nfashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and\nout, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody\nwanted to see; and he only was absent. \"What a delightful place Bath\nis,\" said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after\nparading the room till they were tired; \"and how pleasant it would be\nif we had any acquaintance here.\"\n\nThis sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no\nparticular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now;\nbut we are told to \"despair of nothing we would attain,\" as \"unwearied\ndiligence our point would gain\"; and the unwearied diligence with which\nshe had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its\njust reward, for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady\nof about her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at\nher attentively for several minutes, addressed her with great\ncomplaisance in these words: \"I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it\nis a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your\nname Allen?\" This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger\npronounced hers to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the\nfeatures of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only\nonce since their respective marriages, and that many years ago. Their\njoy on this meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had\nbeen contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen\nyears. Compliments on good looks now passed; and, after observing how\ntime had slipped away since they were last together, how little they\nhad thought of meeting in Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an\nold friend, they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as\nto their families, sisters, and cousins, talking both together, far\nmore ready to give than to receive information, and each hearing very\nlittle of what the other said. Mrs. Thorpe, however, had one great\nadvantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of children; and\nwhen she expatiated on the talents of her sons, and the beauty of her\ndaughters, when she related their different situations and views that\nJohn was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors , and William at sea and\nall of them more beloved and respected in their different station than\nany other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar information\nto give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving\near of her friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all\nthese maternal effusions, consoling herself, however, with the\ndiscovery, which her keen eye soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe s\npelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own.\n\n\"Here come my dear girls,\" cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three\nsmart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her.\n\"My dear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so\ndelighted to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a\nfine young woman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe\nIsabella is the handsomest.\"\n\nThe Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a\nshort time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to\nstrike them all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the\neldest young lady observed aloud to the rest, \"How excessively like her\nbrother Miss Morland is!\"\n\n\"The very picture of him indeed!\" cried the mother and \"I should have\nknown her anywhere for his sister!\" was repeated by them all, two or\nthree times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe\nand her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance\nwith Mr. James Morland, before she remembered that her eldest brother\nhad lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, of\nthe name of Thorpe; and that he had spent the last week of the\nChristmas vacation with his family, near London.\n\nThe whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss\nThorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of being\nconsidered as already friends, through the friendship of their\nbrothers, etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with\nall the pretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof\nof amity, she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss\nThorpe, and take a turn with her about the room. Catherine was\ndelighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost\nforgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is\ncertainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\n\nTheir conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free\ndiscussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy\nbetween two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and\nquizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss\nMorland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided\nadvantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of\nBath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London;\ncould rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of\ntasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and\nlady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the\nthickness of a crowd. These powers received due admiration from\nCatherine, to whom they were entirely new; and the respect which they\nnaturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not\nthe easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe s manners, and her frequent expressions\nof delight on this acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling\nof awe, and left nothing but tender affection. Their increasing\nattachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the\npump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss\nThorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen s\nhouse; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and\nlengthened shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that\nthey should see each other across the theatre at night, and say their\nprayers in the same chapel the next morning. Catherine then ran\ndirectly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe s progress down the street\nfrom the drawing-room window; admired the graceful spirit of her walk,\nthe fashionable air of her figure and dress; and felt grateful, as well\nshe might, for the chance which had procured her such a friend.\n\nMrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was a\ngood-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Her\neldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by\npretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her air, and\ndressing in the same style, did very well.\n\nThis brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity\nof a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past\nadventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy\nthe three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of\nlords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had\npassed twenty years before, be minutely repeated.\n\n\n\n\n",

Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She\nhoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine\nweather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a\ndoubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its\ninhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk\nabout and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.\n\nAs soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly\njoined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to\ndiscover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not a\ngenteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday\nthroughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe\nthe fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in\narm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved\nconversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was\nCatherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was\nnowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful,\nin morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor\nLower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor\namong the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the\nmorning. His name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do\nno more. He must be gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his\nstay would be so short! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so\nbecoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine s imagination\naround his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more\nof him. From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been\nonly two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a\nsubject, however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend,\nfrom whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to\nthink of him; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered\ntherefore to weaken. Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming\nyoung man, and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with\nher dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return. She liked him\nthe better for being a clergyman, \"for she must confess herself very\npartial to the profession\"; and something like a sigh escaped her as\nshe said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of\nthat gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the finesse\nof love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery\nwas properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced.\n\nMrs. Allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with Bath. She had found\nsome acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family\nof a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune,\nhad found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself.\nHer daily expressions were no longer, \"I wish we had some acquaintance\nin Bath!\" They were changed into, \"How glad I am we have met with Mrs.\nThorpe!\" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two\nfamilies, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never\nsatisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of\nMrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was\nscarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of\nsubject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen\nof her gowns.\n\nThe progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick\nas its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through\nevery gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no\nfresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves. They\ncalled each other by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when\nthey walked, pinned up each other s train for the dance, and were not\nto be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other\nenjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and\ndirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for\nI will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with\nnovel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very\nperformances, to the number of which they are themselves adding joining\nwith their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such\nworks, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own\nheroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over\nits insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be\nnot patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect\nprotection and regard? I cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the\nreviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over\nevery new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which\nthe press now groans. Let us not desert one another; we are an injured\nbody. Although our productions have afforded more extensive and\nunaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the\nworld, no species of composition has been so much decried. From pride,\nignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers. And\nwhile the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of\nEngland, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some\ndozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the\nSpectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand\npens there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and\nundervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the\nperformances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them.\n\"I am no novel-reader I seldom look into novels Do not imagine that _I_\noften read novels It is really very well for a novel.\" Such is the\ncommon cant. \"And what are you reading, Miss ?\" \"Oh! It is only a\nnovel!\" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with\naffected indifference, or momentary shame. \"It is only Cecilia, or\nCamilla, or Belinda\"; or, in short, only some work in which the\ngreatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough\nknowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties,\nthe liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in\nthe best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged\nwith a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly\nwould she have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances\nmust be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous\npublication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a\nyoung person of taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting\nin the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and\ntopics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their\nlanguage, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea\nof the age that could endure it.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 6\n\n\nThe following conversation, which took place between the two friends in\nthe pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or nine days,\nis given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of the\ndelicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste which\nmarked the reasonableness of that attachment.\n\nThey met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five\nminutes before her friend, her first address naturally was, \"My dearest\ncreature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you\nat least this age!\"\n\n\"Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was\nin very good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here\nlong?\"\n\n\"Oh! These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half\nhour. But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and\nenjoy ourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first\nplace, I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to\nset off; it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into\nagonies! Do you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a\nshop window in Milsom Street just now very like yours, only with\ncoquelicot ribbons instead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my\ndearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all this\nmorning? Have you gone on with Udolpho?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the\nblack veil.\"\n\n\"Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is\nbehind the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me I would not be told\nupon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is\nLaurentina s skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like\nto spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not been\nto meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.\"\n\n\"Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have\nfinished Udolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made\nout a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.\"\n\n\"Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?\"\n\n\"I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook.\nCastle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the\nBlack Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries.\nThose will last us some time.\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all\nhorrid?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a\nsweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read every\none of them. I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with\nher. She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive. I\nthink her as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for\nnot admiring her! I scold them all amazingly about it.\"\n\n\"Scold them! Do you scold them for not admiring her?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for those who are\nreally my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is\nnot my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong. I told\nCaptain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to\ntease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he would allow\nMiss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us incapable\nof real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the\ndifference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I\nshould fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for _you_\nare just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Catherine, colouring. \"How can you say so?\"\n\n\"I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactly\nwhat Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something\namazingly insipid about her. Oh! I must tell you, that just after we\nparted yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly I am\nsure he is in love with you.\" Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again.\nIsabella laughed. \"It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it\nis; you are indifferent to everybody s admiration, except that of one\ngentleman, who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you\" speaking\nmore seriously \"your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart is\nreally attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with\nthe attention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so\nuninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved object! I can\nperfectly comprehend your feelings.\"\n\n\"But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr.\nTilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.\"\n\n\"Not see him again! My dearest creature, do not talk of it. I am sure\nyou would be miserable if you thought so!\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very\nmuch pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if\nnobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dear\nIsabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina s skeleton behind it.\"\n\n\"It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before;\nbut I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.\"\n\n\"No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself;\nbut new books do not fall in our way.\"\n\n\"Sir Charles Grandison! That is an amazing horrid book, is it not? I\nremember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.\"\n\n\"It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is very\nentertaining.\"\n\n\"Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable.\nBut, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your head\ntonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you.\nThe men take notice of _that_ sometimes, you know.\"\n\n\"But it does not signify if they do,\" said Catherine, very innocently.\n\n\"Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say.\nThey are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with\nspirit, and make them keep their distance.\"\n\n\"Are they? Well, I never observed _that_. They always behave very well\nto me.\"\n\n\"Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited\ncreatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance! By\nthe by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always\nforgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do you\nlike them best dark or fair?\"\n\n\"I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both,\nI think. Brown not fair, and and not very dark.\"\n\n\"Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not forgot your\ndescription of Mr. Tilney  a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather\ndark hair.  Well, my taste is different. I prefer light eyes, and as to\ncomplexion do you know I like a sallow better than any other. You must\nnot betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance\nanswering that description.\"\n\n\"Betray you! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us drop\nthe subject.\"\n\nCatherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a few\nmoments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested her at\nthat time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina s\nskeleton, when her friend prevented her, by saying, \"For heaven s sake!\nLet us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are two\nodious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They\nreally put me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the\narrivals. They will hardly follow us there.\"\n\nAway they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the names, it\nwas Catherine s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming\nyoung men.\n\n\"They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not so\nimpertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I am\ndetermined I will not look up.\"\n\nIn a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured her that\nshe need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left the\npump-room.\n\n\"And which way are they gone?\" said Isabella, turning hastily round.\n\"One was a very good-looking young man.\"\n\n\"They went towards the church-yard.\"\n\n\"Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say\nyou to going to Edgar s Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat?\nYou said you should like to see it.\"\n\nCatherine readily agreed. \"Only,\" she added, \"perhaps we may overtake\nthe two young men.\"\n\n\"Oh! Never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them\npresently, and I am dying to show you my hat.\"\n\n\"But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of our\nseeing them at all.\"\n\n\"I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have no\nnotion of treating men with such respect. _That_ is the way to spoil\nthem.\"\n\nCatherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and therefore,\nto show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her resolution of humbling\nthe sex, they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in\npursuit of the two young men.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 7\n\n\nHalf a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway,\nopposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped. Everybody\nacquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap\nStreet at this point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature,\nso unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and\nthe principal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties\nof ladies, however important their business, whether in quest of\npastry, millinery, or even (as in the present case) of young men, are\nnot detained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts.\nThis evil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by\nIsabella since her residence in Bath; and she was now fated to feel and\nlament it once more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union\nPassage, and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding\nthrough the crowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting\nalley, they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven\nalong on bad pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the\nvehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his\ncompanion, and his horse.\n\n\"Oh, these odious gigs!\" said Isabella, looking up. \"How I detest\nthem.\" But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for\nshe looked again and exclaimed, \"Delightful! Mr. Morland and my\nbrother!\"\n\n\"Good heaven!  Tis James!\" was uttered at the same moment by Catherine;\nand, on catching the young men s eyes, the horse was immediately\nchecked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the\nservant having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the\nequipage was delivered to his care.\n\nCatherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her\nbrother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very amiable\ndisposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every proof on his\nside of equal satisfaction, which he could have leisure to do, while\nthe bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice;\nand to her his devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and\nembarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she been more\nexpert in the development of other people s feelings, and less simply\nengrossed by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite as\npretty as she could do herself.\n\nJohn Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the\nhorses, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the amends\nwhich were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the\nhand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short\nbow. He was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain\nface and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless\nhe wore the dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he\nwere easy where he ought to be civil, and impudent where he might be\nallowed to be easy. He took out his watch: \"How long do you think we\nhave been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?\"\n\n\"I do not know the distance.\" Her brother told her that it was\ntwenty-three miles.\n\n\"_Three_-and-twenty!\" cried Thorpe, \"five-and-twenty if it is an inch.\"\nMorland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers,\nand milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer\ntest of distance. \"I know it must be five-and-twenty,\" said he, \"by the\ntime we have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of\nthe inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any\nman in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in\nharness; that makes it exactly twenty-five.\"\n\n\"You have lost an hour,\" said Morland; \"it was only ten o clock when we\ncame from Tetbury.\"\n\n\"Ten o clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This\nbrother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do\nbut look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in\nyour life?\" (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving\noff.) \"Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only\nthree and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible\nif you can.\"\n\n\"He _does_ look very hot, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Hot! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look\nat his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse\n_cannot_ go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get\non. What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it?\nWell hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a\nChristchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran\nit a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with\nit. I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the\nkind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I\nchanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford,\nlast term:  Ah! Thorpe,  said he,  do you happen to want such a little\nthing as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired\nof it.   Oh! D ,  said I;  I am your man; what do you ask?  And how\nmuch do you think he did, Miss Morland?\"\n\n\"I am sure I cannot guess at all.\"\n\n\"Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,\nlamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as\nnew, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly,\nthrew down the money, and the carriage was mine.\"\n\n\"And I am sure,\" said Catherine, \"I know so little of such things that\nI cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.\"\n\n\"Neither one nor t other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but\nI hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.\"\n\n\"That was very good-natured of you,\" said Catherine, quite pleased.\n\n\"Oh! D   it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend,\nI hate to be pitiful.\"\n\nAn inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young\nladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that\nthe gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar s Buildings, and pay their\nrespects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and so well\nsatisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was she\nendeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double\nrecommendation of being her brother s friend, and her friend s brother,\nso pure and uncoquettish were her feelings, that, though they overtook\nand passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so far\nfrom seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them only\nthree times.\n\nJohn Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes \nsilence, renewed the conversation about his gig. \"You will find,\nhowever, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some\npeople, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day;\nJackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morland, who overheard this; \"but you forget that your\nhorse was included.\"\n\n\"My horse! Oh, d   it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are you\nfond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?\"\n\n\"Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am\nparticularly fond of it.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the\npropriety of accepting such an offer.\n\n\"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?\"\n\n\"Rest! He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense;\nnothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon.\nNo, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day\nwhile I am here.\"\n\n\"Shall you indeed!\" said Catherine very seriously. \"That will be forty\nmiles a day.\"\n\n\"Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown\ntomorrow; mind, I am engaged.\"\n\n\"How delightful that will be!\" cried Isabella, turning round. \"My\ndearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will\nnot have room for a third.\"\n\n\"A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters\nabout; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of\nyou.\"\n\nThis brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but\nCatherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her companion s\ndiscourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more\nthan a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of\nevery woman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as\nlong as she could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful\nfemale mind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition\nto that of a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own\nsex is concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question\nwhich had been long uppermost in her thoughts; it was, \"Have you ever\nread Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?\"\n\n\"Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else\nto do.\"\n\nCatherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her\nquestion, but he prevented her by saying, \"Novels are all so full of\nnonsense and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out\nsince Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t other day; but as for\nall the others, they are the stupidest things in creation.\"\n\n\"I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe s; her\nnovels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature\nin _them_.\"\n\n\"Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,\" said Catherine, with some\nhesitation, from the fear of mortifying him.\n\n\"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that\nother stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about,\nshe who married the French emigrant.\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean Camilla?\"\n\n\"Yes, that s the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at\nsee-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon\nfound it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be\nbefore I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was\nsure I should never be able to get through it.\"\n\n\"I have never read it.\"\n\n\"You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can\nimagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing\nat see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.\"\n\nThis critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor\nCatherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe s lodgings, and the\nfeelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way\nto the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs.\nThorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. \"Ah, Mother!\nHow do you do?\" said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand. \"Where\ndid you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch.\nHere is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must\nlook out for a couple of good beds somewhere near.\" And this address\nseemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother s heart, for she\nreceived him with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his two\nyounger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal\ntenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed that\nthey both looked very ugly.\n\nThese manners did not please Catherine; but he was James s friend and\nIsabella s brother; and her judgment was further bought off by\nIsabella s assuring her, when they withdrew to see the new hat, that\nJohn thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John s\nengaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening. Had she\nbeen older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where\nyouth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of\nreason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl\nin the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the\nconsequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with\nthe Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen s, and James, as the\ndoor was closed on them, said, \"Well, Catherine, how do you like my\nfriend Thorpe?\" instead of answering, as she probably would have done,\nhad there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, \"I do not\nlike him at all,\" she directly replied, \"I like him very much; he seems\nvery agreeable.\"\n\n\"He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle;\nbut that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like\nthe rest of the family?\"\n\n\"Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman\nI could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is\nso thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her;\nand she seems very fond of you. She said the highest things in your\npraise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss\nThorpe even you, Catherine,\" taking her hand with affection, \"may be\nproud of.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am,\" she replied; \"I love her exceedingly, and am delighted\nto find that you like her too. You hardly mentioned anything of her\nwhen you wrote to me after your visit there.\"\n\n\"Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a\ngreat deal together while you are in Bath. She is a most amiable girl;\nsuch a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her; she\nis evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in\nsuch a place as this is not she?\"\n\n\"Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest\ngirl in Bath.\"\n\n\"I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of\nbeauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here,\nmy dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe,\nit would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am\nsure, are very kind to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it\nwill be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far\non purpose to see _me_.\"\n\nJames accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience\nfor accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, \"Indeed,\nCatherine, I love you dearly.\"\n\nInquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the\nsituation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now\npassed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on\nJames s part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney\nStreet, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs.\nAllen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the\nlatter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and\ntippet. A pre-engagement in Edgar s Buildings prevented his accepting\nthe invitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as\nhe had satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties\nuniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was\nthen left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened\nimagination over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns\nof dressing and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen s fears on the\ndelay of an expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to\nbestow even on the reflection of her own felicity, in being already\nengaged for the evening.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 8\n\n\nIn spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from\nPulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time. The Thorpes\nand James Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella\nhaving gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the\nmost smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown,\nand envying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperones, arm\nin arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought\noccurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the\nhand or a smile of affection.\n\nThe dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and\nJames, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very\nimportunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the\ncard-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should\ninduce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too.\n\"I assure you,\" said she, \"I would not stand up without your dear\nsister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated\nthe whole evening.\" Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude,\nand they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when\nIsabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her,\nturned again to his sister and whispered, \"My dear creature, I am\nafraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to\nbegin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will\nbe back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out.\" Catherine,\nthough a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any\nopposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press\nher friend s hand and say, \"Good-bye, my dear love,\" before they\nhurried off. The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was\nleft to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now\nremained. She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr.\nThorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware\nthat, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was\nsharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all\nthe discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of the\nworld, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity,\nher actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true\nsource of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which\npeculiarly belong to the heroine s life, and her fortitude under it\nwhat particularly dignifies her character. Catherine had fortitude too;\nshe suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.\n\nFrom this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten\nminutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr.\nTilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be\nmoving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and\nthe blush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed\naway without sullying her heroic importance. He looked as handsome and\nas lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and\npleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine\nimmediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a\nfair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being\nmarried already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it\nhad never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not\nbehaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been\nused; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.\nFrom these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister s\nnow being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike\npaleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen s bosom, Catherine sat\nerect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little\nredder than usual.\n\nMr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to\napproach, were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs.\nThorpe; and this lady stopping to speak to her, they, as belonging to\nher, stopped likewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney s eye,\ninstantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition. She\nreturned it with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke\nboth to her and Mrs. Allen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged.\n\"I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had\nleft Bath.\" He thanked her for her fears, and said that he had quitted\nit for a week, on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of\nseeing her.\n\n\"Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it\nis just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too. I\ntell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he\nshould not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is\nmuch better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell\nhim he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health.\"\n\n\"And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place,\nfrom finding it of service to him.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he will. A neighbour of ours, Dr.\nSkinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quite\nstout.\"\n\n\"That circumstance must give great encouragement.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so I\ntell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away.\"\n\nHere they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen,\nthat she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney\nwith seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was\naccordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and\nafter a few minutes  consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with\nhim. This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe\nmortification to the lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her\nsorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it, that had\nThorpe, who joined her just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he\nmight have thought her sufferings rather too acute. The very easy\nmanner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not\nby any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the particulars\nwhich he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and\ndogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of\nterriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking\nvery often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney.\nOf her dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that\ngentleman, she could see nothing. They were in different sets. She was\nseparated from all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; one\nmortification succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this\nuseful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not\nnecessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady.\nFrom such a moralizing strain as this, she was suddenly roused by a\ntouch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes\ndirectly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman. \"I beg\nyour pardon, Miss Morland,\" said she, \"for this liberty but I cannot\nanyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would\nnot have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you.\"\nMrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more\nhappy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies were introduced to\neach other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness,\nMiss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of\nthe obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably\nsettled her young charge, returned to her party.\n\nMiss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable\ncountenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension,\nthe resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe s, had more real elegance. Her\nmanners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor\naffectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and\nat a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her,\nand without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable\nvexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at\nonce by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous\nof being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she\ncould think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying\nit. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by\nthe frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their\ndoing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance,\nby informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she\nadmired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or\nplayed, or sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback.\n\nThe two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm\ngently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,\n\"At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for\nyou this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you\nknew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you.\"\n\n\"My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could\nnot even see where you were.\"\n\n\"So I told your brother all the time but he would not believe me. Do go\nand see for her, Mr. Morland, said I but all in vain he would not stir\nan inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so\nimmoderately lazy! I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear\nCatherine, you would be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon\nceremony with such people.\"\n\n\"Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head,\"\nwhispered Catherine, detaching her friend from James. \"It is Mr.\nTilney s sister.\"\n\n\"Oh! Heavens! You don t say so! Let me look at her this moment. What a\ndelightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is\nher all-conquering brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me this\ninstant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr. Morland, you are not to\nlisten. We are not talking about you.\"\n\n\"But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?\"\n\n\"There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless\ncuriosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed!  Tis nothing. But be\nsatisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.\"\n\n\"And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?\"\n\n\"Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to\nyou, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you;\ntherefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear\nsomething not very agreeable.\"\n\nIn this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original\nsubject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well\npleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a little\nsuspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella s impatient desire to\nsee Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would\nhave led his fair partner away, but she resisted. \"I tell you, Mr.\nMorland,\" she cried, \"I would not do such a thing for all the world.\nHow can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your\nbrother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, though I\ntell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the\nrules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change\npartners.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour,\" said James, \"in these public assemblies, it is as\noften done as not.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry,\nyou never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me;\npersuade your brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would\nquite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?\"\n\n\"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better\nchange.\"\n\n\"There,\" cried Isabella, \"you hear what your sister says, and yet you\nwill not mind her. Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set\nall the old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest\nCatherine, for heaven s sake, and stand by me.\" And off they went, to\nregain their former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked\naway; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of\nrepeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once,\nmade her way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the\nhope of finding him still with them a hope which, when it proved to be\nfruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable. \"Well, my dear,\"\nsaid Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son, \"I hope you have had\nan agreeable partner.\"\n\n\"Very agreeable, madam.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he?\"\n\n\"Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?\" said Mrs. Allen.\n\n\"No, where is he?\"\n\n\"He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about,\nthat he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would ask\nyou, if he met with you.\"\n\n\"Where can he be?\" said Catherine, looking round; but she had not\nlooked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance.\n\n\"Ah! He has got a partner; I wish he had asked _you_,\" said Mrs. Allen;\nand after a short silence, she added, \"he is a very agreeable young\nman.\"\n\n\"Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen,\" said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; \"I\nmust say it, though I _am_ his mother, that there is not a more\nagreeable young man in the world.\"\n\nThis inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension\nof many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment s\nconsideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine, \"I dare say she\nthought I was speaking of her son.\"\n\nCatherine was disappointed and vexed. She seemed to have missed by so\nlittle the very object she had had in view; and this persuasion did not\nincline her to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her\nsoon afterwards and said, \"Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are\nto stand up and jig it together again.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and,\nbesides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.\"\n\n\"Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with\nme, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two\nyounger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this\nhalf hour.\"\n\nAgain Catherine excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz his\nsisters by himself. The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr.\nTilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his\npartner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, and\nJames and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the\nlatter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one\nsqueeze, and one \"dearest Catherine.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 9\n\n\nThe progress of Catherine s unhappiness from the events of the evening\nwas as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with\neverybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily\nbrought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home.\nThis, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of\nextraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an\nearnest longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of her\ndistress; for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which\nlasted nine hours, and from which she awoke perfectly revived, in\nexcellent spirits, with fresh hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish\nof her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and\nalmost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the\npump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one so newly arrived in Bath must\nbe met with, and that building she had already found so favourable for\nthe discovery of female excellence, and the completion of female\nintimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited\nconfidence, that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another\nfriend from within its walls. Her plan for the morning thus settled,\nshe sat quietly down to her book after breakfast, resolving to remain\nin the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one;\nand from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and\nejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for\nthinking were such, that as she never talked a great deal, so she could\nnever be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she sat at her work, if\nshe lost her needle or broke her thread, if she heard a carriage in the\nstreet, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must observe it aloud,\nwhether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not. At about\nhalf past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the\nwindow, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being\ntwo open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, her\nbrother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came\nrunning upstairs, calling out, \"Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have you\nbeen waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a\ncoachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,\nand now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out\nof the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was\nnot it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a\nconfounded hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Catherine. \"Where are you all going to?\"\n\n\"Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree\ntogether to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We are\ngoing up Claverton Down.\"\n\n\"Something was said about it, I remember,\" said Catherine, looking at\nMrs. Allen for her opinion; \"but really I did not expect you.\"\n\n\"Not expect me! That s a good one! And what a dust you would have made,\nif I had not come.\"\n\nCatherine s silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown\naway, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any\nexpression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended\nby anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney\nagain could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and\nwho thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe,\nas Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore\nobliged to speak plainer. \"Well, ma am, what do you say to it? Can you\nspare me for an hour or two? Shall I go?\"\n\n\"Do just as you please, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Allen, with the most\nplacid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get\nready. In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowed\nthe two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her\npraise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen s admiration of his gig;\nand then receiving her friend s parting good wishes, they both hurried\ndownstairs. \"My dearest creature,\" cried Isabella, to whom the duty of\nfriendship immediately called her before she could get into the\ncarriage, \"you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was\nafraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have a\nthousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to\nbe off.\"\n\nCatherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear\nher friend exclaim aloud to James, \"What a sweet girl she is! I quite\ndote on her.\"\n\n\"You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,\" said Thorpe, as he handed\nher in, \"if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.\nHe will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest\nfor a minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits,\nplayful as can be, but there is no vice in him.\"\n\nCatherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was\ntoo late to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened;\nso, resigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal s boasted\nknowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down\nby her. Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the\nhorse s head was bid in an important voice \"to let him go,\" and off\nthey went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a\ncaper, or anything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an\nescape, spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her\ncompanion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her\nthat it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which\nhe had then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity\nwith which he had directed his whip. Catherine, though she could not\nhelp wondering that with such perfect command of his horse, he should\nthink it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks,\ncongratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent\na coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the\nsame quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any\nunpleasant vivacity, and (considering its inevitable pace was ten miles\nan hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the\nenjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine\nmild day of February, with the consciousness of safety. A silence of\nseveral minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by\nThorpe s saying very abruptly, \"Old Allen is as rich as a Jew is not\nhe?\" Catherine did not understand him and he repeated his question,\nadding in explanation, \"Old Allen, the man you are with.\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very rich.\"\n\n\"And no children at all?\"\n\n\"No not any.\"\n\n\"A famous thing for his next heirs. He is _your_ godfather, is not he?\"\n\n\"My godfather! No.\"\n\n\"But you are always very much with them.\"\n\n\"Yes, very much.\"\n\n\"Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of old fellow enough,\nand has lived very well in his time, I dare say; he is not gouty for\nnothing. Does he drink his bottle a day now?\"\n\n\"His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is a\nvery temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?\"\n\n\"Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men s being in liquor.\nWhy, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of\n_this_ that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would\nnot be half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a\nfamous good thing for us all.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it.\"\n\n\"Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not the\nhundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to\nbe. Our foggy climate wants help.\"\n\n\"And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in\nOxford.\"\n\n\"Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody\ndrinks there. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four\npints at the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable\nthing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared\nabout five pints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the\ncommon way. _Mine_ is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not\noften meet with anything like it in Oxford and that may account for it.\nBut this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking\nthere.\"\n\n\"Yes, it does give a notion,\" said Catherine warmly, \"and that is, that\nyou all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, I\nam sure James does not drink so much.\"\n\nThis declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which no\npart was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting\nalmost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when it\nended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of\nwine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her brother s\ncomparative sobriety.\n\nThorpe s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, and\nshe was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse\nmoved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence of\nthe springs, gave the motion of the carriage. She followed him in all\nhis admiration as well as she could. To go before or beyond him was\nimpossible. His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject, his\nrapidity of expression, and her diffidence of herself put that out of\nher power; she could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she\nreadily echoed whatever he chose to assert, and it was finally settled\nbetween them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether\nthe most complete of its kind in England, his carriage the neatest, his\nhorse the best goer, and himself the best coachman. \"You do not really\nthink, Mr. Thorpe,\" said Catherine, venturing after some time to\nconsider the matter as entirely decided, and to offer some little\nvariation on the subject, \"that James s gig will break down?\"\n\n\"Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in\nyour life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels have\nbeen fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body! Upon\nmy soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the\nmost devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we have\ngot a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty\nthousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Catherine, quite frightened. \"Then pray let us\nturn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do\nlet us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell\nhim how very unsafe it is.\"\n\n\"Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll if\nit does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent\nfalling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how\nto drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty\nyears after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake\nfor five pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a\nnail.\"\n\nCatherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two\nsuch very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been\nbrought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to\nhow many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity\nwill lead. Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom\naimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contented\nwith a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit\ntherefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting\nat one moment what they would contradict the next. She reflected on the\naffair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the\npoint of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real\nopinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared to\nher that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making\nthose things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining to\nthis, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and\nhis friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily\npreserve them, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to\nbe in fact perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer.\nBy him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of\nhis conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his\nown concerns. He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle\nand sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment\nhad infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he\nhad killed more birds (though without having one good shot) than all\nhis companions together; and described to her some famous day s sport,\nwith the fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the\ndogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in\nwhich the boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his\nown life for a moment, had been constantly leading others into\ndifficulties, which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many.\n\nLittle as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and\nunfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could\nnot entirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of his\nendless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable. It was a\nbold surmise, for he was Isabella s brother; and she had been assured\nby James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in\nspite of this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over\nher before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly\nto increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, in\nsome small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his\npowers of giving universal pleasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at Mrs. Allen s door, the astonishment of Isabella\nwas hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day\nfor them to attend her friend into the house: \"Past three o clock!\" It\nwas inconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither\nbelieve her own watch, nor her brother s, nor the servant s; she would\nbelieve no assurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland\nproduced his watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment\nlonger _then_, would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and\nimpossible; and she could only protest, over and over again, that no\ntwo hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine\nwas called on to confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to\nplease Isabella; but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s\ndissenting voice, by not waiting for her answer. Her own feelings\nentirely engrossed her; her wretchedness was most acute on finding\nherself obliged to go directly home. It was ages since she had had a\nmoment s conversation with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had\nsuch thousands of things to say to her, it appeared as if they were\nnever to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery,\nand the laughing eye of utter despondency, she bade her friend adieu\nand went on.\n\nCatherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of\nthe morning, and was immediately greeted with, \"Well, my dear, here you\nare,\" a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to\ndispute; \"and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.\"\n\n\"So Mrs. Thorpe said; she was vastly pleased at your all going.\"\n\n\"You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met\nher, and we had a great deal of talk together. She says there was\nhardly any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly\nscarce.\"\n\n\"Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?\"\n\n\"Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs.\nHughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.\"\n\n\"Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seem\nvery agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin,\nand I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses very\nhandsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.\"\n\n\"And what did she tell you of them?\"\n\n\"Oh! A vast deal indeed; she hardly talked of anything else.\"\n\n\"Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?\"\n\n\"Yes, she did; but I cannot recollect now. But they are very good kind\nof people, and very rich. Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she and\nMrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large\nfortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousand\npounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw all\nthe clothes after they came from the warehouse.\"\n\n\"And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain. Upon recollection,\nhowever, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is;\nyes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there\nwas a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter\non her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put\nby for her when her mother died.\"\n\n\"And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?\"\n\n\"I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he\nis; but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and\nlikely to do very well.\"\n\nCatherine inquired no further; she had heard enough to feel that Mrs.\nAllen had no real intelligence to give, and that she was most\nparticularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with\nboth brother and sister. Could she have foreseen such a circumstance,\nnothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others; and, as it\nwas, she could only lament her ill luck, and think over what she had\nlost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very\npleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 10\n\n\nThe Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at the\ntheatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then an\nopportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand\nthings which had been collecting within her for communication in the\nimmeasurable length of time which had divided them. \"Oh, heavens! My\nbeloved Catherine, have I got you at last?\" was her address on\nCatherine s entering the box and sitting by her. \"Now, Mr. Morland,\"\nfor he was close to her on the other side, \"I shall not speak another\nword to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect\nit. My sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need\nnot ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair\nin a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you\nwant to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love\nwith you already; and as for Mr. Tilney but _that_ is a settled\nthing even _your_ modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming\nback to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him!\nI really am quite wild with impatience. My mother says he is the most\ndelightful young man in the world; she saw him this morning, you know;\nyou must introduce him to me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for\nheaven s sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Catherine, \"he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him? How do you like my\ngown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own\nthought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother\nand I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be\nhere for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon\nfound out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country\nto every other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it\nwas quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we\ndiffered; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly\nthing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about\nit.\"\n\n\"No, indeed I should not.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself.\nYou would have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some\nnonsense of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond\nconception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not\nhave had you by for the world.\"\n\n\"Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark\nupon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my\nhead.\"\n\nIsabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to\nJames.\n\nCatherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again\ncontinued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of\ngoing to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a second\nprevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to\ndelay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,\nwhere the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr.\nAllen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to talk\nover the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their\nnewspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new\nface, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the\nThorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in\nless than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her\nusual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant\nattendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves\nfrom the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some time,\ntill Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,\nconfining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very little\nshare in the notice of either. They were always engaged in some\nsentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was\nconveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with so\nmuch laughter, that though Catherine s supporting opinion was not\nunfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give\nany, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however she\nwas empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed\nnecessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just\nentering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with\na firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had\ncourage to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the\nday before. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her\nadvances with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as\nlong as both parties remained in the room; and though in all\nprobability not an observation was made, nor an expression used by\neither which had not been made and used some thousands of times before,\nunder that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their being\nspoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might\nbe something uncommon.\n\n\"How well your brother dances!\" was an artless exclamation of\nCatherine s towards the close of their conversation, which at once\nsurprised and amused her companion.\n\n\"Henry!\" she replied with a smile. \"Yes, he does dance very well.\"\n\n\"He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the\nother evening, when he saw me sitting down. But I really had been\nengaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe.\" Miss Tilney could only bow. \"You\ncannot think,\" added Catherine after a moment s silence, \"how surprised\nI was to see him again. I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.\"\n\n\"When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but\nfor a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us.\"\n\n\"_That_ never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I\nthought he must be gone. Was not the young lady he danced with on\nMonday a Miss Smith?\"\n\n\"Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.\"\n\n\"I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think her pretty?\"\n\n\"Not very.\"\n\n\"He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father.\"\n\nMrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to\ngo. \"I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,\" said\nCatherine. \"Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we Yes, I think we certainly shall.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.\" This civility was duly\nreturned; and they parted on Miss Tilney s side with some knowledge of\nher new acquaintance s feelings, and on Catherine s, without the\nsmallest consciousness of having explained them.\n\nShe went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, and\nthe evening of the following day was now the object of expectation, the\nfuture good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the\noccasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dress\nis at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about\nit often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her\ngreat aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas\nbefore; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating\nbetween her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the\nshortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.\nThis would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,\nfrom which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather\nthan a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of\nthe insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to\nthe feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how\nlittle the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their\nattire; how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how\nunsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,\nthe mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction\nalone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the\nbetter for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a\nsomething of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the\nlatter. But not one of these grave reflections troubled the\ntranquillity of Catherine.\n\nShe entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different\nfrom what had attended her thither the Monday before. She had then been\nexulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to\navoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could\nnot, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to\ndance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every\nyoung lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every\nyoung lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have\nbeen, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from\nthe pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been\nanxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As\nsoon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine s agony began; she\nfidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as\npossible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear\nhim. The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she\nsaw nothing of the Tilneys.\n\n\"Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,\" whispered Isabella, \"but I\nam really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively\nit is quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but\nyou and John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature,\nand come to us. John is just walked off, but he will be back in a\nmoment.\"\n\nCatherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walked\naway, John Thorpe was still in view, and she gave herself up for lost.\nThat she might not appear, however, to observe or expect him, she kept\nher eyes intently fixed on her fan; and a self-condemnation for her\nfolly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with\nthe Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her mind,\nwhen she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance,\nby Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she\ngranted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went\nwith him to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as she\nbelieved, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so\nimmediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had\nsought her on purpose! it did not appear to her that life could supply\nany greater felicity.\n\nScarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a\nplace, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who\nstood behind her. \"Heyday, Miss Morland!\" said he. \"What is the meaning\nof this? I thought you and I were to dance together.\"\n\n\"I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.\"\n\n\"That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the\nroom, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round,\nyou were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake\nof dancing with _you_, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever\nsince Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in\nthe lobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my\nacquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the\nroom; and when they see you standing up with somebody else, they will\nquiz me famously.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; they will never think of _me_, after such a description as\nthat.\"\n\n\"By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for\nblockheads. What chap have you there?\" Catherine satisfied his\ncuriosity. \"Tilney,\" he repeated. \"Hum I do not know him. A good figure\nof a man; well put together. Does he want a horse? Here is a friend of\nmine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A\nfamous clever animal for the road only forty guineas. I had fifty minds\nto buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse\nwhen I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not\ndo for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I have\nthree now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take eight\nhundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in\nLeicestershire, against the next season. It is so d uncomfortable,\nliving at an inn.\"\n\nThis was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine s\nattention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of\na long string of passing ladies. Her partner now drew near, and said,\n\"That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with\nyou half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw the attention\nof my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual\nagreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness\nbelongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten\nthemselves on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the\nother. I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity\nand complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do\nnot choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the\npartners or wives of their neighbours.\"\n\n\"But they are such very different things!\"\n\n\" That you think they cannot be compared together.\"\n\n\"To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep\nhouse together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a\nlong room for half an hour.\"\n\n\"And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that\nlight certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could\nplace them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the\nadvantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it\nis an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of\neach; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each\nother till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each\nto endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had\nbestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their\nown imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their\nneighbours, or fancying that they should have been better off with\nanyone else. You will allow all this?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still\nthey are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the same\nlight, nor think the same duties belong to them.\"\n\n\"In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man\nis supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make\nthe home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile.\nBut in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness,\nthe compliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and\nthe lavender water. _That_, I suppose, was the difference of duties\nwhich struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I never thought of that.\"\n\n\"Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This\ndisposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any\nsimilarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your\nnotions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your\npartner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who\nspoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to\naddress you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing\nwith him as long as you chose?\"\n\n\"Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s, that if\nhe talks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three\nyoung men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with.\"\n\n\"And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!\"\n\n\"Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody,\nit is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not _want_\nto talk to anybody.\"\n\n\"Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed\nwith courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of\nmaking the inquiry before?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite more so, indeed.\"\n\n\"More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper\ntime. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.\"\n\n\"I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.\"\n\n\"Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds\nout every year.  For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but\nbeyond _that_, it is the most tiresome place in the world.  You would\nbe told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every\nwinter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at\nlast because they can afford to stay no longer.\"\n\n\"Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to\nLondon may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retired\nvillage in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place\nas this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a\nvariety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know\nnothing of there.\"\n\n\"You are not fond of the country.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But\ncertainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath\nlife. One day in the country is exactly like another.\"\n\n\"But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.\"\n\n\"Do I?\"\n\n\"Do you not?\"\n\n\"I do not believe there is much difference.\"\n\n\"Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.\"\n\n\"And so I am at home only I do not find so much of it. I walk about\nhere, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every\nstreet, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.\"\n\nMr. Tilney was very much amused.\n\n\"Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!\" he repeated. \"What a picture of\nintellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you\nwill have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all\nthat you did here.\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to\nMrs. Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking\nof Bath, when I am at home again I _do_ like it so very much. If I\ncould but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I\nshould be too happy! James s coming (my eldest brother) is quite\ndelightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are\njust got so intimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can\never be tired of Bath?\"\n\n\"Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do.\nBut papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good\ndeal gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath and the honest relish\nof balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.\" Here their\nconversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too\nimportunate for a divided attention.\n\nSoon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived\nherself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the\nlookers-on, immediately behind her partner. He was a very handsome man,\nof a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of\nlife; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him\npresently address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his\nnotice, and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something\nwrong in her appearance, she turned away her head. But while she did\nso, the gentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said, \"I\nsee that you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows\nyour name, and you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my\nfather.\"\n\nCatherine s answer was only \"Oh!\" but it was an \"Oh!\" expressing\neverything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance on\ntheir truth. With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now\nfollow the general, as he moved through the crowd, and \"How handsome a\nfamily they are!\" was her secret remark.\n\nIn chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source\nof felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk since her\narrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented\nenvirons were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all\neagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might\nfind nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister\nthat they should join in a walk, some morning or other. \"I shall like\nit,\" she cried, \"beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it\noff let us go tomorrow.\" This was readily agreed to, with only a\nproviso of Miss Tilney s, that it did not rain, which Catherine was\nsure it would not. At twelve o clock, they were to call for her in\nPulteney Street; and \"Remember twelve o clock,\" was her parting speech\nto her new friend. Of her other, her older, her more established\nfriend, Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a\nfortnight s experience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening.\nYet, though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness, she\ncheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather\nearly away, and her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her\nchair all the way home.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 11\n\n\nThe morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making only a\nfew efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from it everything most\nfavourable to her wishes. A bright morning so early in the year, she\nallowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold\nimprovement as the day advanced. She applied to Mr. Allen for\nconfirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and\nbarometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine.\nShe applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen s opinion was more positive.\n\"She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the\nclouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.\"\n\nAt about eleven o clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the\nwindows caught Catherine s watchful eye, and \"Oh! dear, I do believe it\nwill be wet,\" broke from her in a most desponding tone.\n\n\"I thought how it would be,\" said Mrs. Allen.\n\n\"No walk for me today,\" sighed Catherine; \"but perhaps it may come to\nnothing, or it may hold up before twelve.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.\"\n\n\"Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied her friend very placidly, \"I know you never mind dirt.\"\n\nAfter a short pause, \"It comes on faster and faster!\" said Catherine,\nas she stood watching at a window.\n\n\"So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.\"\n\n\"There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an\numbrella!\"\n\n\"They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a\nchair at any time.\"\n\n\"It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would be\ndry!\"\n\n\"Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in\nthe pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put\non his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had\nrather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder\nhe should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.\"\n\nThe rain continued fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five\nminutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept\non raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as\nhopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained. \"You will not\nbe able to go, my dear.\"\n\n\"I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter\nafter twelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do\nthink it looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after\ntwelve, and now I _shall_ give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such\nweather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the\nsouth of France! the night that poor St. Aubin died! such beautiful\nweather!\"\n\nAt half past twelve, when Catherine s anxious attention to the weather\nwas over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment,\nthe sky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite\nby surprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she\ninstantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy\nappearance. Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon\nwould succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had \"always\nthought it would clear up.\" But whether Catherine might still expect\nher friends, whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney\nto venture, must yet be a question.\n\nIt was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the\npump-room; he accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barely\nwatched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach\nof the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that\nhad surprised her so much a few mornings back.\n\n\"Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for\nme perhaps but I shall not go I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss\nTilney may still call.\" Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soon\nwith them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he\nwas calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. \"Make haste! Make haste!\"\nas he threw open the door. \"Put on your hat this moment there is no\ntime to be lost we are going to Bristol. How d ye do, Mrs. Allen?\"\n\n\"To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go\nwith you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every\nmoment.\" This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all;\nMrs. Allen was called on to second him, and the two others walked in,\nto give their assistance. \"My sweetest Catherine, is not this\ndelightful? We shall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your\nbrother and me for the scheme; it darted into our heads at\nbreakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and we should\nhave been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable\nrain. But it does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and we shall\ndo delightfully. Oh! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little\ncountry air and quiet! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms. We\nshall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and, as soon as dinner\nis over, if there is time for it, go on to Kingsweston.\"\n\n\"I doubt our being able to do so much,\" said Morland.\n\n\"You croaking fellow!\" cried Thorpe. \"We shall be able to do ten times\nmore. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can\nhear of; but here is your sister says she will not go.\"\n\n\"Blaize Castle!\" cried Catherine. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"The finest place in England worth going fifty miles at any time to\nsee.\"\n\n\"What, is it really a castle, an old castle?\"\n\n\"The oldest in the kingdom.\"\n\n\"But is it like what one reads of?\"\n\n\"Exactly the very same.\"\n\n\"But now really are there towers and long galleries?\"\n\n\"By dozens.\"\n\n\"Then I should like to see it; but I cannot I cannot go.\"\n\n\"Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I cannot go, because\" looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella s\nsmile \"I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a\ncountry walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now,\nas it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.\"\n\n\"Not they indeed,\" cried Thorpe; \"for, as we turned into Broad Street,\nI saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?\"\n\n\"I do not know indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking of the man you danced\nwith last night, are not you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a\nsmart-looking girl.\"\n\n\"Did you indeed?\"\n\n\"Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got\nsome very pretty cattle too.\"\n\n\"It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a\nwalk.\"\n\n\"And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk!\nYou could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the\nwhole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.\"\n\nIsabella corroborated it: \"My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an\nidea of the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.\"\n\n\"I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we go\nup every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, every hole and corner.\"\n\n\"But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is\ndryer, and call by and by?\"\n\n\"Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney\nhallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were\ngoing as far as Wick Rocks.\"\n\n\"Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?\"\n\n\"Just as you please, my dear.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go,\" was the general cry. Mrs.\nAllen was not inattentive to it: \"Well, my dear,\" said she, \"suppose\nyou go.\" And in two minutes they were off.\n\nCatherine s feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very\nunsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great\npleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in\ndegree, however unlike in kind. She could not think the Tilneys had\nacted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement,\nwithout sending her any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later\nthan the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite\nof what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the\ncourse of that hour, she could not from her own observation help\nthinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience. To\nfeel herself slighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the\ndelight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented\nBlaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console\nher for almost anything.\n\nThey passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place,\nwithout the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and she\nmeditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and\nfalse hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle\nBuildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion,\n\"Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?\"\n\n\"Who? Where?\"\n\n\"On the right-hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now.\"\nCatherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother s\narm, walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at\nher. \"Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,\" she impatiently cried; \"it is Miss\nTilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop,\nI will get out this moment and go to them.\" But to what purpose did she\nspeak? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys,\nwho had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight\nround the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself\nwhisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of\nanother street, she entreated him to stop. \"Pray, pray stop, Mr.\nThorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss\nTilney.\" But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his\nhorse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as\nshe was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the\npoint and submit. Her reproaches, however, were not spared. \"How could\nyou deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them\ndriving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the\nworld. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them,\ntoo, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall\nhave no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten\nthousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How could\nyou say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?\" Thorpe defended himself\nvery stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his\nlife, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney\nhimself.\n\nTheir drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very\nagreeable. Catherine s complaisance was no longer what it had been in\ntheir former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies were\nshort. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards _that_, she\nstill looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be\ndisappointed of the promised walk, and especially rather than be\nthought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given up all\nthe happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress\nthrough a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of\nmagnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted the happiness\nof being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a low,\ngrated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp,\nextinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total\ndarkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any\nmischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo\nfrom Morland, who was behind them, made his friend pull up, to know\nwhat was the matter. The others then came close enough for\nconversation, and Morland said, \"We had better go back, Thorpe; it is\ntoo late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have\nbeen exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than\nseven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will\nnever do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much better put it\noff till another day, and turn round.\"\n\n\"It is all one to me,\" replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly\nturning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath.\n\n\"If your brother had not got such a d beast to drive,\" said he soon\nafterwards, \"we might have done it very well. My horse would have\ntrotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have\nalmost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded\njade s pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his\nown.\"\n\n\"No, he is not,\" said Catherine warmly, \"for I am sure he could not\nafford it.\"\n\n\"And why cannot he afford it?\"\n\n\"Because he has not money enough.\"\n\n\"And whose fault is that?\"\n\n\"Nobody s, that I know of.\" Thorpe then said something in the loud,\nincoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being a\nd thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not\nafford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not even\nendeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the\nconsolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less\ndisposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so;\nand they returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words.\n\nAs she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and\nlady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting\noff; that, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady\nhad asked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying\nno, had felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went\naway. Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked\nslowly upstairs. At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on\nhearing the reason of their speedy return, said, \"I am glad your\nbrother had so much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a\nstrange, wild scheme.\"\n\nThey all spent the evening together at Thorpe s. Catherine was\ndisturbed and out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of\ncommerce, in the fate of which she shared, by private partnership with\nMorland, a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn\nat Clifton. Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was\nspoken more than once. \"How I pity the poor creatures that are going\nthere! How glad I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it\nwill be a full ball or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would\nnot be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening\nnow and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I\nknow the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that\nis. But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am\nsure you do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you.\nI dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think\nyourselves of such consequence.\"\n\nCatherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in\ntenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did they\nappear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she\noffered. \"Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,\" she whispered. \"You\nwill quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but\nthe Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual? It\nwas dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I\nshould not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a\nfriend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same;\nhe has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand\nyou have got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would\nfifty times rather you should have them than myself.\"\n\nAnd now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the\ntrue heroine s portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with\ntears. And lucky may she think herself, if she get another good night s\nrest in the course of the next three months.\n\n",

        "raw text": " 12\n\n\n\"Mrs. Allen,\" said Catherine the next morning, \"will there be any harm\nin my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I have\nexplained everything.\"\n\n\"Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney\nalways wears white.\"\n\nCatherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more\nimpatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she might inform\nherself of General Tilney s lodgings, for though she believed they were\nin Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen s\nwavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she\nwas directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened\naway with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her\nconduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and\nresolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see\nher beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to\nbelieve, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without any\nimpediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for\nMiss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not\nquite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave her\ncard. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did\nnot quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss\nTilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left\nthe house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _was_ at home,\nand too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street,\ncould not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in\nexpectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the\nbottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at\na window, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She\nwas followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father,\nand they turned up towards Edgar s Buildings. Catherine, in deep\nmortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herself\nat such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; she\nremembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hers\nmight be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of\nunforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of\nrudeness in return it might justly make her amenable.\n\nDejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the\nothers to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they\nwere not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first\nplace, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the\nsecond, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatre\naccordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her;\nshe feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness\nfor plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were\nhabituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she\nknew, on Isabella s authority, rendered everything else of the kind\n\"quite horrid.\" She was not deceived in her own expectation of\npleasure; the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing\nher during the first four acts, would have supposed she had any\nwretchedness about her. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the\nsudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the\nopposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no\nlonger excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention.\nEvery other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box;\nand, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry\nTilney, without being once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be\nsuspected of indifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn\nfrom the stage during two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look\ntowards her, and he bowed but such a bow! No smile, no continued\nobservance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their\nformer direction. Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost\nhave run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her\nexplanation. Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead\nof considering her own dignity injured by this ready\ncondemnation instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to\nshow her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it, to\nleave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to\nenlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with\nsomebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at\nleast of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of\nexplaining its cause.\n\nThe play concluded the curtain fell Henry Tilney was no longer to be\nseen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained, and perhaps he\nmight be now coming round to their box. She was right; in a few minutes\nhe appeared, and, making his way through the then thinning rows, spoke\nwith like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend. Not with such\ncalmness was he answered by the latter: \"Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been\nquite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have\nthought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs.\nAllen? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone\nout in a phaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten\nthousand times rather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?\"\n\n\"My dear, you tumble my gown,\" was Mrs. Allen s reply.\n\nHer assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away;\nit brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance, and\nhe replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve: \"We\nwere much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk\nafter our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look\nback on purpose.\"\n\n\"But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such\na thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to\nhim as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not Oh! You were\nnot there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have\nstopped, I would have jumped out and run after you.\"\n\nIs there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a\ndeclaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile,\nhe said everything that need be said of his sister s concern, regret,\nand dependence on Catherine s honour. \"Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was\nnot angry,\" cried Catherine, \"because I know she was; for she would not\nsee me this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the\nnext minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted.\nPerhaps you did not know I had been there.\"\n\n\"I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she\nhas been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such\nincivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more than\nthat my father they were just preparing to walk out, and he being\nhurried for time, and not caring to have it put off made a point of her\nbeing denied. That was all, I do assure you. She was very much vexed,\nand meant to make her apology as soon as possible.\"\n\nCatherine s mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something\nof solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question,\nthoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the\ngentleman: \"But, Mr. Tilney, why were _you_ less generous than your\nsister? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could\nsuppose it to be only a mistake, why should _you_ be so ready to take\noffence?\"\n\n\"Me! I take offence!\"\n\n\"Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were\nangry.\"\n\n\"I angry! I could have no right.\"\n\n\"Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.\"\nHe replied by asking her to make room for him, and talking of the play.\n\nHe remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for\nCatherine to be contented when he went away. Before they parted,\nhowever, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon\nas possible; and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,\nshe was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the\nworld.\n\nWhile talking to each other, she had observed with some surprise that\nJohn Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten\nminutes together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and\nshe felt something more than surprise when she thought she could\nperceive herself the object of their attention and discourse. What\ncould they have to say of her? She feared General Tilney did not like\nher appearance: she found it was implied in his preventing her\nadmittance to his daughter, rather than postpone his own walk a few\nminutes. \"How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father?\" was her anxious\ninquiry, as she pointed them out to her companion. He knew nothing\nabout it; but his father, like every military man, had a very large\nacquaintance.\n\nWhen the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in getting\nout. Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry; and, while\nthey waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which\nhad travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue, by\nasking, in a consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking\nwith General Tilney: \"He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout,\nactive looks as young as his son. I have a great regard for him, I\nassure you: a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.\"\n\n\"But how came you to know him?\"\n\n\"Know him! There are few people much about town that I do not know. I\nhave met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again today\nthe moment he came into the billiard-room.

A very fine\nfellow; as rich as a Jew. I should like to dine with him; I dare say he\ngives famous dinners. But what do you think we have been talking of?\nYou. Yes, by heavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in\nBath.\"\n\n\"Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?\"\n\n\"And what do you think I said?\" lowering his voice \"well done, general,\nsaid I; I am quite of your mind.\"\n\nHere Catherine, who was much less gratified by his admiration than by\nGeneral Tilney s, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen. Thorpe,\nhowever, would see her to her chair, and, till she entered it,\ncontinued the same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her\nentreating him to have done.\n\nThat General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her, was very\ndelightful; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the\nfamily whom she need now fear to meet.

        "raw text": " 13\n\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now\npassed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes\nand fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,\nand the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the\nweek. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on\nthe afternoon s Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In\na private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom\nhad particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less\nanxiously placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided\nthe weather were fair, the party should take place on the following\nmorning; and they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in\ngood time. The affair thus determined, and Thorpe s approbation\nsecured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of it. She had left\nthem for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the\nplan was completed, and as soon as she came again, her agreement was\ndemanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella,\nCatherine looked grave, was very sorry, but could not go. The\nengagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former\nattempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now. She had\nthat moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk\ntomorrow; it was quite determined, and she would not, upon any account,\nretract. But that she _must_ and _should_ retract, was instantly the\neager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton tomorrow, they\nwould not go without her, it would be nothing to put off a mere walk\nfor one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal. Catherine was\ndistressed, but not subdued. \"Do not urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to\nMiss Tilney. I cannot go.\" This availed nothing. The same arguments\nassailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they would not hear\nof a refusal. \"It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had\njust been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off\nthe walk till Tuesday.\"\n\n\"No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior\nengagement.\" But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on\nher in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most\nendearing names. She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not\nseriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so\ndearly. She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so\nsweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved. But all\nin vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained\nby such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to\ninfluence her. Isabella then tried another method. She reproached her\nwith having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so\nlittle a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown\ncold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. \"I cannot help being\njealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who\nlove you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not\nin the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are\nstronger than anybody s; I am sure they are too strong for my own\npeace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers\ndoes cut me to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up\neverything else.\"\n\nCatherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it the\npart of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?\nIsabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of\neverything but her own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her\nmind, though she said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied\nher handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,\ncould not help saying, \"Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out\nany longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a\nfriend I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.\"\n\nThis was the first time of her brother s openly siding against her, and\nanxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise. If they\nwould only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily\ndo, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, and\neverybody might then be satisfied. But \"No, no, no!\" was the immediate\nanswer; \"that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not\ngo to town on Tuesday.\" Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and\na short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of\ncold resentment said, \"Very well, then there is an end of the party. If\nCatherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would\nnot, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.\"\n\n\"Catherine, you must go,\" said James.\n\n\"But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters? I dare say\neither of them would like to go.\"\n\n\"Thank ye,\" cried Thorpe, \"but I did not come to Bath to drive my\nsisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d   me if I\ndo. I only go for the sake of driving you.\"\n\n\"That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.\" But her words were\nlost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.\n\nThe three others still continued together, walking in a most\nuncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,\nsometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and\nher arm was still linked within Isabella s, though their hearts were at\nwar. At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; always\ndistressed, but always steady.\n\n\"I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,\" said James;\n\"you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the\nkindest, best-tempered of my sisters.\"\n\n\"I hope I am not less so now,\" she replied, very feelingly; \"but indeed\nI cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.\"\n\n\"I suspect,\" said Isabella, in a low voice, \"there is no great\nstruggle.\"\n\nCatherine s heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no\nopposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined\nby Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, \"Well, I have\nsettled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe\nconscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.\"\n\n\"You have not!\" cried Catherine.\n\n\"I have, upon my soul. Left her this moment. Told her you had sent me\nto say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to\nClifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking\nwith her till Tuesday. She said very well, Tuesday was just as\nconvenient to her; so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty\ngood thought of mine hey?\"\n\nIsabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and\nJames too looked happy again.\n\n\"A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our\ndistresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a\nmost delightful party.\"\n\n\"This will not do,\" said Catherine; \"I cannot submit to this. I must\nrun after Miss Tilney directly and set her right.\"\n\nIsabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and\nremonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry.\nWhen everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday\nwould suit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make\nany further objection.\n\n\"I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.\nIf I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss\nTilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know\nthat Mr. Thorpe has He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into\none act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;\nIsabella, do not hold me.\"\n\nThorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were\nturning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, and\nwere at home by this time.\n\n\"Then I will go after them,\" said Catherine; \"wherever they are I will\ngo after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded\ninto doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.\" And\nwith these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have\ndarted after her, but Morland withheld him. \"Let her go, let her go, if\nshe will go.\"\n\n\"She is as obstinate as \"\n\nThorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a\nproper one.\n\nAway walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would\npermit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As\nshe walked, she reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her to\ndisappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother;\nbut she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclination\napart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney,\nto have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,\nand on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not been\nwithstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted\nmerely her own gratification; _that_ might have been ensured in some\ndegree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had\nattended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their\nopinion. Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to\nrestore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not\nbe at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent,\nshe almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of\nMilsom Street. So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the\nTilneys  advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into their\nlodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still\nremaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying that\nshe must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him\nproceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her, which\nhappened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the\ndrawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter. Her\nexplanation, defective only in being from her irritation of nerves and\nshortness of breath no explanation at all, was instantly given. \"I am\ncome in a great hurry It was all a mistake I never promised to go I\ntold them from the first I could not go. I ran away in a great hurry to\nexplain it. I did not care what you thought of me. I would not stay for\nthe servant.\"\n\nThe business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,\nsoon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe _had_\ngiven the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself\ngreatly surprised by it. But whether her brother had still exceeded her\nin resentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself as\nmuch to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of\nknowing. Whatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager\ndeclarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as\nshe could desire.\n\nThe affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilney to\nher father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitous\npoliteness as recalled Thorpe s information to her mind, and made her\nthink with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on. To such\nanxious attention was the general s civility carried, that not aware of\nher extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry\nwith the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the\napartment herself. \"What did William mean by it? He should make a point\nof inquiring into the matter.\" And if Catherine had not most warmly\nasserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the\nfavour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity.\n\nAfter sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave,\nand was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney s asking her if\nshe would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of\nthe day with her. Miss Tilney added her own wishes. Catherine was\ngreatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen\nwould expect her back every moment. The general declared he could say\nno more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded;\nbut on some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given,\nthey would not refuse to spare her to her friend. \"Oh, no; Catherine\nwas sure they would not have the least objection, and she should have\ngreat pleasure in coming.\" The general attended her himself to the\nstreet-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs,\nadmiring the elasticity of her walk, which corresponded exactly with\nthe spirit of her dancing, and making her one of the most graceful bows\nshe had ever beheld, when they parted.\n\nCatherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to\nPulteney Street, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity,\nthough she had never thought of it before. She reached home without\nseeing anything more of the offended party; and now that she had been\ntriumphant throughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her\nwalk, she began (as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt\nwhether she had been perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and\nif she had given way to their entreaties, she should have been spared\nthe distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a\nscheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through her means.\nTo ease her mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced\nperson what her own conduct had really been, she took occasion to\nmention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the\nThorpes for the following day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. \"Well,\"\nsaid he, \"and do you think of going too?\"\n\n\"No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they\ntold me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could\nI?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes\nare not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country\nin open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and\npublic places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe\nshould allow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs.\nMorland would not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of\nthinking? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?\"\n\n\"Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean\ngown is not five minutes  wear in them. You are splashed getting in and\ngetting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every\ndirection. I hate an open carriage myself.\"\n\n\"I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has\nan odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them\nby young men, to whom they are not even related?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.\"\n\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Catherine, \"then why did not you tell me so before?\nI am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with\nMr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought\nI was doing wrong.\"\n\n\"And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs.\nMorland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But\none must not be over particular. Young people _will_ be young people,\nas your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first\ncame, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do\nnot like to be always thwarted.\"\n\n\"But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you\nwould have found me hard to persuade.\"\n\n\"As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,\" said Mr.\nAllen; \"and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr.\nThorpe any more.\"\n\n\"That is just what I was going to say,\" added his wife.\n\nCatherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a\nmoment s thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper\nand kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of\nwhich she must be as insensible as herself; for she considered that\nIsabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in\nspite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her from\ndoing any such thing. \"You had better leave her alone, my dear; she is\nold enough to know what she is about, and if not, has a mother to\nadvise her. Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however,\nyou had better not interfere. She and your brother choose to go, and\nyou will be only getting ill will.\"\n\nCatherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be\ndoing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen s approbation of her\nown conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the\ndanger of falling into such an error herself. Her escape from being one\nof the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the\nTilneys have thought of her, if she had broken her promise to them in\norder to do what was wrong in itself, if she had been guilty of one\nbreach of propriety, only to enable her to be guilty of another?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 14\n\n\nThe next morning was fair, and Catherine almost expected another attack\nfrom the assembled party. With Mr. Allen to support her, she felt no\ndread of the event: but she would gladly be spared a contest, where\nvictory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore at\nneither seeing nor hearing anything of them. The Tilneys called for her\nat the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no sudden\nrecollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent intrusion to\ndisconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able to\nfulfil her engagement, though it was made with the hero himself. They\ndetermined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whose\nbeautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object\nfrom almost every opening in Bath.\n\n\"I never look at it,\" said Catherine, as they walked along the side of\nthe river, \"without thinking of the south of France.\"\n\n\"You have been abroad then?\" said Henry, a little surprised.\n\n\"Oh! No, I only mean what I have read about. It always puts me in mind\nof the country that Emily and her father travelled through, in The\nMysteries of Udolpho. But you never read novels, I dare say?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better\nbooks.\"\n\n\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good\nnovel, must be intolerably stupid. I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe s\nworks, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho,\nwhen I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember\nfinishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Miss Tilney, \"and I remember that you undertook to read it\naloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to\nanswer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the\nHermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Eleanor a most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland,\nthe injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get\non, refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the\npromise I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at\na most interesting part, by running away with the volume, which, you\nare to observe, was her own, particularly her own. I am proud when I\nreflect on it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of\nliking Udolpho myself. But I really thought before, young men despised\nnovels amazingly.\"\n\n\"It is _amazingly;_ it may well suggest _amazement_ if they do for they\nread nearly as many as women. I myself have read hundreds and hundreds.\nDo not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and\nLouisas. If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasing\ninquiry of  Have you read this?  and  Have you read that?  I shall soon\nleave you as far behind me as what shall I say? I want an appropriate\nsimile. as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when\nshe went with her aunt into Italy. Consider how many years I have had\nthe start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you were\na good little girl working your sampler at home!\"\n\n\"Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think Udolpho\nthe nicest book in the world?\"\n\n\"The nicest by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend\nupon the binding.\"\n\n\"Henry,\" said Miss Tilney, \"you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he\nis treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever finding\nfault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking\nthe same liberty with you. The word  nicest,  as you used it, did not\nsuit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall\nbe overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" cried Catherine, \"I did not mean to say anything wrong;\nbut it _is_ a nice book, and why should not I call it so?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Henry, \"and this is a very nice day, and we are\ntaking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It\nis a very nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps\nit was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or\nrefinement people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or\ntheir choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised\nin that one word.\"\n\n\"While, in fact,\" cried his sister, \"it ought only to be applied to\nyou, without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise.\nCome, Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the\nutmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms\nwe like best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that kind\nof reading?\"\n\n\"To say the truth, I do not much like any other.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and do\nnot dislike travels. But history, real solemn history, I cannot be\ninterested in. Can you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am fond of history.\"\n\n\"I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me\nnothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and\nkings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for\nnothing, and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome: and yet I\noften think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it\nmust be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes  mouths,\ntheir thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention, and\ninvention is what delights me in other books.\"\n\n\"Historians, you think,\" said Miss Tilney, \"are not happy in their\nflights of fancy. They display imagination without raising interest. I\nam fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with\nthe true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in\nformer histories and records, which may be as much depended on, I\nconclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one s own\nobservation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they\nare embellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn\nup, I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made and probably\nwith much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than\nif the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.\"\n\n\"You are fond of history! And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I\nhave two brothers who do not dislike it. So many instances within my\nsmall circle of friends is remarkable! At this rate, I shall not pity\nthe writers of history any longer. If people like to read their books,\nit is all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great\nvolumes, which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look\ninto, to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls,\nalways struck me as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right\nand necessary, I have often wondered at the person s courage that could\nsit down on purpose to do it.\"\n\n\"That little boys and girls should be tormented,\" said Henry, \"is what\nno one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can\ndeny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must\nobserve that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no\nhigher aim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly well\nqualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature\ntime of life. I use the verb  to torment,  as I observed to be your own\nmethod, instead of  to instruct,  supposing them to be now admitted as\nsynonymous.\"\n\n\"You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had\nbeen as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning\ntheir letters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how\nstupid they can be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor\nmother is at the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every\nday of my life at home, you would allow that to _torment_ and to\n_instruct_ might sometimes be used as synonymous words.\"\n\n\"Very probably. But historians are not accountable for the difficulty\nof learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seem\nparticularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, may\nperhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to\nbe tormented for two or three years of one s life, for the sake of\nbeing able to read all the rest of it. Consider if reading had not been\ntaught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not\nhave written at all.\"\n\nCatherine assented and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady s\nmerits closed the subject. The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on\nwhich she had nothing to say. They were viewing the country with the\neyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability of\nbeing formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste. Here\nCatherine was quite lost. She knew nothing of drawing nothing of taste:\nand she listened to them with an attention which brought her little\nprofit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to\nher. The little which she could understand, however, appeared to\ncontradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter\nbefore. It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the\ntop of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of\na fine day. She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance. A misplaced\nshame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant. To\ncome with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of\nadministering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would\nalways wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of\nknowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.\n\nThe advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already\nset forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her treatment\nof the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to the\nlarger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is a\ngreat enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of them\ntoo reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more\nin woman than ignorance. But Catherine did not know her own\nadvantages did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate\nheart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever\nyoung man, unless circumstances are particularly untoward. In the\npresent instance, she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge,\ndeclared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw;\nand a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which his\ninstructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in\neverything admired by him, and her attention was so earnest that he\nbecame perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste.\nHe talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances side-screens\nand perspectives lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful a\nscholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she voluntarily\nrejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a\nlandscape. Delighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her\nwith too much wisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline,\nand by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the\nwithered oak which he had placed near its summit, to oaks in general,\nto forests, the enclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and\ngovernment, he shortly found himself arrived at politics; and from\npolitics, it was an easy step to silence. The general pause which\nsucceeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an\nend to by Catherine, who, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered\nthese words, \"I have heard that something very shocking indeed will\nsoon come out in London.\"\n\nMiss Tilney, to whom this was chiefly addressed, was startled, and\nhastily replied, \"Indeed! And of what nature?\"\n\n\"That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have only heard that it\nis to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.\"\n\n\"Good heaven! Where could you hear of such a thing?\"\n\n\"A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from\nLondon yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect\nmurder and everything of the kind.\"\n\n\"You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend s\naccounts have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known\nbeforehand, proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to\nprevent its coming to effect.\"\n\n\"Government,\" said Henry, endeavouring not to smile, \"neither desires\nnor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; and\ngovernment cares not how much.\"\n\nThe ladies stared. He laughed, and added, \"Come, shall I make you\nunderstand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you\ncan? No I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the\ngenerosity of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no patience\nwith such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the\ncomprehension of yours. Perhaps the abilities of women are neither\nsound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want\nobservation, discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.\"\n\n\"Miss Morland, do not mind what he says; but have the goodness to\nsatisfy me as to this dreadful riot.\"\n\n\"Riot! What riot?\"\n\n\"My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusion\nthere is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more\ndreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three\nduodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a\nfrontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern do you\nunderstand? And you, Miss Morland my stupid sister has mistaken all\nyour clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London and\ninstead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have\ndone, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she\nimmediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling\nin St. George s Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the\nstreets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light\nDragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell\nthe insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment\nof charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a\nbrickbat from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears of the\nsister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means\na simpleton in general.\"\n\nCatherine looked grave. \"And now, Henry,\" said Miss Tilney, \"that you\nhave made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland\nunderstand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably\nrude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in\ngeneral. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.\"\n\n\"I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely before\nher. Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the\nwomen in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom I\nhappen to be in company.\"\n\n\"That is not enough. Be more serious.\"\n\n\"Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of\nwomen than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they\nnever find it necessary to use more than half.\"\n\n\"We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland. He is\nnot in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he must be entirely\nmisunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any\nwoman at all, or an unkind one of me.\"\n\nIt was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never\nbe wrong. His manner might sometimes surprise, but his meaning must\nalways be just: and what she did not understand, she was almost as\nready to admire, as what she did. The whole walk was delightful, and\nthough it ended too soon, its conclusion was delightful too; her\nfriends attended her into the house, and Miss Tilney, before they\nparted, addressing herself with respectful form, as much to Mrs. Allen\nas to Catherine, petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner\non the day after the next. No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen s side,\nand the only difficulty on Catherine s was in concealing the excess of\nher pleasure.\n\nThe morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her\nfriendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or James\nhad crossed her during their walk. When the Tilneys were gone, she\nbecame amiable again, but she was amiable for some time to little\neffect; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her\nanxiety; she had heard nothing of any of them. Towards the end of the\nmorning, however, Catherine, having occasion for some indispensable\nyard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment s delay, walked\nout into the town, and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe\nas she was loitering towards Edgar s Buildings between two of the\nsweetest girls in the world, who had been her dear friends all the\nmorning. From her, she soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken\nplace. \"They set off at eight this morning,\" said Miss Anne, \"and I am\nsure I do not envy them their drive.

She was quite wild to\ngo. She thought it would be something very fine. I cannot say I admire\nher taste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go,\nif they pressed me ever so much.\"\n\nCatherine, a little doubtful of this, could not help answering, \"I wish\nyou could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go.\"\n\n\"Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me. Indeed, I\nwould not have gone on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophia\nwhen you overtook us.\"\n\nCatherine was still unconvinced; but glad that Anne should have the\nfriendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her, she bade her adieu\nwithout much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party had\nnot been prevented by her refusing to join it, and very heartily\nwishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella\nto resent her resistance any longer.\n\n\n\n\n",

You talked of expected horrors in London and instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have done, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George s Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window.

        "raw text": " 15\n\n\nEarly the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness\nin every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a\nmatter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest\nstate of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar s Buildings. The two\nyoungest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne s\nquitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of\nasking the other for some particulars of their yesterday s party. Maria\ndesired no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine\nimmediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful\nscheme in the world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had\nbeen, and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive.\nSuch was the information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded\nthus much in detail that they had driven directly to the York Hotel,\nate some soup, and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the\npump-room, tasted the water, and laid out some shillings in purses and\nspars; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry-cook s, and hurrying\nback to the hotel, swallowed their dinner in haste, to prevent being in\nthe dark; and then had a delightful drive back, only the moon was not\nup, and it rained a little, and Mr. Morland s horse was so tired he\ncould hardly get it along.\n\nCatherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that Blaize\nCastle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was\nnothing to regret for half an instant. Maria s intelligence concluded\nwith a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne, whom she\nrepresented as insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.\n\n\"She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help\nit? John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because\nshe had such thick ankles. I dare say she will not be in good humour\nagain this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a\nlittle matter that puts me out of temper.\"\n\nIsabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such\nhappy importance, as engaged all her friend s notice. Maria was without\nceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began:\n\"Yes, my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not\ndeceived you. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.\"\n\nCatherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.\n\n\"Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,\" continued the other, \"compose\nyourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and\ntalk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my\nnote? Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my\nheart, can judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most\ncharming of men. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will\nyour excellent father and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them\nI am so agitated!\"\n\nCatherine s understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly\ndarted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion,\nshe cried out, \"Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can\nyou can you really be in love with James?\"\n\nThis bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the\nfact. The anxious affection, which she was accused of having\ncontinually watched in Isabella s every look and action, had, in the\ncourse of their yesterday s party, received the delightful confession\nof an equal love. Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James.\nNever had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder,\nand joy. Her brother and her friend engaged! New to such circumstances,\nthe importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated\nit as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life\ncan hardly afford a return. The strength of her feelings she could not\nexpress; the nature of them, however, contented her friend. The\nhappiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the\nfair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy.\n\nDelighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the\nconnection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in\ntender anticipations. \"You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my\nCatherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much\nmore attached to my dear Morland s family than to my own.\"\n\nThis was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.\n\n\"You are so like your dear brother,\" continued Isabella, \"that I quite\ndoted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me;\nthe first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland\ncame to us last Christmas the very first moment I beheld him my heart\nwas irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair\ndone up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John\nintroduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.\"\n\nHere Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though\nexceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, she\nhad never in her life thought him handsome.\n\n\"I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore\nher puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought\nyour brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep a\nwink all night for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless\nnights I have had on your brother s account! I would not have you\nsuffer half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I\nwill not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it.\nI feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking\nof my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would\nbe safe with _you_.\"\n\nCatherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an\nignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point, nor\nrefuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate\nsympathy as Isabella chose to consider her. Her brother, she found, was\npreparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his\nsituation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation\nto the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her, as she\nwas herself persuaded, that her father and mother would never oppose\ntheir son s wishes. \"It is impossible,\" said she, \"for parents to be\nmore kind, or more desirous of their children s happiness; I have no\ndoubt of their consenting immediately.\"\n\n\"Morland says exactly the same,\" replied Isabella; \"and yet I dare not\nexpect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it.\nYour brother, who might marry anybody!\"\n\nHere Catherine again discerned the force of love.\n\n\"Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be\nnothing to signify.\"\n\n\"Oh! My sweet Catherine, in _your_ generous heart I know it would\nsignify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many.\nAs for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had\nI the command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your\nbrother would be my only choice.\"\n\nThis charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty, gave\nCatherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her\nacquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than\nin uttering the grand idea. \"I am sure they will consent,\" was her\nfrequent declaration; \"I am sure they will be delighted with you.\"\n\n\"For my own part,\" said Isabella, \"my wishes are so moderate that the\nsmallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are\nreally attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would\nnot settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired\nvillage would be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about\nRichmond.\"\n\n\"Richmond!\" cried Catherine. \"You must settle near Fullerton. You must\nbe near us.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near\n_you_, I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow\nmyself to think of such things, till we have your father s answer.\nMorland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it\ntomorrow. Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the\nletter. I know it will be the death of me.\"\n\nA reverie succeeded this conviction and when Isabella spoke again, it\nwas to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown.\n\nTheir conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself,\nwho came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire.\nCatherine wished to congratulate him, but knew not what to say, and her\neloquence was only in her eyes. From them, however, the eight parts of\nspeech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with\nease. Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home, his\nadieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he not\nbeen frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that\nhe would go. Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness\nto have him gone. \"Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how\nfar you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven s\nsake, waste no more time. There, go, go I insist on it.\"\n\nThe two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were\ninseparable for the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours\nflew along. Mrs. Thorpe and her son, who were acquainted with\neverything, and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland s consent, to\nconsider Isabella s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance\nimaginable for their family, were allowed to join their counsels, and\nadd their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill\nup the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger\nsisters. To Catherine s simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve\nseemed neither kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its\nunkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out, had its\ninconsistency been less their friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her\nheart at ease by the sagacity of their \"I know what\"; and the evening\nwas spent in a sort of war of wit, a display of family ingenuity, on\none side in the mystery of an affected secret, on the other of\nundefined discovery, all equally acute.\n\nCatherine was with her friend again the next day, endeavouring to\nsupport her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the\ndelivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time of\nreasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more\ndesponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a\nstate of real distress. But when it did come, where could distress be\nfound? \"I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind\nparents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done\nto forward my happiness,\" were the first three lines, and in one moment\nall was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread over\nIsabella s features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her spirits\nbecame almost too high for control, and she called herself without\nscruple the happiest of mortals.\n\nMrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her daughter, her son, her\nvisitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with\nsatisfaction. Her heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was \"dear\nJohn\" and \"dear Catherine\" at every word; \"dear Anne and dear Maria\"\nmust immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two \"dears\" at\nonce before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child\nhad now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He not only\nbestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the\nfinest fellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his\npraise.\n\nThe letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing\nlittle more than this assurance of success; and every particular was\ndeferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabella\ncould well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland s\npromise; his honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what\nmeans their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to be\nresigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her\ndisinterested spirit took no concern. She knew enough to feel secure of\nan honourable and speedy establishment, and her imagination took a\nrapid flight over its attendant felicities. She saw herself at the end\nof a few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at\nFullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a\ncarriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliant\nexhibition of hoop rings on her finger.\n\nWhen the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had\nonly waited its arrival to begin his journey to London, prepared to set\noff. \"Well, Miss Morland,\" said he, on finding her alone in the\nparlour, \"I am come to bid you good-bye.\" Catherine wished him a good\njourney. Without appearing to hear her, he walked to the window,\nfidgeted about, hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.\n\n\"Shall not you be late at Devizes?\" said Catherine. He made no answer;\nbut after a minute s silence burst out with, \"A famous good thing this\nmarrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland s and Belle s.\nWhat do you think of it, Miss Morland? _I_ say it is no bad notion.\"\n\n\"I am sure I think it a very good one.\"\n\n\"Do you? That s honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to\nmatrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song  Going to One\nWedding Brings on Another?  I say, you will come to Belle s wedding, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible.\"\n\n\"And then you know\" twisting himself about and forcing a foolish\nlaugh \"I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old\nsong.\"\n\n\"May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with\nMiss Tilney today, and must now be going home.\"\n\n\"Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may be\ntogether again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a\nfortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.\"\n\n\"Then why do you stay away so long?\" replied Catherine finding that he\nwaited for an answer.\n\n\"That is kind of you, however kind and good-natured. I shall not forget\nit in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody\nliving, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only\ngood nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you\nhave such upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a\ngreat deal better. Good morning to you.\"\n\n\"But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton\nbefore it is long, if not disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you.\"\n\n\"And I hope I hope, Miss Morland, _you_ will not be sorry to see me.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see.\nCompany is always cheerful.\"\n\n\"That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful\ncompany, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only\nbe where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say\nI. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a\nnotion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to _most\nmatters_, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind\nabout.\"\n\n\"By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what\ndoes not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only\nhave the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and\nwhat care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good\nincome of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better.\"\n\n\"Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one\nside, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which\nhas it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune\nlooking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest\nthing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at\nFullerton, whenever it is convenient.\" And away she went. It was not in\nthe power of all his gallantry to detain her longer. With such news to\ncommunicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her departure was not to\nbe delayed by anything in his nature to urge; and she hurried away,\nleaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address,\nand her explicit encouragement.\n\nThe agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her\nbrother s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion\nin Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How\ngreat was her disappointment! The important affair, which many words of\npreparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her\nbrother s arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was\ncomprehended in a wish for the young people s happiness, with a remark,\non the gentleman s side, in favour of Isabella s beauty, and on the\nlady s, of her great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising\ninsensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James s\ngoing to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs.\nAllen. She could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but\nrepeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could\nhave known his intention, wished she could have seen him before he\nwent, as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards\nto his father and mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 16\n\n\nCatherine s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street\nwere so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,\nthough she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly\nwelcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of\nthe party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in the\nexamination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment\npreparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding\nherself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse\nof the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead\nof seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a\nfamily party, he had never said so little, nor been so little\nagreeable; and, in spite of their father s great civilities to her in\nspite of his thanks, invitations, and compliments it had been a release\nto get away from him. It puzzled her to account for all this. It could\nnot be General Tilney s fault. That he was perfectly agreeable and\ngood-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a\ndoubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry s father. _He_ could not\nbe accountable for his children s want of spirits, or for her want of\nenjoyment in his company. The former she hoped at last might have been\naccidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own\nstupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a\ndifferent explanation: \"It was all pride, pride, insufferable\nhaughtiness and pride! She had long suspected the family to be very\nhigh, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss\nTilney s she had never heard of in her life! Not to do the honours of\nher house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with such\nsuperciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!\"\n\n\"But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no\nsuperciliousness; she was very civil.\"\n\n\"Oh! Don t defend her! And then the brother, he, who had appeared so\nattached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people s feelings are\nincomprehensible. And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?\"\n\n\"I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.\"\n\n\"How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my\naversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dear\nCatherine; indeed he is unworthy of you.\"\n\n\"Unworthy! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you. Such fickleness!\nOh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John\nhas the most constant heart.\"\n\n\"But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for\nanybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed\nto be his only care to entertain and make me happy.\"\n\n\"Oh! I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him of pride. I believe he\nis a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him, and John s\njudgment \"\n\n\"Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet\nthem at the rooms.\"\n\n\"And must I go?\"\n\n\"Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled.\"\n\n\"Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. But\ndo not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know,\nwill be some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I\nbeg; _that_ is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me\nto death, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short. Ten to one but he\nguesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I\nshall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.\"\n\nIsabella s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend; she was\nsure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or\nsister; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts.\nThe evening rewarded her confidence; she was met by one with the same\nkindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss\nTilney took pains to be near her, and Henry asked her to dance.\n\nHaving heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,\nCaptain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she was at no loss for\nthe name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she\nhad never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party.\nShe looked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible\nthat some people might think him handsomer than his brother, though, in\nher eyes, his air was more assuming, and his countenance less\nprepossessing. His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly\ninferior; for, within her hearing, he not only protested against every\nthought of dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for\nfinding it possible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed\nthat, whatever might be our heroine s opinion of him, his admiration of\nher was not of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities\nbetween the brothers, nor persecutions to the lady. _He_ cannot be the\ninstigator of the three villains in horsemen s greatcoats, by whom she\nwill hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will\ndrive off with incredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by\npresentiments of such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of\nhaving but a short set to dance down, enjoyed her usual happiness with\nHenry Tilney, listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said; and,\nin finding him irresistible, becoming so herself.\n\nAt the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,\nand, much to Catherine s dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away. They\nretired whispering together; and, though her delicate sensibility did\nnot take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilney\nmust have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her, which he now\nhastened to communicate to his brother, in the hope of separating them\nforever, she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without\nvery uneasy sensations. Her suspense was of full five minutes \nduration; and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an\nhour, when they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry s\nrequesting to know if she thought her friend, Miss Thorpe, would have\nany objection to dancing, as his brother would be most happy to be\nintroduced to her. Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she was\nvery sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was\npassed on to the other, and he immediately walked away.\n\n\"Your brother will not mind it, I know,\" said she, \"because I heard him\nsay before that he hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him\nto think of it. I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she\nmight wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would not\ndance upon any account in the world.\"\n\nHenry smiled, and said, \"How very little trouble it can give you to\nunderstand the motive of other people s actions.\"\n\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What\nis the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings,\nage, situation, and probable habits of life considered but, How should\n_I_ be influenced, What would be _my_ inducement in acting so and so?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly\nwell.\"\n\n\"Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\"\n\n\"Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language.\"\n\n\"But pray tell me what you mean.\"\n\n\"Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of the\nconsequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and\ncertainly bring on a disagreement between us.\"\n\n\"No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of\ndancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your\nbeing superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.\"\n\nCatherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman s predictions were\nverified. There was a something, however, in his words which repaid her\nfor the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her mind so much\nthat she drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and\nalmost forgetting where she was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella,\nshe looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them\nhands across.\n\nIsabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of\nthis extraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it\nwas not quite enough for Catherine s comprehension, she spoke her\nastonishment in very plain terms to her partner.\n\n\"I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not to\ndance.\"\n\n\"And did Isabella never change her mind before?\"\n\n\"Oh! But, because And your brother! After what you told him from me,\nhow could he think of going to ask her?\"\n\n\"I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprised\non your friend s account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother,\nhis conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I\nbelieved him perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an\nopen attraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by\nyourself.\"\n\n\"You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in\ngeneral.\"\n\n\"It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must be\nto be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment;\nand, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by\nno means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.\"\n\nThe friends were not able to get together for any confidential\ndiscourse till all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about\nthe room arm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself: \"I do not wonder\nat your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He is such a\nrattle! Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would\nhave given the world to sit still.\"\n\n\"Then why did not you?\"\n\n\"Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how I\nabhor doing that. I refused him as long as I possibly could, but he\nwould take no denial. You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged him\nto excuse me, and get some other partner but no, not he; after aspiring\nto my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think\nof; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with\nme. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to\nprevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches\nand compliments; and so and so then I found there would be no peace if\nI did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him,\nmight take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he\nwould have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am so\nglad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his\nnonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye\nwas upon us.\"\n\n\"He is very handsome indeed.\"\n\n\"Handsome! Yes, I suppose he may. I dare say people would admire him in\ngeneral; but he is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a florid\ncomplexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he is very well. Amazingly\nconceited, I am sure. I took him down several times, you know, in my\nway.\"\n\nWhen the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject\nto discuss. James Morland s second letter was then received, and the\nkind intentions of his father fully explained. A living, of which Mr.\nMorland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds\nyearly value, was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old\nenough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no\nniggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least\nequal value, moreover, was assured as his future inheritance.\n\nJames expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and\nthe necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could\nmarry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he had expected, was\nborne by him without discontent. Catherine, whose expectations had been\nas unfixed as her ideas of her father s income, and whose judgment was\nnow entirely led by her brother, felt equally well satisfied, and\nheartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly\nsettled.\n\n\"It is very charming indeed,\" said Isabella, with a grave face. \"Mr.\nMorland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,\" said the gentle Mrs.\nThorpe, looking anxiously at her daughter. \"I only wish I could do as\nmuch. One could not expect more from him, you know. If he finds he\n_can_ do more by and by, I dare say he will, for I am sure he must be\nan excellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to\nbegin on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate,\nyou do not consider how little you ever want, my dear.\"\n\n\"It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to be\nthe means of injuring my dear Morland, making him sit down upon an\nincome hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. For\nmyself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.\"\n\n\"I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in\nthe affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a young\nwoman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say\nwhen Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child but do not let us distress our\ndear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so\nvery handsome, you know. I always heard he was a most excellent man;\nand you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a\nsuitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I am\nsure he must be a most liberal-minded man.\"\n\n\"Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. But\neverybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do\nwhat they like with their own money.\" Catherine was hurt by these\ninsinuations. \"I am very sure,\" said she, \"that my father has promised\nto do as much as he can afford.\"\n\nIsabella recollected herself. \"As to that, my sweet Catherine, there\ncannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much\nsmaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that\nmakes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if\nour union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should\nnot have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out.\nThere s the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are\nto pass before your brother can hold the living.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,\" said Mrs. Thorpe, \"we perfectly see\ninto your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand the\npresent vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a\nnoble honest affection.\"\n\nCatherine s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen. She endeavoured to\nbelieve that the delay of the marriage was the only source of\nIsabella s regret; and when she saw her at their next interview as\ncheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a\nminute thought otherwise. James soon followed his letter, and was\nreceived with the most gratifying kindness.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 17\n\n\nThe Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and\nwhether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which\nCatherine listened with a beating heart. To have her acquaintance with\nthe Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance.\nHer whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense,\nand everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should\nbe taken for another fortnight. What this additional fortnight was to\nproduce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney\nmade but a small part of Catherine s speculation. Once or twice indeed,\nsince James s engagement had taught her what _could_ be done, she had\ngot so far as to indulge in a secret \"perhaps,\" but in general the\nfelicity of being with him for the present bounded her views: the\npresent was now comprised in another three weeks, and her happiness\nbeing certain for that period, the rest of her life was at such a\ndistance as to excite but little interest. In the course of the morning\nwhich saw this business arranged, she visited Miss Tilney, and poured\nforth her joyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No\nsooner had she expressed her delight in Mr. Allen s lengthened stay\nthan Miss Tilney told her of her father s having just determined upon\nquitting Bath by the end of another week. Here was a blow! The past\nsuspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present\ndisappointment. Catherine s countenance fell, and in a voice of most\nsincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney s concluding words, \"By the end\nof another week!\"\n\n\"Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I\nthink a fair trial. He has been disappointed of some friends  arrival\nwhom he expected to meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in a\nhurry to get home.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for it,\" said Catherine dejectedly; \"if I had known\nthis before \"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner, \"you would be so\ngood it would make me very happy if \"\n\nThe entrance of her father put a stop to the civility, which Catherine\nwas beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding.\nAfter addressing her with his usual politeness, he turned to his\ndaughter and said, \"Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being\nsuccessful in your application to your fair friend?\"\n\n\"I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.\"\n\n\"Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. My\ndaughter, Miss Morland,\" he continued, without leaving his daughter\ntime to speak, \"has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as\nshe has perhaps told you, on Saturday se nnight. A letter from my\nsteward tells me that my presence is wanted at home; and being\ndisappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General\nCourteney here, some of my very old friends, there is nothing to detain\nme longer in Bath. And could we carry our selfish point with you, we\nshould leave it without a single regret. Can you, in short, be\nprevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your\nfriend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire? I am almost\nashamed to make the request, though its presumption would certainly\nappear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself. Modesty such as\nyours but not for the world would I pain it by open praise. If you can\nbe induced to honour us with a visit, you will make us happy beyond\nexpression.  Tis true, we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of\nthis lively place; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour,\nfor our mode of living, as you see, is plain and unpretending; yet no\nendeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not\nwholly disagreeable.\"\n\nNorthanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine s\nfeelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her grateful and gratified\nheart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of\ntolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have her\ncompany so warmly solicited! Everything honourable and soothing, every\npresent enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and her\nacceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma s\napprobation, was eagerly given. \"I will write home directly,\" said she,\n\"and if they do not object, as I dare say they will not \"\n\nGeneral Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on her\nexcellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction of\nhis wishes. \"Since they can consent to part with you,\" said he, \"we may\nexpect philosophy from all the world.\"\n\nMiss Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in her secondary civilities,\nand the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this\nnecessary reference to Fullerton would allow.\n\nThe circumstances of the morning had led Catherine s feelings through\nthe varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were\nnow safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture,\nwith Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, she hurried\nhome to write her letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on the\ndiscretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their\ndaughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had\nbeen formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post their\nready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, though\nnot more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of\nbeing favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and\nfortune, circumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for\nher advantage. By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she\nhad been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met\nher. Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a\nreturn. Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it.\nThe affection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister. The\nTilneys, they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought\nof, outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which\ntheir intimacy was to be continued. She was to be their chosen visitor,\nshe was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose\nsociety she mostly prized and, in addition to all the rest, this roof\nwas to be the roof of an abbey! Her passion for ancient edifices was\nnext in degree to her passion for Henry Tilney and castles and abbeys\nmade usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill.\nTo see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the\ncloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though\nto be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible\nfor desire. And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against\nher of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned\nup an abbey, and she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages,\nits narrow cells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach,\nand she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends,\nsome awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun.\n\nIt was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the\npossession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be so\nmeekly borne. The power of early habit only could account for it. A\ndistinction to which they had been born gave no pride. Their\nsuperiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of\nperson.\n\nMany were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but so\nactive were her thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, she\nwas hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having been a\nrichly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of its having\nfallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution,\nof a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the\npresent dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of its standing low\nin a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 18\n\n\nWith a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two\nor three days had passed away, without her seeing Isabella for more\nthan a few minutes together. She began first to be sensible of this,\nand to sigh for her conversation, as she walked along the pump-room one\nmorning, by Mrs. Allen s side, without anything to say or to hear; and\nscarcely had she felt a five minutes  longing of friendship, before the\nobject of it appeared, and inviting her to a secret conference, led the\nway to a seat. \"This is my favourite place,\" said she as they sat down\non a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view of\neverybody entering at either; \"it is so out of the way.\"\n\nCatherine, observing that Isabella s eyes were continually bent towards\none door or the other, as in eager expectation, and remembering how\noften she had been falsely accused of being arch, thought the present a\nfine opportunity for being really so; and therefore gaily said, \"Do not\nbe uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.\"\n\n\"Psha! My dear creature,\" she replied, \"do not think me such a\nsimpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow. It would\nbe hideous to be always together; we should be the jest of the place.\nAnd so you are going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is\none of the finest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend\nupon a most particular description of it.\"\n\n\"You shall certainly have the best in my power to give. But who are you\nlooking for? Are your sisters coming?\"\n\n\"I am not looking for anybody. One s eyes must be somewhere, and you\nknow what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are\nan hundred miles off. I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most\nabsent creature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case with\nminds of a certain stamp.\"\n\n\"But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My\npoor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just\nhad a letter from John; you can guess the contents.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I cannot.\"\n\n\"My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he write\nabout, but yourself? You know he is over head and ears in love with\nyou.\"\n\n\"With _me_, dear Isabella!\"\n\n\"Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and\nall that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty\nis sometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so\noverstrained! It is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such\nas a child must have noticed. And it was but half an hour before he\nleft Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement. He says so\nin this letter, says that he as good as made you an offer, and that you\nreceived his advances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge\nhis suit, and say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain\nto affect ignorance.\"\n\nCatherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her\nastonishment at such a charge, protesting her innocence of every\nthought of Mr. Thorpe s being in love with her, and the consequent\nimpossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him. \"As to any\nattentions on his side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was\nsensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the\nfirst day of his coming. And as to making me an offer, or anything like\nit, there must be some unaccountable mistake. I could not have\nmisunderstood a thing of that kind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be\nbelieved, I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever\npassed between us. The last half hour before he went away! It must be\nall and completely a mistake for I did not see him once that whole\nmorning.\"\n\n\"But _that_ you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in\nEdgar s Buildings it was the day your father s consent came and I am\npretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time\nbefore you left the house.\"\n\n\"Are you? Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say but for the life\nof me, I cannot recollect it. I _do_ remember now being with you, and\nseeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five\nminutes However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass\non his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,\nthat I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind\nfrom him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for\nme but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had\nthe smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and\ntell him I beg his pardon that is I do not know what I ought to say but\nmake him understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not\nspeak disrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but\nyou know very well that if I could think of one man more than\nanother _he_ is not the person.\" Isabella was silent. \"My dear friend,\nyou must not be angry with me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so\nvery much about me. And, you know, we shall still be sisters.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes\" (with a blush), \"there are more ways than one of our being\nsisters. But where am I wandering to? Well, my dear Catherine, the case\nseems to be that you are determined against poor John is not it so?\"\n\n\"I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meant\nto encourage it.\"\n\n\"Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further.\nJohn desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have.\nBut I confess, as soon as I read his letter, I thought it a very\nfoolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good of\neither; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together?\nYou have both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that\nwill support a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say,\nthere is no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it;\nhe could not have received my last.\"\n\n\"You _do_ acquit me, then, of anything wrong? You are convinced that I\nnever meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me\ntill this moment?\"\n\n\"Oh! As to that,\" answered Isabella laughingly, \"I do not pretend to\ndetermine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been.\nAll that is best known to yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so\nwill occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than\none wishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last\nperson in the world to judge you severely. All those things should be\nallowed for in youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you\nknow, one may not mean the next. Circumstances change, opinions alter.\"\n\n\"But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the\nsame. You are describing what never happened.\"\n\n\"My dearest Catherine,\" continued the other without at all listening to\nher, \"I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into\nan engagement before you knew what you were about. I do not think\nanything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your\nhappiness merely to oblige my brother, because he is my brother, and\nwho perhaps after all, you know, might be just as happy without you,\nfor people seldom know what they would be at, young men especially,\nthey are so amazingly changeable and inconstant. What I say is, why\nshould a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s? You know\nI carry my notions of friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my\ndear Catherine, do not be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you\nare in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. Tilney\nsays there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of\ntheir own affections, and I believe he is very right. Ah! Here he\ncomes; never mind, he will not see us, I am sure.\"\n\nCatherine, looking up, perceived Captain Tilney; and Isabella,\nearnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke, soon caught his notice.\nHe approached immediately, and took the seat to which her movements\ninvited him. His first address made Catherine start. Though spoken low,\nshe could distinguish, \"What! Always to be watched, in person or by\nproxy!\"\n\n\"Psha, nonsense!\" was Isabella s answer in the same half whisper. \"Why\ndo you put such things into my head? If I could believe it my spirit,\nyou know, is pretty independent.\"\n\n\"I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.\"\n\n\"My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men have\nnone of you any hearts.\"\n\n\"If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.\"\n\n\"Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so\ndisagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you\"\n(turning her back on him); \"I hope your eyes are not tormented now.\"\n\n\"Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at\nonce too much and too little.\"\n\nCatherine heard all this, and quite out of countenance, could listen no\nlonger. Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her\nbrother, she rose up, and saying she should join Mrs. Allen, proposed\ntheir walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She was so\namazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room;\nand if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was\nexpecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine must\nexcuse her, and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could be\nstubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their\nreturning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leaving\nIsabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did\nshe thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling\nin love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him;\nunconsciously it must be, for Isabella s attachment to James was as\ncertain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth or\ngood intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their\nconversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talked\nmore like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not\nlooked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that\nshe should not perceive his admiration! Catherine longed to give her a\nhint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which her\ntoo lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her\nbrother.\n\nThe compliment of John Thorpe s affection did not make amends for this\nthoughtlessness in his sister. She was almost as far from believing as\nfrom wishing it to be sincere; for she had not forgotten that he could\nmistake, and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement\nconvinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious. In\nvanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was in\nwonder. That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in\nlove with her was a matter of lively astonishment. Isabella talked of\nhis attentions; _she_ had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had\nsaid many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste, and would\nnever be said again; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for\npresent ease and comfort.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 19\n\n\nA few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to\nsuspect her friend, could not help watching her closely. The result of\nher observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered\ncreature. When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate\nfriends in Edgar s Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners\nwas so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed\nunnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted\nabsence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would\noccasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, _that_\nmight only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But\nwhen Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney s attentions\nas readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share\nwith James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive\nto be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what\nher friend could be at, was beyond her comprehension. Isabella could\nnot be aware of the pain she was inflicting; but it was a degree of\nwilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was\nthe sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his\npresent comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to\n_her_ it was always an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she was\ngreatly concerned. Though his looks did not please her, his name was a\npassport to her goodwill, and she thought with sincere compassion of\nhis approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what she had believed\nherself to overhear in the pump-room, his behaviour was so incompatible\nwith a knowledge of Isabella s engagement that she could not, upon\nreflection, imagine him aware of it. He might be jealous of her brother\nas a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in\nher misapprehension. She wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind\nIsabella of her situation, and make her aware of this double\nunkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension\nwas always against her. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never\nunderstand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney\nfamily became her chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire\nwas to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney s removal would\nat least restore peace to every heart but his own. But Captain Tilney\nhad at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the party\nto Northanger; he was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this,\nher resolution was directly made. She spoke to Henry Tilney on the\nsubject, regretting his brother s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe,\nand entreating him to make known her prior engagement.\n\n\"My brother does know it,\" was Henry s answer.\n\n\"Does he? Then why does he stay here?\"\n\nHe made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she\neagerly continued, \"Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longer\nhe stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his\nown sake, and for everybody s sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence\nwill in time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here,\nand it is only staying to be miserable.\"\n\nHenry smiled and said, \"I am sure my brother would not wish to do\nthat.\"\n\n\"Then you will persuade him to go away?\"\n\n\"Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even\nendeavour to persuade him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is\nengaged. He knows what he is about, and must be his own master.\"\n\n\"No, he does not know what he is about,\" cried Catherine; \"he does not\nknow the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told me\nso, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"And are you sure it is my brother s doing?\"\n\n\"Yes, very sure.\"\n\n\"Is it my brother s attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe s\nadmission of them, that gives the pain?\"\n\n\"Is not it the same thing?\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended\nby another man s admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only\nwho can make it a torment.\"\n\nCatherine blushed for her friend, and said, \"Isabella is wrong. But I\nam sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my\nbrother. She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and\nwhile my father s consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost\ninto a fever. You know she must be attached to him.\"\n\n\"I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with\nanother.\"\n\n\"It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so well,\nas she might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a\nlittle.\"\n\nAfter a short pause, Catherine resumed with, \"Then you do not believe\nIsabella so very much attached to my brother?\"\n\n\"I can have no opinion on that subject.\"\n\n\"But what can your brother mean? If he knows her engagement, what can\nhe mean by his behaviour?\"\n\n\"You are a very close questioner.\"\n\n\"Am I? I only ask what I want to be told.\"\n\n\"But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother s heart.\"\n\n\"My brother s heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure\nyou I can only guess at.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves.\nTo be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are\nbefore you. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless\nyoung man; he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend, and\nhe has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Catherine, after some moments  consideration, \"_you_ may\nbe able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this; but I am\nsure I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not\nhe want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak\nto him, he would go.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Morland,\" said Henry, \"in this amiable solicitude for\nyour brother s comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not\ncarried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account\nor Miss Thorpe s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her\ngood behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain\nTilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him\nonly when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this and you may\nbe sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say,  Do not be\nuneasy,  because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as\nlittle uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of\nyour brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real\njealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no\ndisagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open\nto each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what\nis required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will\nnever tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.\"\n\nPerceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, \"Though\nFrederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a\nvery short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of\nabsence will soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what\nwill then be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella\nThorpe for a fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor\nTilney s passion for a month.\"\n\nCatherine would contend no longer against comfort. She had resisted its\napproaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her\ncaptive. Henry Tilney must know best. She blamed herself for the extent\nof her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject\nagain.\n\nHer resolution was supported by Isabella s behaviour in their parting\ninterview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine s stay in\nPulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her\nuneasiness, or make her quit them in apprehension. James was in\nexcellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her tenderness\nfor her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but that\nat such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flat\ncontradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine\nremembered Henry s instructions, and placed it all to judicious\naffection. The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones\nmay be fancied.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 20\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend, whose good\nhumour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion, and in the\npromotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased. Her\nhappiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishing\nit otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Bath\nthemselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt. Mr. Allen\nattended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw her\nseated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was\nher agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful\nwas she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to\npreserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first\nfive minutes, she could almost have wished to return with him to\nPulteney Street.\n\nMiss Tilney s manners and Henry s smile soon did away some of her\nunpleasant feelings; but still she was far from being at ease; nor\ncould the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure\nher. Nay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have\nfelt less, had she been less attended to. His anxiety for her\ncomfort his continual solicitations that she would eat, and his\noften-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never\nin her life before had she beheld half such variety on a\nbreakfast-table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that\nshe was a visitor. She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew\nnot how to reply to it. Her tranquillity was not improved by the\ngeneral s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the\ndispleasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last\ncame down. She was quite pained by the severity of his father s\nreproof, which seemed disproportionate to the offence; and much was her\nconcern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the\nlecture, and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being\ndisrespectful to her. This was placing her in a very uncomfortable\nsituation, and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney, without\nbeing able to hope for his goodwill.\n\nHe listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence,\nwhich confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, on\nIsabella s account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been the\nreal cause of his rising late. It was the first time of her being\ndecidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to form her\nopinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father\nremained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spirits\naffected, she could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper\nto Eleanor, \"How glad I shall be when you are all off.\"\n\nThe bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while the\ntrunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of\nMilsom Street by that hour. His greatcoat, instead of being brought for\nhim to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he was\nto accompany his son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out,\nthough there were three people to go in it, and his daughter s maid had\nso crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to\nsit; and, so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed\nher in, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk\nfrom being thrown out into the street. At last, however, the door was\nclosed upon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in\nwhich the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually\nperform a journey of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger\nfrom Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine s spirits\nrevived as they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no\nrestraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an\nabbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath\nwithout any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected\nit. The tediousness of a two hours  wait at Petty France, in which\nthere was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and\nloiter about without anything to see, next followed and her admiration\nof the style in which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and\nfour postilions handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their\nstirrups, and numerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under\nthis consequent inconvenience. Had their party been perfectly\nagreeable, the delay would have been nothing; but General Tilney,\nthough so charming a man, seemed always a check upon his children s\nspirits, and scarcely anything was said but by himself; the observation\nof which, with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and his\nangry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine grow every moment more\nin awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four. At\nlast, however, the order of release was given; and much was Catherine\nthen surprised by the general s proposal of her taking his place in his\nson s curricle for the rest of the journey: \"the day was fine, and he\nwas anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible.\"\n\nThe remembrance of Mr. Allen s opinion, respecting young men s open\ncarriages, made her blush at the mention of such a plan, and her first\nthought was to decline it; but her second was of greater deference for\nGeneral Tilney s judgment; he could not propose anything improper for\nher; and, in the course of a few minutes, she found herself with Henry\nin the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trial\nconvinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;\nthe chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it\nwas a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forget\nits having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would have\nbeen enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses\ndisposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his own\ncarriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a\nminute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;\nHenry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance, without\nparading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only\ngentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with! And\nthen his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat\nlooked so becomingly important! To be driven by him, next to being\ndancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In\naddition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to her\nown praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister s account, for her\nkindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as real\nfriendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His sister, he\nsaid, was uncomfortably circumstanced she had no female companion and,\nin the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any\ncompanion at all.\n\n\"But how can that be?\" said Catherine. \"Are not you with her?\"\n\n\"Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at\nmy own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my\nfather s, and some of my time is necessarily spent there.\"\n\n\"How sorry you must be for that!\"\n\n\"I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.\"\n\n\"Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of the\nabbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary\nparsonage-house must be very disagreeable.\"\n\nHe smiled, and said, \"You have formed a very favourable idea of the\nabbey.\"\n\n\"To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one\nreads about?\"\n\n\"And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such\nas  what one reads about  may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves\nfit for sliding panels and tapestry?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there\nwould be so many people in the house and besides, it has never been\nuninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back\nto it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.\"\n\n\"No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly\nlighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread\nour beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.\nBut you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)\nintroduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart\nfrom the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end\nof the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient\nhousekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages,\ninto an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about\ntwenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not\nyour mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too\nlofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp\nto take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as\nlarge as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet,\npresenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.\"\n\n\"How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And\nwhat will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,\nbut on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a\nponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace the\nportrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so\nincomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your\neyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,\ngazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.\nTo raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that\nthe part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs\nyou that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this\nparting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her\nreceding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when,\nwith fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,\nwith increased alarm, that it has no lock.\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot\nreally happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.\nWell, what then?\"\n\n\"Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After\nsurmounting your _unconquerable_ horror of the bed, you will retire to\nrest, and get a few hours  unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at\nfarthest the _third_ night after your arrival, you will probably have a\nviolent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice\nto its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during\nthe frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think\nyou discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging\nmore violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your\ncuriosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will\ninstantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to\nexamine this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a\ndivision in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the\nminutest inspection, and on opening it, a door will immediately\nappear which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you\nwill, after a few efforts, succeed in opening and, with your lamp in\nyour hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.\"\n\n\"What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a\nsecret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the\nchapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so\nsimple an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted\nroom, and through this into several others, without perceiving anything\nvery remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in\nanother a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some\ninstrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the\ncommon way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return\ntowards your own apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted\nroom, however, your eyes will be attracted towards a large,\nold-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold, which, though narrowly\nexamining the furniture before, you had passed unnoticed. Impelled by\nan irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly advance to it, unlock\nits folding doors, and search into every drawer but for some time\nwithout discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a\nconsiderable hoard of diamonds. At last, however, by touching a secret\nspring, an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you\nseize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the\nprecious treasure into your own chamber, but scarcely have you been\nable to decipher  Oh! Thou whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands\nthese memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall  when your lamp suddenly\nexpires in the socket, and leaves you in total darkness.\"\n\n\"Oh! No, no do not say so. Well, go on.\"\n\nBut Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able\nto carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of\nsubject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy\nin the perusal of Matilda s woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew\nashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her\nattention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really\nmeeting with what he related. \"Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never\nput her into such a chamber as he had described! She was not at all\nafraid.\"\n\nAs they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight\nof the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects\nvery different returned in full force, and every bend in the road was\nexpected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey\nstone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of\nthe sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But\nso low did the building stand, that she found herself passing through\nthe great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger,\nwithout having discerned even an antique chimney.\n\nShe knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was a\nsomething in this mode of approach which she certainly had not\nexpected. To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find\nherself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven\nso rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle,\nalarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent.\nShe was not long at leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden\nscud of rain, driving full in her face, made it impossible for her to\nobserve anything further, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of\nher new straw bonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was\nspringing, with Henry s assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the\nshelter of the old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her\nfriend and the general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one\nawful foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment s suspicion\nof any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The\nbreeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had\nwafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a\ngood shake to her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common\ndrawing-room, and capable of considering where she was.\n\nAn abbey! Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey! But she\ndoubted, as she looked round the room, whether anything within her\nobservation would have given her the consciousness. The furniture was\nin all the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where\nshe had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times,\nwas contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome\nmarble, and ornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The\nwindows, to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having\nheard the general talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with\nreverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be\nsure, the pointed arch was preserved the form of them was Gothic they\nmight be even casements but every pane was so large, so clear, so\nlight! To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions,\nand the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the\ndifference was very distressing.\n\nThe general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of the\nsmallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where\neverything, being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.;\nflattering himself, however, that there were some apartments in the\nAbbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the costly\ngilding of one in particular, when, taking out his watch, he stopped\nshort to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This\nseemed the word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away\nby Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest\npunctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger.\n\nReturning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad\nstaircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many\nlanding-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery. On one side it\nhad a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows which\nCatherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before\nMiss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope\nshe would find it comfortable, left her with an anxious entreaty that\nshe would make as little alteration as possible in her dress.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 21\n\n\nA moment s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment\nwas very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the\ndescription of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained\nneither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was\ncarpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those\nof the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest\nfashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room\naltogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease on\nthis point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of\nanything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay.\nHer habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she was\npreparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had\nconveyed for her immediate accommodation, when her eye suddenly fell on\na large high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the\nfireplace. The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything\nelse, she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts\ncrossed her:\n\n\"This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An\nimmense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?\nPushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into\nit cost me what it may, I will look into it and directly too by\ndaylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out.\" She advanced\nand examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some\ndarker wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved\nstand of the same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at\neach end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken\nperhaps prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the\nlid, was a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it\nintently, but without being able to distinguish anything with\ncertainty. She could not, in whatever direction she took it, believe\nthe last letter to be a _T;_ and yet that it should be anything else in\nthat house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of\nastonishment. If not originally theirs, by what strange events could it\nhave fallen into the Tilney family?\n\nHer fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,\nwith trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards\nto satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for\nsomething seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few\ninches; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room\nmade her, starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming\nviolence. This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney s maid, sent by her\nmistress to be of use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately\ndismissed her, it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be\ndoing, and forced her, in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this\nmystery, to proceed in her dressing without further delay. Her progress\nwas not quick, for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the\nobject so well calculated to interest and alarm; and though she dared\nnot waste a moment upon a second attempt, she could not remain many\npaces from the chest. At length, however, having slipped one arm into\nher gown, her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of\nher curiosity might safely be indulged. One moment surely might be\nspared; and, so desperate should be the exertion of her strength, that,\nunless secured by supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be\nthrown back. With this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence\ndid not deceive her. Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave\nto her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly\nfolded, reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession!\n\nShe was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,\nanxious for her friend s being ready, entered the room, and to the\nrising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd\nexpectation, was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a\nsearch. \"That is a curious old chest, is not it?\" said Miss Tilney, as\nCatherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass. \"It is\nimpossible to say how many generations it has been here. How it came to\nbe first put in this room I know not, but I have not had it moved,\nbecause I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and\nbonnets. The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open.\nIn that corner, however, it is at least out of the way.\"\n\nCatherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her\ngown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. Miss\nTilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute they\nran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General\nTilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having,\non the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence,\nordered \"Dinner to be on table _directly!_\"\n\nCatherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke, and sat pale\nand breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his children, and\ndetesting old chests; and the general, recovering his politeness as he\nlooked at her, spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for\nso foolishly hurrying her fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath\nfrom haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the\nworld: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of\nhaving involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton\nherself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the\ngeneral s complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her own, restored\nher to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in its\ndimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use,\nand fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on\nthe unpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its\nspaciousness and the number of their attendants. Of the former, she\nspoke aloud her admiration; and the general, with a very gracious\ncountenance, acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room,\nand further confessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most\npeople, he did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the\nnecessaries of life; he supposed, however, \"that she must have been\nused to much better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen s?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" was Catherine s honest assurance; \"Mr. Allen s\ndining-parlour was not more than half as large,\" and she had never seen\nso large a room as this in her life. The general s good humour\nincreased. Why, as he _had_ such rooms, he thought it would be simple\nnot to make use of them; but, upon his honour, he believed there might\nbe more comfort in rooms of only half their size. Mr. Allen s house, he\nwas sure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness.\n\nThe evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the\noccasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness.\nIt was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue\nfrom her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or\nrestraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she could\nthink of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them.\n\nThe night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole\nafternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained\nviolently. Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest\nwith sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of\nthe ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt\nfor the first time that she was really in an abbey. Yes, these were\ncharacteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless\nvariety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings\nhad witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she\nrejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within\nwalls so solemn! _She_ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or\ndrunken gallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had\ntold her that morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she\ncould have nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom\nas securely as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely\nfortifying her mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled,\nespecially on perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from\nher, to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits\nwere immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. \"How\nmuch better is this,\" said she, as she walked to the fender \"how much\nbetter to find a fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the\ncold till all the family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been\nobliged to do, and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one\nby coming in with a faggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what it\nis! If it had been like some other places, I do not know that, in such\na night as this, I could have answered for my courage: but now, to be\nsure, there is nothing to alarm one.\"\n\nShe looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. It\ncould be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the\ndivisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelessly\nhumming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously\nbehind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare\nher, and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest\nconviction of the wind s force. A glance at the old chest, as she\nturned away from this examination, was not without its use; she scorned\nthe causeless fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy\nindifference to prepare herself for bed. \"She should take her time; she\nshould not hurry herself; she did not care if she were the last person\nup in the house. But she would not make up her fire; _that_ would seem\ncowardly, as if she wished for the protection of light after she were\nin bed.\" The fire therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the\nbest part of an hour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of\nstepping into bed, when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she\nwas struck by the appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet,\nwhich, though in a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her\nnotice before. Henry s words, his description of the ebony cabinet\nwhich was to escape her observation at first, immediately rushed across\nher; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was\nsomething whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence!\nShe took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet. It was not\nabsolutely ebony and gold; but it was japan, black and yellow japan of\nthe handsomest kind; and as she held her candle, the yellow had very\nmuch the effect of gold. The key was in the door, and she had a strange\nfancy to look into it; not, however, with the smallest expectation of\nfinding anything, but it was so very odd, after what Henry had said. In\nshort, she could not sleep till she had examined it. So, placing the\ncandle with great caution on a chair, she seized the key with a very\ntremulous hand and tried to turn it; but it resisted her utmost\nstrength. Alarmed, but not discouraged, she tried it another way; a\nbolt flew, and she believed herself successful; but how strangely\nmysterious! The door was still immovable. She paused a moment in\nbreathless wonder. The wind roared down the chimney, the rain beat in\ntorrents against the windows, and everything seemed to speak the\nawfulness of her situation. To retire to bed, however, unsatisfied on\nsuch a point, would be vain, since sleep must be impossible with the\nconsciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate\nvicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the key, and after\nmoving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined\ncelerity of hope s last effort, the door suddenly yielded to her hand:\nher heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and having thrown\nopen each folding door, the second being secured only by bolts of less\nwonderful construction than the lock, though in that her eye could not\ndiscern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers appeared in\nview, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in the centre,\na small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all\nprobability a cavity of importance.\n\nCatherine s heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a\ncheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers\ngrasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely\nempty. With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a\nthird, a fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched,\nand in not one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a\ntreasure, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not\nescape her, and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The\nplace in the middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had\n\"never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any\npart of the cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill\nsuccess thus far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly\nwhile she was about it.\" It was some time however before she could\nunfasten the door, the same difficulty occurring in the management of\nthis inner lock as of the outer; but at length it did open; and not\nvain, as hitherto, was her search; her quick eyes directly fell on a\nroll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity,\napparently for concealment, and her feelings at that moment were\nindescribable. Her heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks\ngrew pale. She seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript,\nfor half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while\nshe acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of\nwhat Henry had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before\nshe attempted to rest.\n\nThe dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with\nalarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet\nsome hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty\nin distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might\noccasion, she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished\nin one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect.\nCatherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done\ncompletely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the\nrekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room.\nA violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to\nthe moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which\nsucceeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant\ndoor struck on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more.\nA cold sweat stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand,\nand groping her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some\nsuspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close\nher eyes in sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the\nquestion. With a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every\nway so agitated, repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too\nabroad so dreadful! She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but\nnow every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript\nso wonderfully found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning s\nprediction, how was it to be accounted for? What could it contain? To\nwhom could it relate? By what means could it have been so long\nconcealed? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to\ndiscover it! Till she had made herself mistress of its contents,\nhowever, she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun s\nfirst rays she was determined to peruse it. But many were the tedious\nhours which must yet intervene. She shuddered, tossed about in her bed,\nand envied every quiet sleeper. The storm still raged, and various were\nthe noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals\non her startled ear. The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment\nin motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by\nthe attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along\nthe gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of\ndistant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine\nhad heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the\ntempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 22\n\n\nThe housemaid s folding back her window-shutters at eight o clock the\nnext day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she opened her\neyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of\ncheerfulness; her fire was already burning, and a bright morning had\nsucceeded the tempest of the night. Instantaneously, with the\nconsciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the\nmanuscript; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid s\ngoing away, she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst\nfrom the roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the\nluxury of their perusal on her pillow. She now plainly saw that she\nmust not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of\nwhat she had shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist\nentirely of small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling\nsize, and much less than she had supposed it to be at first.\n\nHer greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import.\nCould it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An\ninventory of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that\nwas before her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a\nwashing-bill in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same\narticles with little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth\npresented nothing new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced\nher in each. Two others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure\nscarcely more interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and\nbreeches-ball. And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest,\nseemed by its first cramp line, \"To poultice chestnut mare\" a farrier s\nbill! Such was the collection of papers (left perhaps, as she could\nthen suppose, by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she\nhad taken them) which had filled her with expectation and alarm, and\nrobbed her of half her night s rest! She felt humbled to the dust.\nCould not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom? A corner\nof it, catching her eye as she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment\nagainst her. Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her\nrecent fancies. To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back\ncould have remained undiscovered in a room such as that, so modern, so\nhabitable! Or that she should be the first to possess the skill of\nunlocking a cabinet, the key of which was open to all!\n\nHow could she have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that Henry\nTilney should ever know her folly! And it was in a great measure his\nown doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with\nhis description of her adventures, she should never have felt the\nsmallest curiosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred.\nImpatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those\ndetestable papers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and\nfolding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before,\nreturned them to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty\nwish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to\ndisgrace her even with herself.\n\nWhy the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still\nsomething remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease.\nIn this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in the\nflattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the\ndoor s having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its\nfastener, darted into her head, and cost her another blush.\n\nShe got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct\nproduced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speed\nto the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by Miss\nTilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his immediate\nhope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch\nreference to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather\ndistressing. For the world would she not have her weakness suspected,\nand yet, unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to\nacknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little. \"But we have a\ncharming morning after it,\" she added, desiring to get rid of the\nsubject; \"and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over.\nWhat beautiful hyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.\"\n\n\"And how might you learn? By accident or argument?\"\n\n\"Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take\npains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I\nsaw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent\nabout flowers.\"\n\n\"But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a new\nsource of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon\nhappiness as possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable\nin your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you\nto more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the\nlove of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment\nonce raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?\"\n\n\"But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The\npleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in\nfine weather I am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never\nwithin.\"\n\n\"At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a\nhyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a\nteachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has\nmy sister a pleasant mode of instruction?\"\n\nCatherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the\nentrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy\nstate of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did\nnot advance her composure.\n\nThe elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine s notice\nwhen they were seated at table; and, luckily, it had been the general s\nchoice. He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed it\nto be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of\nhis country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as\nwell flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden\nor S ve. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago. The\nmanufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen some\nbeautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectly\nwithout vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new\nset. He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of\nselecting one though not for himself. Catherine was probably the only\none of the party who did not understand him.\n\nShortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business\nrequired and would keep him two or three days. They all attended in the\nhall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering the\nbreakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching\nanother glimpse of his figure. \"This is a somewhat heavy call upon your\nbrother s fortitude,\" observed the general to Eleanor. \"Woodston will\nmake but a sombre appearance today.\"\n\n\"Is it a pretty place?\" asked Catherine.\n\n\"What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell\nthe taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it\nwould be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many\nrecommendations. The house stands among fine meadows facing the\nsouth-east, with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the\nwalls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago,\nfor the benefit of my son. It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the\nproperty in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care\nthat it shall not be a bad one. Did Henry s income depend solely on\nthis living, he would not be ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd,\nthat with only two younger children, I should think any profession\nnecessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all\nwish him disengaged from every tie of business. But though I may not\nexactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss\nMorland, would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every\nyoung man some employment. The money is nothing, it is not an object,\nbut employment is the thing. Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see,\nwho will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any\nprivate man in the county, has his profession.\"\n\nThe imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes. The\nsilence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable.\n\nSomething had been said the evening before of her being shown over the\nhouse, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though\nCatherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it\nwas a proposal of too much happiness in itself, under any\ncircumstances, not to be gladly accepted; for she had been already\neighteen hours in the abbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The\nnetting-box, just leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste,\nand she was ready to attend him in a moment. \"And when they had gone\nover the house, he promised himself moreover the pleasure of\naccompanying her into the shrubberies and garden.\" She curtsied her\nacquiescence. \"But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make\nthose her first object. The weather was at present favourable, and at\nthis time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so.\nWhich would she prefer? He was equally at her service. Which did his\ndaughter think would most accord with her fair friend s wishes? But he\nthought he could discern. Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland s eyes\na judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather. But\nwhen did she judge amiss? The abbey would be always safe and dry. He\nyielded implicitly, and would fetch his hat and attend them in a\nmoment.\" He left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious\nface, began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them\nout of doors against his own inclination, under a mistaken idea of\npleasing her; but she was stopped by Miss Tilney s saying, with a\nlittle confusion, \"I believe it will be wisest to take the morning\nwhile it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my father s account; he\nalways walks out at this time of day.\"\n\nCatherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Why was\nMiss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on the\ngeneral s side to show her over the abbey? The proposal was his own.\nAnd was not it odd that he should _always_ take his walk so early?\nNeither her father nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very\nprovoking. She was all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely\nany curiosity about the grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed!\nBut now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it. Such\nwere her thoughts, but she kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet\nin patient discontent.\n\nShe was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of the\nabbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn. The whole\nbuilding enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich\nin Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder was\nshut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the\nsteep woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful\neven in the leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to\ncompare with it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that\nwithout waiting for any better authority, she boldly burst forth in\nwonder and praise. The general listened with assenting gratitude; and\nit seemed as if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed\ntill that hour.\n\nThe kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to it\nacross a small portion of the park.\n\nThe number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine\ncould not listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent\nof all Mr. Allen s, as well as her father s, including church-yard and\norchard. The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a\nvillage of hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to\nbe at work within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her looks\nof surprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her to\ntell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to\nthem before; and he then modestly owned that, \"without any ambition of\nthat sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them\nto be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he had a hobby-horse, it was\n_that_. He loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of\neating, he loved good fruit or if he did not, his friends and children\ndid. There were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as\nhis. The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits.\nThe pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he\nsupposed, must feel these inconveniences as well as himself.\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never\nwent into it.\"\n\nWith a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished he\ncould do the same, for he never entered his, without being vexed in\nsome way or other, by its falling short of his plan.\n\n\"How were Mr. Allen s succession-houses worked?\" describing the nature\nof his own as they entered them.\n\n\"Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use\nof for her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.\"\n\n\"He is a happy man!\" said the general, with a look of very happy\ncontempt.\n\nHaving taken her into every division, and led her under every wall,\ntill she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he suffered the\ngirls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then\nexpressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations\nabout the tea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their\nwalk, if Miss Morland were not tired. \"But where are you going,\nEleanor? Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland\nwill get wet. Our best way is across the park.\"\n\n\"This is so favourite a walk of mine,\" said Miss Tilney, \"that I always\nthink it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.\"\n\nIt was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs;\nand Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it,\ncould not, even by the general s disapprobation, be kept from stepping\nforward. He perceived her inclination, and having again urged the plea\nof health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition. He\nexcused himself, however, from attending them: \"The rays of the sun\nwere not too cheerful for him, and he would meet them by another\ncourse.\" He turned away; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her\nspirits were relieved by the separation. The shock, however, being less\nreal than the relief, offered it no injury; and she began to talk with\neasy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.\n\n\"I am particularly fond of this spot,\" said her companion, with a sigh.\n\"It was my mother s favourite walk.\"\n\nCatherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before,\nand the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself\ndirectly in her altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with\nwhich she waited for something more.\n\n\"I used to walk here so often with her!\" added Eleanor; \"though I never\nloved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to\nwonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now.\"\n\n\"And ought it not,\" reflected Catherine, \"to endear it to her husband?\nYet the general would not enter it.\" Miss Tilney continuing silent, she\nventured to say, \"Her death must have been a great affliction!\"\n\n\"A great and increasing one,\" replied the other, in a low voice. \"I was\nonly thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as\nstrongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then\nknow what a loss it was.\" She stopped for a moment, and then added,\nwith great firmness, \"I have no sister, you know and though\nHenry though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great\ndeal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to\nbe often solitary.\"\n\n\"To be sure you must miss him very much.\"\n\n\"A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a\nconstant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other.\"\n\n\"Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any picture\nof her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was\nit from dejection of spirits?\" were questions now eagerly poured forth;\nthe first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were\npassed by; and Catherine s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney\naugmented with every question, whether answered or not. Of her\nunhappiness in marriage, she felt persuaded. The general certainly had\nbeen an unkind husband. He did not love her walk: could he therefore\nhave loved her? And besides, handsome as he was, there was a something\nin the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to\nher.\n\n\"Her picture, I suppose,\" blushing at the consummate art of her own\nquestion, \"hangs in your father s room?\"\n\n\"No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was\ndissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place. Soon\nafter her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my\nbed-chamber where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.\"\nHere was another proof. A portrait very like of a departed wife, not\nvalued by the husband! He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!\n\nCatherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the\nfeelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously\nexcited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute\naversion. Yes, aversion! His cruelty to such a charming woman made him\nodious to her. She had often read of such characters, characters which\nMr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was\nproof positive of the contrary.\n\nShe had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them\ndirectly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous\nindignation, she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen\nto him, and even to smile when he smiled. Being no longer able,\nhowever, to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon\nbegan to walk with lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a\nconcern for her health, which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of\nhim, was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house. He\nwould follow them in a quarter of an hour. Again they parted but\nEleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge\nagainst taking her friend round the abbey till his return. This second\ninstance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck\nCatherine as very remarkable.\n\n",

It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one. Did Henry s income depend solely on this living, he would not be ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing. Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his profession."

        "raw text": " 23\n\n\nAn hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of\nhis young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character.\n\"This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind\nat ease, or a conscience void of reproach.\" At length he appeared; and,\nwhatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could still\nsmile with _them_. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend s\ncuriosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father\nbeing, contrary to Catherine s expectations, unprovided with any\npretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to\norder refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready\nto escort them.\n\nThey set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step, which\ncaught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read\nCatherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common\ndrawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both\nin size and furniture the real drawing-room, used only with company of\nconsequence. It was very noble very grand very charming! was all that\nCatherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned\nthe colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that\nhad much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or\nelegance of any room s fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared\nfor no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When\nthe general had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of\nevery well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an\napartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection\nof books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride.\nCatherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than\nbefore gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge,\nby running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed.\nBut suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as\nwas the building, she had already visited the greatest part; though, on\nbeing told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven\nrooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could\nscarcely believe it, or overcome the suspicion of there being many\nchambers secreted. It was some relief, however, that they were to\nreturn to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less\nimportance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages,\nnot wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and she was\nfurther soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading\nwhat had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and\nobserving several doors that were neither opened nor explained to\nher by finding herself successively in a billiard-room, and in the\ngeneral s private apartment, without comprehending their connection, or\nbeing able to turn aright when she left them; and lastly, by passing\nthrough a dark little room, owning Henry s authority, and strewed with\nhis litter of books, guns, and greatcoats.\n\nFrom the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be\nseen at five o clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of\npacing out the length, for the more certain information of Miss\nMorland, as to what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded\nby quick communication to the kitchen the ancient kitchen of the\nconvent, rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the\nstoves and hot closets of the present. The general s improving hand had\nnot loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of\nthe cooks had been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and,\nwhen the genius of others had failed, his own had often produced the\nperfection wanted. His endowments of this spot alone might at any time\nhave placed him high among the benefactors of the convent.\n\nWith the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the\nfourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state,\nbeen removed by the general s father, and the present erected in its\nplace. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not\nonly new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and\nenclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been\nthought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had\nswept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for\nthe purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been\nspared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the\ngeneral allowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement\nof his offices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss\nMorland s, a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the\nlabours of her inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he\nshould make no apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of\nall; and Catherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their\nmultiplicity and their convenience. The purposes for which a few\nshapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at\nFullerton, were here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious\nand roomy. The number of servants continually appearing did not strike\nher less than the number of their offices. Wherever they went, some\npattened girl stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked\noff. Yet this was an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these\ndomestic arrangements from such as she had read about from abbeys and\ncastles, in which, though certainly larger than Northanger, all the\ndirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at\nthe utmost. How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs.\nAllen; and, when Catherine saw what was necessary here, she began to be\namazed herself.\n\nThey returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended,\nand the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be\npointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite\ndirection from the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered\none on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She was here\nshown successively into three large bed-chambers, with their\ndressing-rooms, most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything\nthat money and taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to\napartments, had been bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the\nlast five years, they were perfect in all that would be generally\npleasing, and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine. As\nthey were surveying the last, the general, after slightly naming a few\nof the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been\nhonoured, turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine, and ventured\nto hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be \"our\nfriends from Fullerton.\" She felt the unexpected compliment, and deeply\nregretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly\ndisposed towards herself, and so full of civility to all her family.\n\nThe gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney,\nadvancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point\nof doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach\nof gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and,\nas Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she were\ngoing? And what was there more to be seen? Had not Miss Morland already\nseen all that could be worth her notice? And did she not suppose her\nfriend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise? Miss\nTilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the\nmortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond\nthem, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a\nwinding staircase, believed herself at last within the reach of\nsomething worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced back the\ngallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the\nhouse than see all the finery of all the rest. The general s evident\ndesire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant.\nSomething was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though it had\ntrespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here; and what\nthat something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney s, as they followed\nthe general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out: \"I was\ngoing to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she\ndied \" were all her words; but few as they were, they conveyed pages of\nintelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the general should\nshrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room\nin all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had\npassed, which released his suffering wife, and left him to the stings\nof conscience.\n\nShe ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of\nbeing permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the\nhouse; and Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should\nhave a convenient hour. Catherine understood her: the general must be\nwatched from home, before that room could be entered. \"It remains as it\nwas, I suppose?\" said she, in a tone of feeling.\n\n\"Yes, entirely.\"\n\n\"And how long ago may it be that your mother died?\"\n\n\"She has been dead these nine years.\" And nine years, Catherine knew,\nwas a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the\ndeath of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights.\n\n\"You were with her, I suppose, to the last?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Miss Tilney, sighing; \"I was unfortunately from home. Her\nillness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.\"\n\nCatherine s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally\nsprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry s father ?\nAnd yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest\nsuspicions! And, when she saw him in the evening, while she worked with\nher friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in\nsilent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she felt\nsecure from all possibility of wronging him. It was the air and\nattitude of a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy\nworkings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its\nfearful review of past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the\nanxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so\nrepeatedly, as to catch Miss Tilney s notice. \"My father,\" she\nwhispered, \"often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing\nunusual.\"\n\n\"So much the worse!\" thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of\na piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and\nboded nothing good.\n\nAfter an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made\nher peculiarly sensible of Henry s importance among them, she was\nheartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general\nnot designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell.\nWhen the butler would have lit his master s candle, however, he was\nforbidden. The latter was not going to retire. \"I have many pamphlets\nto finish,\" said he to Catherine, \"before I can close my eyes, and\nperhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after\nyou are asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? _My_ eyes\nwill be blinding for the good of others, and _yours_ preparing by rest\nfor future mischief.\"\n\nBut neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could\nwin Catherine from thinking that some very different object must\noccasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours,\nafter the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.\nThere must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could\nbe done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs.\nTilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the\npitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the\nconclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, it was\nat least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural\ncourse of things, she must ere long be released. The suddenness of her\nreputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other\nchildren, at the time all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment.\nIts origin jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty was yet to be\nunravelled.\n\nIn revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her\nas not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very\nspot of this unfortunate woman s confinement might have been within a\nfew paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what\npart of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which\nyet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage,\npaved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, she\nwell remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. To\nwhat might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this\nconjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in\nwhich lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as\ncertainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected\nrange of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of\nwhich she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some secret\nmeans with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous\nproceedings of her husband. Down that staircase she had perhaps been\nconveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!\n\nCatherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and\nsometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were\nsupported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.\n\nThe side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to\nbe acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it\nstruck her that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the\ngeneral s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to\nthe prison of his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she\nstole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery,\nto see if it appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too\nearly. The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants\nmust still be up. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to\nwatch; but then, when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet,\nshe would, if not quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once\nmore. The clock struck twelve and Catherine had been half an hour\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 24\n\n\nThe next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of\nthe mysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between\nmorning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise\nabroad or eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine s\ncuriosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after\ndinner, either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven\no clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a\ntreacherous lamp. The day was unmarked therefore by anything to\ninterest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to\nthe memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By\nthat her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of\nthe highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her\nby the inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other\nher destroyer, affected her even to tears.\n\nThat the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to\nface it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so\nboldly collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so\nfearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed\nwonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings\nequally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She could remember\ndozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime\nto crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of\nhumanity or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement\nclosed their black career. The erection of the monument itself could\nnot in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney s actual\ndecease. Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes\nwere supposed to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they\nwere said to be enclosed what could it avail in such a case? Catherine\nhad read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a\nwaxen figure might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried\non.\n\nThe succeeding morning promised something better. The general s early\nwalk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and\nwhen she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to Miss\nTilney the accomplishment of her promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige\nher; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, their\nfirst visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber. It\nrepresented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,\njustifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were\nnot in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting\nwith features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,\nthe very image, if not of Henry s, of Eleanor s the only portraits of\nwhich she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal\nresemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for\ngenerations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study\nfor a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this\ndrawback, with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest,\nwould have left it unwillingly.\n\nHer agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any\nendeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. Eleanor s\ncountenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her\ninured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again\nshe passed through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the\nimportant lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to\nclose the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded\nfigure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery, stood\nbefore her! The name of \"Eleanor\" at the same moment, in his loudest\ntone, resounded through the building, giving to his daughter the first\nintimation of his presence, and to Catherine terror upon terror. An\nattempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on\nperceiving him, yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye;\nand when her friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by\nher, had joined and disappeared with him, she ran for safety to her own\nroom, and, locking herself in, believed that she should never have\ncourage to go down again. She remained there at least an hour, in the\ngreatest agitation, deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend,\nand expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in\nhis own apartment. No summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing\na carriage drive up to the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and\nmeet him under the protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay\nwith company; and she was named to them by the general as the friend of\nhis daughter, in a complimentary style, which so well concealed his\nresentful ire, as to make her feel secure at least of life for the\npresent. And Eleanor, with a command of countenance which did honour to\nher concern for his character, taking an early occasion of saying to\nher, \"My father only wanted me to answer a note,\" she began to hope\nthat she had either been unseen by the general, or that from some\nconsideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so.\nUpon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence, after the\ncompany left them, and nothing occurred to disturb it.\n\nIn the course of this morning s reflections, she came to a resolution\nof making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be\nmuch better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the\nmatter. To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court\nher into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the\noffice of a friend. The general s utmost anger could not be to herself\nwhat it might be to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the\nexamination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any\ncompanion. It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions,\nfrom which the other had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily\nexempt; nor could she therefore, in _her_ presence, search for those\nproofs of the general s cruelty, which however they might yet have\nescaped discovery, she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth, in\nthe shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the last gasp. Of\nthe way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress; and as she\nwished to get it over before Henry s return, who was expected on the\nmorrow, there was no time to be lost. The day was bright, her courage\nhigh; at four o clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon, and\nit would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual.\n\nIt was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before\nthe clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she\nhurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding\ndoors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the\none in question. The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no\nsullen sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the\nroom was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance\nanother step. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every\nfeature. She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome\ndimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid s care, a bright\nBath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the\nwarm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows!\nCatherine had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they\nwere. Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly\nsucceeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She\ncould not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in\neverything else! in Miss Tilney s meaning, in her own calculation! This\napartment, to which she had given a date so ancient, a position so\nawful, proved to be one end of what the general s father had built.\nThere were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into\ndressing-closets; but she had no inclination to open either. Would the\nveil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she\nhad last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?\nNo: whatever might have been the general s crimes, he had certainly too\nmuch wit to let them sue for detection. She was sick of exploring, and\ndesired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy\nto its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she\nhad entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where,\nmade her pause and tremble. To be found there, even by a servant, would\nbe unpleasant; but by the general (and he seemed always at hand when\nleast wanted), much worse! She listened the sound had ceased; and\nresolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door.\nAt that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed\nwith swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet\nto pass before she could gain the gallery. She had no power to move.\nWith a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the\nstaircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view. \"Mr.\nTilney!\" she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment. He\nlooked astonished too. \"Good God!\" she continued, not attending to his\naddress. \"How came you here? How came you up that staircase?\"\n\n\"How came I up that staircase!\" he replied, greatly surprised. \"Because\nit is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why\nshould I not come up it?\"\n\nCatherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more.\nHe seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which\nher lips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. \"And may I\nnot, in my turn,\" said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, \"ask\nhow _you_ came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road\nfrom the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be\nfrom the stables to mine.\"\n\n\"I have been,\" said Catherine, looking down, \"to see your mother s\nroom.\"\n\n\"My mother s room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?\"\n\n\"No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but\nthree hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You\nlook pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those\nstairs. Perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading\nfrom the offices in common use?\"\n\n\"No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride.\"\n\n\"Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms\nin the house by yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday and we were\ncoming here to these rooms but only\" dropping her voice \"your father\nwas with us.\"\n\n\"And that prevented you,\" said Henry, earnestly regarding her. \"Have\nyou looked into all the rooms in that passage?\"\n\n\"No, I only wanted to see Is not it very late? I must go and dress.\"\n\n\"It is only a quarter past four\" showing his watch \"and you are not now\nin Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at\nNorthanger must be enough.\"\n\nShe could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be\ndetained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the first\ntime in their acquaintance, wish to leave him. They walked slowly up\nthe gallery. \"Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?\"\n\n\"No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to\nwrite directly.\"\n\n\"Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have\nheard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise the fidelity of\npromising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can\ndeceive and pain you. My mother s room is very commodious, is it not?\nLarge and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!\nIt always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house,\nand I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She\nsent you to look at it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It has been your own doing entirely?\" Catherine said nothing. After a\nshort silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, \"As\nthere is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must\nhave proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character,\nas described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I\nbelieve, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can\nboast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a\nperson never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating\ntenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,\nhas talked of her a great deal?\"\n\n\"Yes, a great deal. That is no, not much, but what she did say was very\ninteresting. Her dying so suddenly\" (slowly, and with hesitation it was\nspoken), \"and you none of you being at home and your father, I\nthought perhaps had not been very fond of her.\"\n\n\"And from these circumstances,\" he replied (his quick eye fixed on\nhers), \"you infer perhaps the probability of some\nnegligence some\" (involuntarily she shook her head) \"or it may be of\nsomething still less pardonable.\" She raised her eyes towards him more\nfully than she had ever done before. \"My mother s illness,\" he\ncontinued, \"the seizure which ended in her death, _was_ sudden. The\nmalady itself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious\nfever its cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short,\nas soon as she could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very\nrespectable man, and one in whom she had always placed great\nconfidence. Upon his opinion of her danger, two others were called in\nthe next day, and remained in almost constant attendance for four and\ntwenty hours. On the fifth day she died. During the progress of her\ndisorder, Frederick and I (_we_ were both at home) saw her repeatedly;\nand from our own observation can bear witness to her having received\nevery possible attention which could spring from the affection of those\nabout her, or which her situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor\nwas absent, and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother\nin her coffin.\"\n\n\"But your father,\" said Catherine, \"was _he_ afflicted?\"\n\n\"For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attached\nto her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for\nhim to we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of\ndisposition and I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she\nmight not often have had much to bear, but though his temper injured\nher, his judgment never did. His value of her was sincere; and, if not\npermanently, he was truly afflicted by her death.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of it,\" said Catherine; \"it would have been very\nshocking!\"\n\n\"If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror\nas I have hardly words to Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful\nnature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been\njudging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live.\nRemember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own\nunderstanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of\nwhat is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such\natrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated\nwithout being known, in a country like this, where social and literary\nintercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a\nneighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay\neverything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been\nadmitting?\"\n\nThey had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she\nran off to her own room.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 25\n\n\nThe visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened.\nHenry s address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her\neyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several\ndisappointments had done. Most grievously was she humbled. Most\nbitterly did she cry. It was not only with herself that she was\nsunk but with Henry. Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all\nexposed to him, and he must despise her forever. The liberty which her\nimagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he\never forgive it? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could\nthey ever be forgotten? She hated herself more than she could express.\nHe had she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning,\nshown something like affection for her. But now in short, she made\nherself as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when\nthe clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an\nintelligible answer to Eleanor s inquiry if she was well. The\nformidable Henry soon followed her into the room, and the only\ndifference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more\nattention than usual. Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he\nlooked as if he was aware of it.\n\nThe evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness;\nand her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She did\nnot learn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope\nthat it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her\nHenry s entire regard. Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what\nshe had with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly\nbe clearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created\ndelusion, each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an\nimagination resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one\npurpose by a mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving\nto be frightened. She remembered with what feelings she had prepared\nfor a knowledge of Northanger. She saw that the infatuation had been\ncreated, the mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it\nseemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of\nreading which she had there indulged.\n\nCharming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe s works, and charming even as were\nthe works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human\nnature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked\nfor. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,\nthey might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and the\nsouth of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there\nrepresented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and even\nof that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western\nextremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some\nsecurity for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of\nthe land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated,\nservants were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be\nprocured, like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and\nPyrenees, perhaps, there were no mixed characters. There, such as were\nnot as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But\nin England it was not so; among the English, she believed, in their\nhearts and habits, there was a general though unequal mixture of good\nand bad. Upon this conviction, she would not be surprised if even in\nHenry and Eleanor Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter\nappear; and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some\nactual specks in the character of their father, who, though cleared\nfrom the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have\nentertained, she did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not\nperfectly amiable.\n\nHer mind made up on these several points, and her resolution formed, of\nalways judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she\nhad nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and\nthe lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in\nthe course of another day. Henry s astonishing generosity and nobleness\nof conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,\nwas of the greatest assistance to her; and sooner than she could have\nsupposed it possible in the beginning of her distress, her spirits\nbecame absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual\nimprovement by anything he said. There were still some subjects,\nindeed, under which she believed they must always tremble the mention\nof a chest or a cabinet, for instance and she did not love the sight of\njapan in any shape: but even _she_ could allow that an occasional\nmemento of past folly, however painful, might not be without use.\n\nThe anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of\nromance. Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater.\nShe was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the\nrooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured of\nIsabella s having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she had\nleft her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James.\nHer only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James\nhad protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and\nMrs. Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to\nFullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she\npromised a thing, she was so scrupulous in performing it! This made it\nso particularly strange!\n\nFor nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition of\na disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on the\ntenth, when she entered the breakfast-room, her first object was a\nletter, held out by Henry s willing hand. She thanked him as heartily\nas if he had written it himself. \" Tis only from James, however,\" as\nshe looked at the direction. She opened it; it was from Oxford; and to\nthis purpose:\n\n\"Dear Catherine,\n    \"Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it\n    my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss\n    Thorpe and me. I left her and Bath yesterday, never to see either\n    again. I shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you\n    more. You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where\n    lies the blame; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything\n    but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned. Thank\n    God! I am undeceived in time! But it is a heavy blow! After my\n    father s consent had been so kindly given but no more of this. She\n    has made me miserable forever! Let me soon hear from you, dear\n    Catherine; you are my only friend; _your_ love I do build upon. I\n    wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney\n    makes his engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably\n    circumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him;\n    his honest heart would feel so much. I have written to him and my\n    father. Her duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last,\n    if I reasoned with her, she declared herself as much attached to me\n    as ever, and laughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I\n    bore with it; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved,\n    I was that man. I cannot understand even now what she would be at,\n    for there could be no need of my being played off to make her\n    secure of Tilney. We parted at last by mutual consent happy for me\n    had we never met! I can never expect to know such another woman!\n    Dearest Catherine, beware how you give your heart.\n\n\n\"Believe me,\" &c.\n\n\nCatherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of\ncountenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her\nto be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her\nthrough the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it\nbegan. He was prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his\nfather s entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could\nhardly eat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her\ncheeks as she sat. The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her\nlap, and then in her pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she\ndid. The general, between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no\nleisure for noticing her; but to the other two her distress was equally\nvisible. As soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her\nown room; but the housemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to\ncome down again. She turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but\nHenry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither, and were at that\nmoment deep in consultation about her. She drew back, trying to beg\ntheir pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the\nothers withdrew, after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of\nbeing of use or comfort to her.\n\nAfter half an hour s free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine\nfelt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make her\ndistress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if\nparticularly questioned, she might just give an idea just distantly\nhint at it but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella\nhad been to her and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!\nShe believed she must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor\nwere by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it,\nlooked at her anxiously. Catherine took her place at the table, and,\nafter a short silence, Eleanor said, \"No bad news from Fullerton, I\nhope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland your brothers and sisters I hope they are\nnone of them ill?\"\n\n\"No, I thank you\" (sighing as she spoke); \"they are all very well. My\nletter was from my brother at Oxford.\"\n\nNothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through\nher tears, she added, \"I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter\nagain!\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Henry, closing the book he had just opened; \"if I\nhad suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should\nhave given it with very different feelings.\"\n\n\"It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James is\nso unhappy! You will soon know why.\"\n\n\"To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,\" replied Henry\nwarmly, \"must be a comfort to him under any distress.\"\n\n\"I have one favour to beg,\" said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an\nagitated manner, \"that, if your brother should be coming here, you will\ngive me notice of it, that I may go away.\"\n\n\"Our brother! Frederick!\"\n\n\"Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but\nsomething has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in\nthe same house with Captain Tilney.\"\n\nEleanor s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing\nastonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in\nwhich Miss Thorpe s name was included, passed his lips.\n\n\"How quick you are!\" cried Catherine: \"you have guessed it, I declare!\nAnd yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its\nending so. Isabella no wonder _now_ I have not heard from her Isabella\nhas deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed\nthere had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is\nbad in the world?\"\n\n\"I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope he\nhas not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland s\ndisappointment. His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you\nmust be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland sorry that\nanyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at\nFrederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story.\"\n\n\"It is very true, however; you shall read James s letter yourself.\nStay There is one part \" recollecting with a blush the last line.\n\n\"Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern\nmy brother?\"\n\n\"No, read it yourself,\" cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were\nclearer. \"I do not know what I was thinking of\" (blushing again that\nshe had blushed before); \"James only means to give me good advice.\"\n\nHe gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with close\nattention, returned it saying, \"Well, if it is to be so, I can only say\nthat I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who has\nchosen a wife with less sense than his family expected. I do not envy\nhis situation, either as a lover or a son.\"\n\nMiss Tilney, at Catherine s invitation, now read the letter likewise,\nand, having expressed also her concern and surprise, began to inquire\ninto Miss Thorpe s connections and fortune.\n\n\"Her mother is a very good sort of woman,\" was Catherine s answer.\n\n\"What was her father?\"\n\n\"A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.\"\n\n\"Are they a wealthy family?\"\n\n\"No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but\nthat will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal!\nHe told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to\npromote the happiness of his children.\" The brother and sister looked\nat each other. \"But,\" said Eleanor, after a short pause, \"would it be\nto promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must\nbe an unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so. And\nhow strange an infatuation on Frederick s side! A girl who, before his\neyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another\nman! Is not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his\nheart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!\"\n\n\"That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption\nagainst him. When I think of his past declarations, I give him up.\nMoreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe s prudence to\nsuppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was\nsecured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He is a deceased\nman defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor,\nand such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless,\nguileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,\nand knowing no disguise.\"\n\n\"Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,\" said Eleanor with a\nsmile.\n\n\"But perhaps,\" observed Catherine, \"though she has behaved so ill by\nour family, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the\nman she likes, she may be constant.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am afraid she will,\" replied Henry; \"I am afraid she will be\nvery constant, unless a baronet should come in her way; that is\nFrederick s only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the\narrivals.\"\n\n\"You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are\nsome things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she\nfirst knew what my father would do for them, she seemed quite\ndisappointed that it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone s\ncharacter in my life before.\"\n\n\"Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.\"\n\n\"My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poor\nJames, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.\"\n\n\"Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we\nmust not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You\nfeel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you\nfeel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is\nbecoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to\nshare at Bath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent. You\nwould not, for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that\nyou have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on\nwhose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any\ndifficulty, you could rely on. You feel all this?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Catherine, after a few moments  reflection, \"I do not ought\nI? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still\nlove her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her\nagain, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have\nthought.\"\n\n\"You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human\nnature. Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know\nthemselves.\"\n\nCatherine, by some chance or other, found her spirits so very much\nrelieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led\non, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had\nproduced it.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 26\n\n\nFrom this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young\npeople; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young\nfriends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella s want of\nconsequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the\nway of her marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general\nwould, upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might\nbe raised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her\nfeelings moreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as\ninsignificant, and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir\nof the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself,\nat what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to\nrest? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only\nbe dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular\npartiality, which, as she was given to understand by his words as well\nas his actions, she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite\nin the general; and by a recollection of some most generous and\ndisinterested sentiments on the subject of money, which she had more\nthan once heard him utter, and which tempted her to think his\ndisposition in such matters misunderstood by his children.\n\nThey were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not\nhave the courage to apply in person for his father s consent, and so\nrepeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely\nto come to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her\nmind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her\nown. But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he\nmade his application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella s\nconduct, it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay\nthe whole business before him as it really was, enabling the general by\nthat means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his\nobjections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations. She\nproposed it to him accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so\neagerly as she had expected. \"No,\" said he, \"my father s hands need not\nbe strengthened, and Frederick s confession of folly need not be\nforestalled. He must tell his own story.\"\n\n\"But he will tell only half of it.\"\n\n\"A quarter would be enough.\"\n\nA day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. His\nbrother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to\nthem as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected\nengagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it. The\ngeneral, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick s\nremissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and\nhad no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland s time\nat Northanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on\nthis head, feared the sameness of every day s society and employments\nwould disgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in\nthe country, talked every now and then of having a large party to\ndinner, and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young\ndancing people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time\nof year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the\ncountry. And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning\nthat when he next went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise\nthere some day or other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was\ngreatly honoured and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with\nthe scheme. \"And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this\npleasure? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting,\nand shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.\"\n\n\"Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There is\nno need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way.\nWhatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I\ncan answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s\ntable. Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come\non Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor\nfrom Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot\nin decency fail attending the club. I really could not face my\nacquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the\ncountry, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me,\nMiss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small\nsacrifice of time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very\nworthy men. They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I\ndine with them whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of\nthe question. But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and\nwe shall be with you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two\nhours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall\nbe in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday,\nyou may look for us.\"\n\nA ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this\nlittle excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted with\nWoodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about\nan hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she\nand Eleanor were sitting, and said, \"I am come, young ladies, in a very\nmoralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are\nalways to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great\ndisadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the\nfuture, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour.\nBecause I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on\nWednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I\nmust go away directly, two days before I intended it.\"\n\n\"Go away!\" said Catherine, with a very long face. \"And why?\"\n\n\"Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in\nfrightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go and\nprepare a dinner for you, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Oh! Not seriously!\"\n\n\"Aye, and sadly too for I had much rather stay.\"\n\n\"But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said?\nWhen he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble,\nbecause _anything_ would do.\"\n\nHenry only smiled. \"I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your\nsister s account and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general\nmade such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if\nhe had not said half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent\ndinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could\nnot signify.\"\n\n\"I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own. Good-bye. As\ntomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.\"\n\nHe went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to\nCatherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry s, she was very soon\nobliged to give him credit for being right, however disagreeable to her\nhis going. But the inexplicability of the general s conduct dwelt much\non her thoughts. That he was very particular in his eating, she had, by\nher own unassisted observation, already discovered; but why he should\nsay one thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most\nunaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who but\nHenry could have been aware of what his father was at?\n\nFrom Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry.\nThis was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney s\nletter would certainly come in his absence; and Wednesday she was very\nsure would be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in\ngloom. Her brother so unhappy, and her loss in Isabella so great; and\nEleanor s spirits always affected by Henry s absence! What was there to\ninterest or amuse her? She was tired of the woods and the\nshrubberies always so smooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no\nmore to her now than any other house. The painful remembrance of the\nfolly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which\ncould spring from a consideration of the building. What a revolution in\nher ideas! She, who had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was\nnothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a\nwell-connected parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better:\nFullerton had its faults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday\nshould ever come!\n\nIt did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. It\ncame it was fine and Catherine trod on air. By ten o clock, the chaise\nand four conveyed the trio from the abbey; and, after an agreeable\ndrive of almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and\npopulous village, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed\nto say how pretty she thought it, as the general seemed to think an\napology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the\nvillage; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever\nbeen at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the\nrank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler s shops which they\npassed. At the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged\nfrom the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone\nhouse, with its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove\nup to the door, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large\nNewfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and\nmake much of them.\n\nCatherine s mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her either\nto observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general\nfor her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which\nshe was sitting. Upon looking round it then, she perceived in a moment\nthat it was the most comfortable room in the world; but she was too\nguarded to say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him.\n\n\"We are not calling it a good house,\" said he. \"We are not comparing it\nwith Fullerton and Northanger we are considering it as a mere\nparsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and\nhabitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other\nwords, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so\ngood. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say\notherwise; and anything in reason a bow thrown out, perhaps though,\nbetween ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion,\nit is a patched-on bow.\"\n\nCatherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained\nby it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and\nsupported by Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments\nwas introduced by his servant, the general was shortly restored to his\ncomplacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits.\n\nThe room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and\nhandsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it to\nwalk round the grounds, she was shown, first into a smaller apartment,\nbelonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually\ntidy on the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the\ndrawing-room, with the appearance of which, though unfurnished,\nCatherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a\nprettily shaped room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view\nfrom them pleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed\nher admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which\nshe felt it. \"Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a\npity not to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it\nis the prettiest room in the world!\"\n\n\"I trust,\" said the general, with a most satisfied smile, \"that it will\nvery speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady s taste!\"\n\n\"Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a\nsweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees, too! It is\nthe prettiest cottage!\"\n\n\"You like it you approve it as an object it is enough. Henry, remember\nthat Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.\"\n\nSuch a compliment recalled all Catherine s consciousness, and silenced\nher directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her\nchoice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like\nan opinion on the subject could be drawn from her. The influence of\nfresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating\nthese embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental\npart of the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow,\non which Henry s genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she was\nsufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground\nshe had ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher\nthan the green bench in the corner.\n\nA saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a\nvisit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game\nof play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them\nto four o clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. At\nfour they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never\nhad any day passed so quickly!\n\nShe could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem\nto create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he was\neven looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. His\nson and daughter s observations were of a different kind. They had\nseldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and never\nbefore known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter s being\noiled.\n\nAt six o clock, the general having taken his coffee, the carriage again\nreceived them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct\nthroughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subject\nof his expectations, that, could she have felt equally confident of the\nwishes of his son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little\nanxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 27\n\n\nThe next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from\nIsabella:\n\n_Bath, April_\n\n\nMy dearest Catherine,\n    I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and\n    have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner. I\n    really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place\n    one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to\n    begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but\n    have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray\n    write to me soon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave\n    this vile place tomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no\n    pleasure in it the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares\n    for is gone. I believe if I could see you I should not mind the\n    rest, for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive. I am\n    quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having heard from him\n    since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of some misunderstanding.\n    Your kind offices will set all right: he is the only man I ever did\n    or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it. The spring\n    fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can\n    imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you\n    never think of me. I will not say all that I could of the family\n    you are with, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against\n    those you esteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust,\n    and young men never know their minds two days together. I rejoice\n    to say that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly\n    abhor, has left Bath. You will know, from this description, I must\n    mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may remember, was amazingly\n    disposed to follow and tease me, before you went away. Afterwards\n    he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many girls might have\n    been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I knew the\n    fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days ago, and\n    I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is the greatest\n    coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days\n    he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste,\n    but took no notice of him. The last time we met was in Bath Street,\n    and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I\n    would not even look at him. He went into the pump-room afterwards;\n    but I would not have followed him for all the world. Such a\n    contrast between him and your brother! Pray send me some news of\n    the latter I am quite unhappy about him; he seemed so uncomfortable\n    when he went away, with a cold, or something that affected his\n    spirits. I would write to him myself, but have mislaid his\n    direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he took something in\n    my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his satisfaction; or,\n    if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself to me, or a\n    call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights. I have\n    not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in\n    last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they\n    teased me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut\n    myself up because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the\n    Mitchells, and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out.\n    I knew their spite: at one time they could not be civil to me, but\n    now they are all friendship; but I am not such a fool as to be\n    taken in by them. You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own.\n    Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine, as I wore it\n    the week before at the concert, but made wretched work of it it\n    happened to become my odd face, I believe, at least Tilney told me\n    so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but he is the last\n    man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple now: I know\n    I look hideous in it, but no matter it is your dear brother s\n    favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in\n    writing to him and to me,\n\n\nWho ever am, etc.\n\n\nSuch a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine.\nIts inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the\nvery first. She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever\nloved her. Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her\nexcuses were empty, and her demands impudent. \"Write to James on her\nbehalf! No, James should never hear Isabella s name mentioned by her\nagain.\"\n\nOn Henry s arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanor\ntheir brother s safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and\nreading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong\nindignation. When she had finished it \"So much for Isabella,\" she\ncried, \"and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or she\ncould not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her\ncharacter better known to me than mine is to her. I see what she has\nbeen about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. I\ndo not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and\nI wish I had never known her.\"\n\n\"It will soon be as if you never had,\" said Henry.\n\n\"There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that she has\nhad designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not\nunderstand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should\nhe pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and\nthen fly off himself?\"\n\n\"I have very little to say for Frederick s motives, such as I believe\nthem to have been. He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the\nchief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yet\ninjured himself. If the _effect_ of his behaviour does not justify him\nwith you, we had better not seek after the cause.\"\n\n\"Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her?\"\n\n\"I am persuaded that he never did.\"\n\n\"And only made believe to do so for mischief s sake?\"\n\nHenry bowed his assent.\n\n\"Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all. Though it has\nturned out so well for us, I do not like him at all. As it happens,\nthere is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any\nheart to lose. But, suppose he had made her very much in love with\nhim?\"\n\n\"But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to\nlose consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that\ncase, she would have met with very different treatment.\"\n\n\"It is very right that you should stand by your brother.\"\n\n\"And if you would stand by _yours_, you would not be much distressed by\nthe disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate\nprinciple of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the\ncool reasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.\"\n\nCatherine was complimented out of further bitterness. Frederick could\nnot be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made himself so agreeable. She\nresolved on not answering Isabella s letter, and tried to think no more\nof it.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 28\n\n\nSoon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London for\na week; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity\nshould rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland s company, and\nanxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his\nchildren as their chief object in his absence. His departure gave\nCatherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be\nsometimes a gain. The happiness with which their time now passed, every\nemployment voluntary, every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease\nand good humour, walking where they liked and when they liked, their\nhours, pleasures, and fatigues at their own command, made her\nthoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general s presence had\nimposed, and most thankfully feel their present release from it. Such\nease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and\nmore every day; and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming\nexpedient to leave the one, and an apprehension of not being equally\nbeloved by the other, she would at each moment of each day have been\nperfectly happy; but she was now in the fourth week of her visit;\nbefore the general came home, the fourth week would be turned, and\nperhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer. This was\na painful consideration whenever it occurred; and eager to get rid of\nsuch a weight on her mind, she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor\nabout it at once, propose going away, and be guided in her conduct by\nthe manner in which her proposal might be taken.\n\nAware that if she gave herself much time, she might feel it difficult\nto bring forward so unpleasant a subject, she took the first\nopportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor s\nbeing in the middle of a speech about something very different, to\nstart forth her obligation of going away very soon. Eleanor looked and\ndeclared herself much concerned. She had \"hoped for the pleasure of her\ncompany for a much longer time had been misled (perhaps by her wishes)\nto suppose that a much longer visit had been promised and could not but\nthink that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to\nher to have her there, they would be too generous to hasten her\nreturn.\" Catherine explained: \"Oh! As to _that_, Papa and Mamma were in\nno hurry at all. As long as she was happy, they would always be\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?\"\n\n\"Oh! Because she had been there so long.\"\n\n\"Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If you\nthink it long \"\n\n\"Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as\nlong again.\" And it was directly settled that, till she had, her\nleaving them was not even to be thought of. In having this cause of\nuneasiness so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise\nweakened. The kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor s manner in pressing\nher to stay, and Henry s gratified look on being told that her stay was\ndetermined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left\nher only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do\ncomfortably without. She did almost always believe that Henry loved\nher, and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished\nher to belong to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties\nwere merely sportive irritations.\n\nHenry was not able to obey his father s injunction of remaining wholly\nat Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his absence in\nLondon, the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave\nthem on Saturday for a couple of nights. His loss was not now what it\nhad been while the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but\ndid not ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation,\nand improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the\ntime to themselves, that it was eleven o clock, rather a late hour at\nthe abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry s\ndeparture. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,\nas far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a\ncarriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the\nidea by the loud noise of the house-bell. After the first perturbation\nof surprise had passed away, in a \"Good heaven! What can be the\nmatter?\" it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother,\nwhose arrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and\naccordingly she hurried down to welcome him.\n\nCatherine walked on to her chamber, making up her mind as well as she\ncould, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comforting\nherself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her, and\nthe persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of\nher, that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as\nwould make their meeting materially painful. She trusted he would never\nspeak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed of\nthe part he had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as\nall mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she thought she could behave\nto him very civilly. In such considerations time passed away, and it\nwas certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him,\nand have so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his\narrival, and Eleanor did not come up.\n\nAt that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery, and\nlistened for its continuance; but all was silent. Scarcely, however,\nhad she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something\nmoving close to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was\ntouching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the\nlock proved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the\nidea of anyone s approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be\nagain overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised\nimagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,\nand only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine s spirits, however, were\ntranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor s cheeks were pale, and\nher manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it\nseemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when\nthere. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney s\naccount, could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged\nher to be seated, rubbed her temples with lavender-water, and hung over\nher with affectionate solicitude. \"My dear Catherine, you must not you\nmust not indeed \" were Eleanor s first connected words. \"I am quite\nwell. This kindness distracts me I cannot bear it I come to you on such\nan errand!\"\n\n\"Errand! To me!\"\n\n\"How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!\"\n\nA new idea now darted into Catherine s mind, and turning as pale as her\nfriend, she exclaimed, \" Tis a messenger from Woodston!\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, indeed,\" returned Eleanor, looking at her most\ncompassionately; \"it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself.\"\nHer voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as she\nmentioned his name. His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to\nmake Catherine s heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed\nthere were anything worse to be told. She said nothing; and Eleanor,\nendeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes\nstill cast down, soon went on. \"You are too good, I am sure, to think\nthe worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a\nmost unwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately\nbeen settled between us how joyfully, how thankfully on my side! as to\nyour continuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I\ntell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the\nhappiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by But I\nmust not trust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are to part. My\nfather has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away\non Monday. We are going to Lord Longtown s, near Hereford, for a\nfortnight. Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot\nattempt either.\"\n\n\"My dear Eleanor,\" cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well as\nshe could, \"do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give way\nto a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part so soon, and so\nsuddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my\nvisit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Can\nyou, when you return from this lord s, come to Fullerton?\"\n\n\"It will not be in my power, Catherine.\"\n\n\"Come when you can, then.\"\n\nEleanor made no answer; and Catherine s thoughts recurring to something\nmore directly interesting, she added, thinking aloud, \"Monday so soon\nas Monday; and you _all_ go. Well, I am certain of I shall be able to\ntake leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know.\nDo not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My father\nand mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The\ngeneral will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way and then\nI shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.\"\n\n\"Ah, Catherine! Were it settled so, it would be somewhat less\nintolerable, though in such common attentions you would have received\nbut half what you ought. But how can I tell you? tomorrow morning is\nfixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your\nchoice; the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven\no clock, and no servant will be offered you.\"\n\nCatherine sat down, breathless and speechless. \"I could hardly believe\nmy senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment that you\ncan feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than I\nmyself but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh! That I could suggest\nanything in extenuation! Good God! What will your father and mother\nsay! After courting you from the protection of real friends to\nthis almost double distance from your home, to have you driven out of\nthe house, without the considerations even of decent civility! Dear,\ndear Catherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty\nmyself of all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must\nhave been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal\nmistress of it, that my real power is nothing.\"\n\n\"Have I offended the general?\" said Catherine in a faltering voice.\n\n\"Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I\nanswer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence. He\ncertainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him\nmore so. His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred to\nruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation,\nwhich just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardly\nsuppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?\"\n\nIt was with pain that Catherine could speak at all; and it was only for\nEleanor s sake that she attempted it. \"I am sure,\" said she, \"I am very\nsorry if I have offended him. It was the last thing I would willingly\nhave done. But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement, you know,\nmust be kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I\nmight have written home. But it is of very little consequence.\"\n\n\"I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none;\nbut to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort,\nappearance, propriety, to your family, to the world. Were your friends,\nthe Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease;\na few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to be\ntaken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!\"\n\n\"Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that. And if we are to\npart, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference. I can\nbe ready by seven. Let me be called in time.\" Eleanor saw that she\nwished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should\navoid any further conversation, now left her with, \"I shall see you in\nthe morning.\"\n\nCatherine s swelling heart needed relief. In Eleanor s presence\nfriendship and pride had equally restrained her tears, but no sooner\nwas she gone than they burst forth in torrents. Turned from the house,\nand in such a way! Without any reason that could justify, any apology\nthat could atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence\nof it. Henry at a distance not able even to bid him farewell. Every\nhope, every expectation from him suspended, at least, and who could say\nhow long? Who could say when they might meet again? And all this by\nsuch a man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore\nso particularly fond of her! It was as incomprehensible as it was\nmortifying and grievous. From what it could arise, and where it would\nend, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm. The manner in\nwhich it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without any\nreference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearance\nof choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, the\nearliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved\nto have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that he might\nnot be obliged even to see her. What could all this mean but an\nintentional affront? By some means or other she must have had the\nmisfortune to offend him. Eleanor had wished to spare her from so\npainful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that any\ninjury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person\nnot connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it.\n\nHeavily passed the night. Sleep, or repose that deserved the name of\nsleep, was out of the question. That room, in which her disturbed\nimagination had tormented her on her first arrival, was again the scene\nof agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet how different now the\nsource of her inquietude from what it had been then how mournfully\nsuperior in reality and substance! Her anxiety had foundation in fact,\nher fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in the\ncontemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her\nsituation, the darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building,\nwere felt and considered without the smallest emotion; and though the\nwind was high, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout\nthe house, she heard it all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without\ncuriosity or terror.\n\nSoon after six Eleanor entered her room, eager to show attention or\ngive assistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be\ndone. Catherine had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her\npacking almost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message\nfrom the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared. What so\nnatural, as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it? And\nshe only wanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology\nmight properly be received by her. But the knowledge would have been\nuseless here; it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was\nput to the trial Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed between\nthem on meeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few and\ntrivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs,\nCatherine in busy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more\ngoodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything\nwas done they left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute\nbehind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known,\ncherished object, and went down to the breakfast-parlour, where\nbreakfast was prepared. She tried to eat, as well to save herself from\nthe pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable; but she had\nno appetite, and could not swallow many mouthfuls. The contrast between\nthis and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery, and\nstrengthened her distaste for everything before her. It was not four\nand twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast, but\nin circumstances how different! With what cheerful ease, what happy,\nthough false, security, had she then looked around her, enjoying\neverything present, and fearing little in future, beyond Henry s going\nto Woodston for a day! Happy, happy breakfast! For Henry had been\nthere; Henry had sat by her and helped her. These reflections were long\nindulged undisturbed by any address from her companion, who sat as deep\nin thought as herself; and the appearance of the carriage was the first\nthing to startle and recall them to the present moment. Catherine s\ncolour rose at the sight of it; and the indignity with which she was\ntreated, striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force, made\nher for a short time sensible only of resentment. Eleanor seemed now\nimpelled into resolution and speech.\n\n\"You _must_ write to me, Catherine,\" she cried; \"you _must_ let me hear\nfrom you as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I\nshall not have an hour s comfort. For _one_ letter, at all risks, all\nhazards, I must entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that\nyou are safe at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then,\ntill I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not\nexpect more. Direct to me at Lord Longtown s, and, I must ask it, under\ncover to Alice.\"\n\n\"No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am\nsure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home\nsafe.\"\n\nEleanor only replied, \"I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not\nimportune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at\na distance from you.\" But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying\nit, was enough to melt Catherine s pride in a moment, and she instantly\nsaid, \"Oh, Eleanor, I _will_ write to you indeed.\"\n\nThere was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle,\nthough somewhat embarrassed in speaking of. It had occurred to her that\nafter so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided\nwith money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting\nit to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to\nbe exactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till\nthat moment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but for\nthis kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the house\nwithout even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she\nmust have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely\nanother word was said by either during the time of their remaining\ntogether. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon\nannounced to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and\naffectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each\nother adieu; and, as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house\nwithout some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by\neither, she paused a moment, and with quivering lips just made it\nintelligible that she left \"her kind remembrance for her absent\nfriend.\" But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of\nrestraining her feelings; and, hiding her face as well as she could\nwith her handkerchief, she darted across the hall, jumped into the\nchaise, and in a moment was driven from the door.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 29\n\n\nCatherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had no\nterrors for her; and she began it without either dreading its length or\nfeeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage,\nin a violent burst of tears, she was conveyed some miles beyond the\nwalls of the abbey before she raised her head; and the highest point of\nground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was\ncapable of turning her eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she now\ntravelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily\npassed along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles,\nevery bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects\non which she had first looked under impressions so different. Every\nmile, as it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and\nwhen within the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to\nit, and thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and\nagitation were excessive.\n\nThe day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest\nof her life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had\nmade use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so\nspoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his\nactually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had he elated\nher by his pointed regard had he even confused her by his too\nsignificant reference! And now what had she done, or what had she\nomitted to do, to merit such a change?\n\nThe only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been\nsuch as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge. Henry and her own\nheart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly\nentertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each.\nDesignedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, by\nany strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of\nwhat she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fancies and\ninjurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of his\nindignation. If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer, she could\nnot wonder at his even turning her from his house. But a justification\nso full of torture to herself, she trusted, would not be in his power.\n\nAnxious as were all her conjectures on this point, it was not, however,\nthe one on which she dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more\nprevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,\nand look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her\nbeing gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every\nother, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it\nsometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence, and at others\nwas answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment.\nTo the general, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to\nEleanor what might he not say to Eleanor about her?\n\nIn this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one\narticle of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose,\nthe hours passed away, and her journey advanced much faster than she\nlooked for. The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her from\nnoticing anything before her, when once beyond the neighbourhood of\nWoodston, saved her at the same time from watching her progress; and\nthough no object on the road could engage a moment s attention, she\nfound no stage of it tedious. From this, she was preserved too by\nanother cause, by feeling no eagerness for her journey s conclusion;\nfor to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the\npleasure of a meeting with those she loved best, even after an absence\nsuch as hers an eleven weeks  absence. What had she to say that would\nnot humble herself and pain her family, that would not increase her own\ngrief by the confession of it, extend an useless resentment, and\nperhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill\nwill? She could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor s merit; she felt\nit too strongly for expression; and should a dislike be taken against\nthem, should they be thought of unfavourably, on their father s\naccount, it would cut her to the heart.\n\nWith these feelings, she rather dreaded than sought for the first view\nof that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles\nof home. Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger;\nbut after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for\nthe names of the places which were then to conduct her to it; so great\nhad been her ignorance of her route. She met with nothing, however, to\ndistress or frighten her. Her youth, civil manners, and liberal pay\nprocured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could\nrequire; and stopping only to change horses, she travelled on for about\neleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven\no clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton.\n\nA heroine returning, at the close of her career, to her native village,\nin all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of a\ncountess, with a long train of noble relations in their several\nphaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,\nbehind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well\ndelight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author\nmust share in the glory she so liberally bestows. But my affair is\nwidely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and\ndisgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness.\nA heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no\nattempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall\nher post-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups,\nand speedy shall be her descent from it.\n\nBut, whatever might be the distress of Catherine s mind, as she thus\nadvanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her\nbiographer in relating it, she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday\nnature for those to whom she went; first, in the appearance of her\ncarriage and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller being a\nrare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the\nwindow; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to\nbrighten every eye and occupy every fancy a pleasure quite unlooked for\nby all but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four\nyears old, who expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy\nthe glance that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that\nproclaimed the discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful\nproperty of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood.\n\nHer father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the\ndoor to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken\nthe best feelings of Catherine s heart; and in the embrace of each, as\nshe stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond\nanything that she had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed,\nshe was even happy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a\nshort time was subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at\nfirst little leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the\ntea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor\ntraveller, whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before\nany inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to\nher.\n\nReluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she then begin what might\nperhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her\nhearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could they at\nall discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her sudden\nreturn. They were far from being an irritable race; far from any\nquickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,\nwhen the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,\nfor the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any\nromantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter s long and\nlonely journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might\nhave been productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what\nthey could never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on\nsuch a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor\nfeelingly neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it,\nwhat could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so\nsuddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual\nill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as\nCatherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;\nand, after a due course of useless conjecture, that \"it was a strange\nbusiness, and that he must be a very strange man,\" grew enough for all\ntheir indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the\nsweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with\nyouthful ardour. \"My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless\ntrouble,\" said her mother at last; \"depend upon it, it is something not\nat all worth understanding.\"\n\n\"I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected this\nengagement,\" said Sarah, \"but why not do it civilly?\"\n\n\"I am sorry for the young people,\" returned Mrs. Morland; \"they must\nhave a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;\nCatherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General\nTilney.\" Catherine sighed. \"Well,\" continued her philosophic mother, \"I\nam glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all\nover, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good for young\npeople to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear\nCatherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but\nnow you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much\nchanging of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you\nhave not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.\"\n\nCatherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her own\namendment, but her spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and\nalone becoming soon her only wish, she readily agreed to her mother s\nnext counsel of going early to bed. Her parents, seeing nothing in her\nill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified\nfeelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey,\nparted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away; and\nthough, when they all met the next morning, her recovery was not equal\nto their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being\nany deeper evil. They never once thought of her heart, which, for the\nparents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her first\nexcursion from home, was odd enough!\n\nAs soon as breakfast was over, she sat down to fulfil her promise to\nMiss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her\nfriend s disposition was already justified, for already did Catherine\nreproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, with having\nnever enough valued her merits or kindness, and never enough\ncommiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure. The\nstrength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her pen;\nand never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing\nEleanor Tilney. To compose a letter which might at once do justice to\nher sentiments and her situation, convey gratitude without servile\nregret, be guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment a\nletter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of and, above\nall, which she might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see,\nwas an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance; and,\nafter long thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that\nshe could determine on with any confidence of safety. The money\ntherefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than\ngrateful thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate\nheart.\n\n\"This has been a strange acquaintance,\" observed Mrs. Morland, as the\nletter was finished; \"soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens\nso, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and\nyou were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well,\nwe must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will\nbe better worth keeping.\"\n\nCatherine coloured as she warmly answered, \"No friend can be better\nworth keeping than Eleanor.\"\n\n\"If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do\nnot be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in\nthe course of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!\"\n\nMrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation. The hope of\nmeeting again in the course of a few years could only put into\nCatherine s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting\ndreadful to her. She could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of him\nwith less tenderness than she did at that moment; but he might forget\nher; and in that case, to meet ! Her eyes filled with tears as she\npictured her acquaintance so renewed; and her mother, perceiving her\ncomfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as\nanother expedient for restoring her spirits, that they should call on\nMrs. Allen.\n\nThe two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they\nwalked, Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score\nof James s disappointment. \"We are sorry for him,\" said she; \"but\notherwise there is no harm done in the match going off; for it could\nnot be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not\nthe smallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without\nfortune; and now, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of\nher. Just at present it comes hard to poor James; but that will not\nlast forever; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life,\nfor the foolishness of his first choice.\"\n\nThis was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could\nlisten to; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance, and\nmade her reply less rational; for soon were all her thinking powers\nswallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and\nspirits since last she had trodden that well-known road. It was not\nthree months ago since, wild with joyful expectation, she had there run\nbackwards and forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay,\nand independent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed,\nand free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it.\nThree months ago had seen her all this; and now, how altered a being\ndid she return!\n\nShe was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her\nunlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally\ncall forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure,\non hearing how she had been treated though Mrs. Morland s account of it\nwas no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.\n\"Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,\" said she. \"She\ntravelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till\nSaturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all\nof a sudden grew tired of having her there, and almost turned her out\nof the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he must be a very odd\nman; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again! And it is a great\ncomfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift\nvery well for herself.\"\n\nMr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable\nresentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions\nquite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself. His\nwonder, his conjectures, and his explanations became in succession\nhers, with the addition of this single remark \"I really have not\npatience with the general\" to fill up every accidental pause. And, \"I\nreally have not patience with the general,\" was uttered twice after Mr.\nAllen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any material\ndigression of thought. A more considerable degree of wandering attended\nthe third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she immediately\nadded, \"Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent\nin my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one\ncan hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bath\nis a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above\nhalf like coming away. Mrs. Thorpe s being there was such a comfort to\nus, was not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.\"\n\n\"Yes, but _that_ did not last long,\" said Catherine, her eyes\nbrightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her\nexistence there.\n\n\"Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for\nnothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well? I\nput them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you\nknow, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember that\nevening?\"\n\n\"Do I! Oh! Perfectly.\"\n\n\"It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I\nalways thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable. I have a\nnotion you danced with him, but am not quite sure. I remember I had my\nfavourite gown on.\"\n\nCatherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects,\nMrs. Allen again returned to \"I really have not patience with the\ngeneral! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be! I do not\nsuppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His\nlodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine. But no\nwonder; Milsom Street, you know.\"\n\nAs they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her\ndaughter s mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr.\nand Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or\nunkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with\nher, while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her\nearliest friends. There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but\nthere are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has\nvery little power; and Catherine s feelings contradicted almost every\nposition her mother advanced. It was upon the behaviour of these very\nslight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended; and while\nMrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the\njustness of her own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting\nthat _now_ Henry must have arrived at Northanger; _now_ he must have\nheard of her departure; and _now_, perhaps, they were all setting off\nfor Hereford.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 30\n\n\nCatherine s disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her habits\nbeen ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her\ndefects of that sort, her mother could not but perceive them now to be\ngreatly increased. She could neither sit still nor employ herself for\nten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and\nagain, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if she\ncould even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time\nin the parlour. Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In\nher rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of\nherself; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all\nthat she had been before.\n\nFor two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but\nwhen a third night s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness,\nimproved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination\nfor needlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of,\n\"My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do\nnot know when poor Richard s cravats would be done, if he had no friend\nbut you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for\neverything a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have\nhad a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.\"\n\nCatherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that\n\"her head did not run upon Bath much.\"\n\n\"Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of\nyou; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should never\nfret about trifles.\" After a short silence \"I hope, my Catherine, you\nare not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as\nNorthanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed.\nWherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at\nhome, because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not\nquite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French\nbread at Northanger.\"\n\n\"I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what\nI eat.\"\n\n\"There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much\nsuch a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by\ngreat acquaintance The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some\nday or other, because I am sure it will do you good.\"\n\nCatherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied to\nher work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it\nherself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair,\nfrom the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved her\nneedle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,\nin her daughter s absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that\nrepining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of\ncheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,\nanxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some\ntime before she could find what she looked for; and other family\nmatters occurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere\nshe returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped.\nHer avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created\nherself, she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few\nminutes, till, on entering the room, the first object she beheld was a\nyoung man whom she had never seen before. With a look of much respect,\nhe immediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious\ndaughter as \"Mr. Henry Tilney,\" with the embarrassment of real\nsensibility began to apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging\nthat after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at\nFullerton, and stating his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland s\nhaving reached her home in safety, as the cause of his intrusion. He\ndid not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far\nfrom comprehending him or his sister in their father s misconduct, Mrs.\nMorland had been always kindly disposed towards each, and instantly,\npleased by his appearance, received him with the simple professions of\nunaffected benevolence; thanking him for such an attention to her\ndaughter, assuring him that the friends of her children were always\nwelcome there, and entreating him to say not another word of the past.\n\nHe was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart was\ngreatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that\nmoment in his power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in\nsilence to his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most\ncivilly answering all Mrs. Morland s common remarks about the weather\nand roads. Catherine meanwhile the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish\nCatherine said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye\nmade her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set\nher heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside\nthe first volume of The Mirror for a future hour.\n\nDesirous of Mr. Morland s assistance, as well in giving encouragement,\nas in finding conversation for her guest, whose embarrassment on his\nfather s account she earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early\ndispatched one of the children to summon him; but Mr. Morland was from\nhome and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of an\nhour she had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes  unbroken\nsilence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her\nmother s entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.\nAllen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her\nperplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable\nwould have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying his\nrespects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she would\nhave the goodness to show him the way. \"You may see the house from this\nwindow, sir,\" was information on Sarah s side, which produced only a\nbow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from her\nmother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary\nconsideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that\nhe might have some explanation to give of his father s behaviour, which\nit must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine,\nwould not on any account prevent her accompanying him. They began their\nwalk, and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in\nwishing it. Some explanation on his father s account he had to give;\nbut his first purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached\nMr. Allen s grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think\nit could ever be repeated too often. She was assured of his affection;\nand that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty\nequally knew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now\nsincerely attached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the\nexcellencies of her character and truly loved her society, I must\nconfess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude,\nor, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had\nbeen the only cause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new\ncircumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an\nheroine s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a\nwild imagination will at least be all my own.\n\nA very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,\nwithout sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation\nof her own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed\nthem to the ecstasies of another t te- -t te; and before it was\nsuffered to close, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned\nby parental authority in his present application. On his return from\nWoodston, two days before, he had been met near the abbey by his\nimpatient father, hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland s\ndeparture, and ordered to think of her no more.\n\nSuch was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand. The\naffrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she\nlistened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution\nwith which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious\nrejection, by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject; and\nas he proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of his\nfather s conduct, her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant\ndelight. The general had had nothing to accuse her of, nothing to lay\nto her charge, but her being the involuntary, unconscious object of a\ndeception which his pride could not pardon, and which a better pride\nwould have been ashamed to own. She was guilty only of being less rich\nthan he had supposed her to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of her\npossessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath,\nsolicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his\ndaughter-in-law. On discovering his error, to turn her from the house\nseemed the best, though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his\nresentment towards herself, and his contempt of her family.\n\nJohn Thorpe had first misled him. The general, perceiving his son one\nnight at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss\nMorland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her\nthan her name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of\nGeneral Tilney s importance, had been joyfully and proudly\ncommunicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of\nMorland s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon\nmarrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the\nfamily as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him\nbelieve them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected,\nhis own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as\nhis intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their\nfortune. The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the\nfirst overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been\ngradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the\ngrandeur of the moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount\nof Mr. Morland s preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a\nrich aunt, and sinking half the children, he was able to represent the\nwhole family to the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine,\nhowever, the peculiar object of the general s curiosity, and his own\nspeculations, he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or\nfifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a\npretty addition to Mr. Allen s estate. Her intimacy there had made him\nseriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to\nspeak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of\nFullerton naturally followed. Upon such intelligence the general had\nproceeded; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority.\nThorpe s interest in the family, by his sister s approaching connection\nwith one of its members, and his own views on another (circumstances of\nwhich he boasted with almost equal openness), seemed sufficient\nvouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of\nthe Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland s being under\ntheir care, and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of\ntheir treating her with parental kindness. His resolution was soon\nformed. Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the\ncountenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe s communication, he\nalmost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted\ninterest and ruining his dearest hopes. Catherine herself could not be\nmore ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children. Henry and\nEleanor, perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their\nfather s particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness,\ncontinuance, and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from\nsome hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son\nof doing everything in his power to attach her, Henry was convinced of\nhis father s believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not\ntill the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea\nof the false calculations which had hurried him on. That they were\nfalse, the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested\nthem, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced to meet again in town,\nand who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by\nCatherine s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent\nendeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella,\nconvinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship\nwhich could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that\nhe had said before to the advantage of the Morlands confessed himself\nto have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and\ncharacter, misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his\nfather a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the\ntwo or three last weeks proved him to be neither; for after coming\neagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the\nfamilies, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to\nthe point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to\nacknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent\nsupport. They were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too,\nalmost beyond example; by no means respected in their own\nneighbourhood, as he had lately had particular opportunities of\ndiscovering; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not\nwarrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections; a\nforward, bragging, scheming race.\n\nThe terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring\nlook; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error. The Allens, he\nbelieved, had lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on\nwhom the Fullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more.\nEnraged with almost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the\nnext day for the abbey, where his performances have been seen.\n\nI leave it to my reader s sagacity to determine how much of all this it\nwas possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how\nmuch of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his own\nconjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to be\ntold in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they\nmust divide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that\nin suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his\nwife, she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his\ncruelty.\n\nHenry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almost as\npitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He blushed for the\nnarrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose. The conversation\nbetween them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind.\nHenry s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on\ncomprehending his father s views, and being ordered to acquiesce in\nthem, had been open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary\noccasion to give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but\nof feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in\nwords, could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the\nsanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in\nsuch a cause, his anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate\nHenry, who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice.\nHe felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss\nMorland, and believing that heart to be his own which he had been\ndirected to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no\nreversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his fidelity, or\ninfluence the resolutions it prompted.\n\nHe steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, an\nengagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of\nCatherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his\nhand. The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadful\ndisagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours\nwere required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,\nand, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey to\nFullerton.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " 31\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Morland s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for\ntheir consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,\nconsiderable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an\nattachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more\nnatural than Catherine s being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it\nwith only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they\nalone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His pleasing\nmanners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having\nnever heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could\nbe told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his character\nneeded no attestation. \"Catherine would make a sad, heedless young\nhousekeeper to be sure,\" was her mother s foreboding remark; but quick\nwas the consolation of there being nothing like practice.\n\nThere was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that\none was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the\nengagement. Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady,\nand while his parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could\nnot allow themselves to encourage it. That the general should come\nforward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily\napprove it, they were not refined enough to make any parading\nstipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and\nthat once obtained and their own hearts made them trust that it could\nnot be very long denied their willing approbation was instantly to\nfollow. His _consent_ was all that they wished for. They were no more\ninclined than entitled to demand his _money_. Of a very considerable\nfortune, his son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his\npresent income was an income of independence and comfort, and under\nevery pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of their\ndaughter.\n\nThe young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. They\nfelt and they deplored but they could not resent it; and they parted,\nendeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each\nbelieved almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them\nagain in the fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what\nwas now his only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend\nhis improvements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked\nanxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether\nthe torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence,\nlet us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did they had been too\nkind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter,\nas, at that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another\nway.\n\nThe anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the\nportion of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its\nfinal event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who\nwill see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we\nare all hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which\ntheir early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable\ncircumstance could work upon a temper like the general s? The\ncircumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter\nwith a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course\nof the summer an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good\nhumour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained\nhis forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him \"to be a fool if\nhe liked it!\"\n\nThe marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such\na home as Northanger had been made by Henry s banishment, to the home\nof her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to\ngive general satisfaction among all her acquaintance. My own joy on the\noccasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending\nmerit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy\nfelicity. Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;\nand he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from\naddressing her. His unexpected accession to title and fortune had\nremoved all his difficulties; and never had the general loved his\ndaughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and\npatient endurance as when he first hailed her \"Your Ladyship!\" Her\nhusband was really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his\nwealth, and his attachment, being to a precision the most charming\nyoung man in the world. Any further definition of his merits must be\nunnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly\nbefore the imagination of us all. Concerning the one in question,\ntherefore, I have only to add aware that the rules of composition\nforbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable that\nthis was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him\nthat collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at\nNorthanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most\nalarming adventures.\n\nThe influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother s behalf\nwas assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland s circumstances\nwhich, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they\nwere qualified to give. It taught him that he had been scarcely more\nmisled by Thorpe s first boast of the family wealth than by his\nsubsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were\nthey necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand\npounds. This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that\nit greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no\nmeans without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at\nsome pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the\ndisposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every\ngreedy speculation.\n\nOn the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor s marriage,\npermitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the\nbearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty\nprofessions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon\nfollowed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and\neverybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the\nfirst day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful\ndelays occasioned by the general s cruelty, that they were essentially\nhurt by it. To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of\ntwenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself\nmoreover convinced that the general s unjust interference, so far from\nbeing really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive\nto it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength\nto their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may\nconcern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend\nparental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.",
