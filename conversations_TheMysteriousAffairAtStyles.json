        "raw text": " I.\nI GO TO STYLES\n\n\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\ntime as \"The Styles Case\" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\nsensational rumours which still persist.\n\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\nbeing connected with the affair.\n\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother's place in Essex.\n\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\n\n\"The mater will be delighted to see you again   after all those years,\"\nhe added.\n\n\"Your mother keeps well?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\"\n\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\nhad married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\nfortune of her own.\n\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife's\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\ntime of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her as\ntheir own mother.\n\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\nmarked success.\n\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\n\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and\nsmiled rather ruefully.\n\n\"Rotten little bounder too!\" he said savagely. \"I can tell you,\nHastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie   you\nremember Evie?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum,\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport   old Evie! Not precisely\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\"\n\n\"You were going to say      ?\"\n\n\"Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\nsecond cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seem\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He's got a great black beard,\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\nto him at once, took him on as secretary   you know how she's always\nrunning a hundred societies?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\nyears younger than she is! It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\nthere you are   she is her own mistress, and she's married him.\"\n\n\"It must be a difficult situation for you all.\"\n\n\"Difficult! It's damnable!\"\n\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\nto the car.\n\n\"Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\" he remarked. \"Mainly\nowing to the mater's activities.\"\n\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, that's just what I want.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\nworks regularly    on the land'. She is up at five every morning to milk,\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It's a jolly good life taking\nit all round   if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\" He\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \"I wonder if we've\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she'll have started from the hospital by\nnow.\"\n\n\"Cynthia! That's not your wife?\"\n\n\"No, Cynthia is a prot  g  e of my mother's, the daughter of an old\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\"\n\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\nstraightened herself at our approach.\n\n\"Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings   Miss Howard.\"\n\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\nfeet to match   these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\n\n\"Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press you\nin. Better be careful.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\" I\nresponded.\n\n\"Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later.\"\n\n\"You're a cynic, Evie,\" said John, laughing. \"Where's tea to-day   inside\nor out?\"\n\n\"Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\"\n\n\"Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day.    The labourer\nis worthy of his hire', you know. Come and be refreshed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \"I'm\ninclined to agree with you.\"\n\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\nof a large sycamore.\n\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\nmeet us.\n\n\"My wife, Hastings,\" said John.\n\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\nan exquisitely civilised body   all these things are burnt into my\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\n\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\nhad accepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\n\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\nwindow near at hand:\n\n\"Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the\nDuchess   about the school f  te.\"\n\nThere was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rose\nin reply:\n\n\"Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\nAlfred dear.\"\n\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\ndeference in his manner.\n\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\n\n\"Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings   my husband.\"\n\nI looked with some curiosity at \"Alfred darling\". He certainly struck a\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\n\n\"This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\" Then, turning to his wife: \"Emily\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\"\n\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\notherwise sensible woman!\n\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\n\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\npainstaking voice:\n\n\"Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\"\n\n\"No, before the war I was in Lloyd's.\"\n\n\"And you will return there after it is over?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\"\n\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\n\n\"What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\nconsult your inclination?\"\n\n\"Well, that depends.\"\n\n\"No secret hobby?\" she asked. \"Tell me   you're drawn to something?\nEveryone is   usually something absurd.\"\n\n\"You'll laugh at me.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\"\n\n\"The real thing   Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\n\"Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\nmethod. My system is based on his   though of course I have progressed\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\nwonderfully clever.\"\n\n\"Like a good detective story myself,\" remarked Miss Howard. \"Lots of\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\ndumbfounded. Real crime   you'd know at once.\"\n\n\"There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\" I argued.\n\n\"Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\nfamily. You couldn't really hoodwink them. They'd know.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, much amused, \"you think that if you were mixed up in a\ncrime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?\"\n\n\"Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\nBut I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my fingertips if he came near\nme.\"\n\n\"It might be a    she',\" I suggested.\n\n\"Might. But murder's a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\"\n\n\"Not in a case of poisoning.\" Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me.\n\"Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\"\n\n\"Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\" cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \"It\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there's\nCynthia!\"\n\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\n\n\"Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings   Miss Murdoch.\"\n\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\nwould have been a beauty.\n\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\n\n\"Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer.\"\n\nI dropped down obediently.\n\n\"You work at Tadminster, don't you, Miss Murdoch?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"For my sins.\"\n\n\"Do they bully you, then?\" I asked, smiling.\n\n\"I should like to see them!\" cried Cynthia with dignity.\n\n\"I have got a cousin who is nursing,\" I remarked. \"And she is terrified\nof    Sisters'.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\n_are_! You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\ndispensary.\"\n\n\"How many people do you poison?\" I asked, smiling.\n\nCynthia smiled too.\n\n\"Oh, hundreds!\" she said.\n\n\"Cynthia,\" called Mrs. Inglethorp, \"do you think you could write a few\nnotes for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Aunt Emily.\"\n\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\n\nMy hostess turned to me.\n\n\"John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member's\nwife   she was the late Lord Abbotsbury's daughter   does the same. She\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\nwar household; nothing is wasted here   every scrap of waste paper, even,\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\"\n\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\nover the park.\n\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\nInglethorp call \"Cynthia\" impatiently, and the girl started and ran\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John's younger\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\nthat singular expression to his face.\n\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\nmy own affairs.\n\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\n\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\n\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\n\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\n\n\"Look here, Mary, there's the deuce of a mess. Evie's had a row with\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she's off.\"\n\n\"Evie? Off?\"\n\nJohn nodded gloomily.\n\n\"Yes; you see she went to the mater, and   Oh,   here's Evie herself.\"\n\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\nthe defensive.\n\n\"At any rate,\" she burst out, \"I've spoken my mind!\"\n\n\"My dear Evelyn,\" cried Mrs. Cavendish, \"this can't be true!\"\n\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\n\n\"True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won't forget or\nforgive in a hurry. Don't mind if they've only sunk in a bit. Probably\nwater off a duck's back, though. I said right out:    You're an old\nwoman, Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool. The man's twenty\nyears younger than you, and don't you fool yourself as to what he\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don't let him have too much of it. Farmer\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\ntime he spends over there.' She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\n   I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. He's a bad lot. You can say\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I've told you. He's a bad lot!'\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\n\n\"   Darling Alfred'      dearest Alfred'      wicked calumnies'       wicked\nlies'      wicked woman'   to accuse her    dear husband!' The sooner I left\nher house the better. So I'm off.\"\n\n\"But not now?\"\n\n\"This minute!\"\n\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\nthink better of it.\n\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard's face changed. She leant towards me\neagerly.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings, you're honest. I can trust you?\"\n\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\nvoice to a whisper.\n\n\"Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They're a lot of\nsharks   all of them. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. There isn't one\nof them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I've\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I'm out of the way, they'll\nimpose upon her.\"\n\n\"Of course, Miss Howard,\" I said, \"I'll do everything I can, but I'm\nsure you're excited and overwrought.\"\n\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\n\n\"Young man, trust me. I've lived in the world rather longer than you\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You'll see what I mean.\"\n\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\nrose and moved to the door. John's voice sounded outside. With her hand\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\nme.\n\n\"Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil   her husband!\"\n\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\n\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\n\n\"Who is that?\" I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\n\n\"That's Dr. Bauerstein,\" said John shortly.\n\n\"And who is Dr. Bauerstein?\"\n\n\"He's staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\nbreakdown. He's a London specialist; a very clever man   one of the\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\"\n\n\"And he's a great friend of Mary's,\" put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\n\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\n\n\"Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\nthan Evelyn Howard.\"\n\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\n\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\nsmiled.\n\n\"That's a pretty girl,\" I remarked appreciatively.\n\nJohn's face hardened.\n\n\"That is Mrs. Raikes.\"\n\n\"The one that Miss Howard      \"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\n\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\n\n\"Styles is really a glorious old place,\" I said to John.\n\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\n\n\"Yes, it's a fine property. It'll be mine some day   should be mine now\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\nshouldn't be so damned hard up as I am now.\"\n\n\"Hard up, are you?\"\n\n\"My dear Hastings, I don't mind telling you that I'm at my wits' end\nfor money.\"\n\n\"Couldn't your brother help you?\"\n\n\"Lawrence? He's gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. My mother's\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\nher marriage, of course      \" he broke off, frowning.\n\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\nsecurity. Now that security was removed   and the air seemed rife with\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " II.\nTHE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\n\n\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\n\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\nreconciled.\n\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish's\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\nsee his attraction.\n\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\ngarden. I noticed that John's manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\nvery excited and restless.\n\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\n\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\nthe door.\n\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp's recitation\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\nacting with her in the tableaux.\n\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\n\n\"Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster's\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror   one of\nour oldest families.\"\n\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\nBauerstein.\n\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\nin the pony-trap.\n\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\naddressed as \"Nibs.\"\n\n\"What a lot of bottles!\" I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\nsmall room. \"Do you really know what's in them all?\"\n\n\"Say something original,\" groaned Cynthia. \"Every single person who\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\nthe first individual who does _not_ say:    What a lot of bottles!' And I\nknow the next thing you're going to say is:    How many people have you\npoisoned?'\"\n\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\n\n\"If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\nmistake, you wouldn't joke about it. Come on, let's have tea. We've got\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, Lawrence   that's the\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard   that's right.\"\n\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\nstern and forbidding expression.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\n\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\nenigmatical remark:\n\n\"_I_'m not really here to-day.\"\n\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\n\n\"This should have been sent up this morning.\"\n\n\"Sister is very sorry. She forgot.\"\n\n\"Sister should read the rules outside the door.\"\n\nI gathered from the little nurse's expression that there was not the\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\nthe dreaded \"Sister\".\n\n\"So now it can't be done until to-morrow,\" finished Cynthia.\n\n\"Don't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Cynthia graciously, \"we are very busy, but if we have time\nit shall be done.\"\n\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\ndoor.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Discipline must be maintained?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\nwards there.\"\n\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\nher watch.\n\n\"Nothing more to do, Nibs?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All right. Then we can lock up and go.\"\n\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\na couple of children.\n\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\n\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\n\n\"_Mon ami_ Hastings!\" he cried. \"It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\"\n\n\"Poirot!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI turned to the pony-trap.\n\n\"This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\"\n\n\"Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\" said Cynthia gaily. \"But I had no idea\nhe was a friend of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Poirot seriously. \"I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\" Then,\nas I looked at him inquiringly: \"Yes, my friend, she had kindly\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\nwith gratitude.\"\n\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\n\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\n\n\"He's a dear little man,\" said Cynthia. \"I'd no idea you knew him.\"\n\n\"You've been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\" I replied.\n\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\n\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" she said.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\" asked Cynthia.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \"What should there be?\"\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\n\n\"Yes, m'm.\" The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \"Don't\nyou think, m'm, you'd better get to bed? You're looking very tired.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right, Dorcas   yes   no   not now. I've some letters I must\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, m'm.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go to bed directly after supper.\"\n\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\n\n\"Goodness gracious! I wonder what's up?\" she said to Lawrence.\n\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\nheel and went out of the house.\n\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\n\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\n\n\"Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\" I asked, trying to appear as\nindifferent as I could.\n\n\"I didn't go,\" she replied abruptly. \"Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"In the boudoir.\"\n\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\n\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\ndesperately controlling herself:\n\n\"Then you won't show it to me?\"\n\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\n\n\"My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\"\n\n\"Then show it to me.\"\n\n\"I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\nleast.\"\n\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\n\n\"Of course, I might have known you would shield him.\"\n\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\n\n\"I say! There's been the most awful row! I've got it all out of\nDorcas.\"\n\n\"What kind of a row?\"\n\n\"Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she's found him out at last!\"\n\n\"Was Dorcas there, then?\"\n\n\"Of course not. She    happened to be near the door'. It was a real old\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\"\n\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes's gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard's warnings,\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \"Aunt Emily will send him\naway, and will never speak to him again.\"\n\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish's\nconcern in the matter?\n\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\nme afresh.\n\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\nretired to her boudoir again.\n\n\"Send my coffee in here, Mary,\" she called. \"I've just five minutes to\ncatch the post.\"\n\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\n\n\"Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\" she\nasked. \"Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\nit out.\"\n\n\"Do not trouble, Mary,\" said Inglethorp. \"I will take it to Emily.\" He\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\n\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\n\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\n\n\"It's almost too hot,\" she murmured. \"We shall have a thunderstorm.\"\n\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\nvoice in the hall.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" exclaimed Cynthia. \"What a funny time to come.\"\n\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\n\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\nplastered with mud.\n\n\"What have you been doing, doctor?\" cried Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"I must make my apologies,\" said the doctor. \"I did not really mean to\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\n\n\"Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\" said John, strolling in from\nthe hall. \"Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will.\" He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\n\n\"The sun soon dried me off,\" he added, \"but I'm afraid my appearance is\nvery disreputable.\"\n\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\nthe girl ran out.\n\n\"Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I'm going to bed.\"\n\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\nher hand.\n\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I'll walk down to the village with you,\" said Mr. Inglethorp. \"I must\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\" He turned to John. \"No one\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " III.\nTHE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\n\n\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants' rooms are reached through the door\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\nInglethorps' rooms were situated.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\nmy scattered thoughts.\n\n\"We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\"\n\n\"I'll come at once.\"\n\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\n\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\nbrother.\n\n\"What do you think we had better do?\"\n\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\n\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp's door violently, but with\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\n\n\"Try going through Mr. Inglethorp's room, sir,\" cried Dorcas. \"Oh, the\npoor mistress!\"\n\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us   that he\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\n\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\n\n\"Oh, dear, sir,\" cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \"what ever shall we\ndo?\"\n\n\"We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It'll be a tough job,\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we'll have a try at the door.\nHalf a moment, though, isn't there a door into Miss Cynthia's rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but that's always bolted. It's never been undone.\"\n\n\"Well, we might just see.\"\n\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia's room. Mary Cavendish was\nthere, shaking the girl   who must have been an unusually sound\nsleeper   and trying to wake her.\n\nIn a moment or two he was back.\n\n\"No good. That's bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\"\n\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\nburst open.\n\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\nthe pillows.\n\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\non the corridor.\n\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man's face. He\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\nharmless enough.\n\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp's attack seemed to be passing. She was\nable to speak in short gasps.\n\n\"Better now   very sudden   stupid of me   to lock myself in.\"\n\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\n\n\"Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,\" said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o'clock.\n\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\npeculiar fashion.\n\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\n\n\"Alfred   Alfred      \" Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\n\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\nthat he himself had little hope.\n\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp's\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\n\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\n\n\"Ve   ry sad. Ve   ry sad,\" murmured Dr. Wilkins. \"Poor dear lady. Always\ndid far too much   far too much   against my advice. I warned her. Her\nheart was far from strong.    Take it easy,' I said to her,\n   Take   it   easy'. But no   her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\nrebelled. Na   ture   re   belled.\"\n\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\n\n\"The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite   tetanic in\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\n\n\"I should like to speak to you in private,\" said Dr. Bauerstein. He\nturned to John. \"You do not object?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\n\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein's manner had started a\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\narm.\n\n\"What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so   peculiar?\"\n\nI looked at her.\n\n\"Do you know what I think?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Listen!\" I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\nvoice to a whisper. \"I believe she has been poisoned! I'm certain Dr.\nBauerstein suspects it.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \"No,\nno   not that   not that!\" And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\n\n\"No, no   leave me. I'd rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\nminute or two. Go down to the others.\"\n\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\n\n\"Where is Mr. Inglethorp?\"\n\nJohn shook his head.\n\n\"He's not in the house.\"\n\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words. What lay\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\n\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\n\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.\"\n\n\"Is that necessary?\" asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\nface.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Dr. Bauerstein.\n\n\"You mean by that      ?\"\n\n\"That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\nJohn bent his head.\n\n\"In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \"We propose that it should take\nplace to-morrow night   or rather to-night.\" And he glanced at the\ndaylight. \"Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\nbe avoided   these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won't\ndistress yourselves.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\npocket, and handed them to John.\n\n\"These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\"\n\nThe doctors then departed.\n\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\nhad come for me to take the lead.\n\n\"John,\" I said, \"I am going to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\nHe has been a most famous detective.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I want you to let me call him in   to investigate this matter.\"\n\n\"What   now? Before the post-mortem?\"\n\n\"Yes, time is an advantage if   if   there has been foul play.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" cried Lawrence angrily. \"In my opinion the whole thing is a\nmare's nest of Bauerstein's! Wilkins hadn't an idea of such a thing,\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\nBauerstein's got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\"\n\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence's attitude. He was so seldom\nvehement about anything.\n\nJohn hesitated.\n\n\"I can't feel as you do, Lawrence,\" he said at last. \"I'm inclined to\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\ndon't want any unnecessary scandal.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I cried eagerly, \"you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\ndiscretion itself.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\nforgive me if I am wronging him!\"\n\nI looked at my watch. It was six o'clock. I determined to lose no time.\n\nFive minutes' delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IV.\nPOIROT INVESTIGATES\n\n\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\nhis absence?\n\nHe accosted me eagerly.\n\n\"My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\" I asked.\n\n\"Denby kept me late last night. It was one o'clock before we'd\nfinished. Then I found that I'd forgotten the latch-key after all. I\ndidn't want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\"\n\n\"How did you hear the news?\" I asked.\n\n\"Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\nself-sacrificing   such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\"\n\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\nwas!\n\n\"I must hurry on,\" I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\nwas bound.\n\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\n\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\n\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\n\n\"Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\naffair whilst I dress.\"\n\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\n\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words, of her\nhusband's absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\nthe latter's innuendoes.\n\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\n\n\"The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\nagitated; you are excited   it is but natural. Presently, when we are\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\nwill examine   and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\nthose of no importance, pouf!\"   he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\npuffed comically enough   \"blow them away!\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" I objected, \"but how are you going to decide\nwhat is important, and what isn't? That always seems the difficulty to\nme.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\nwith exquisite care.\n\n\"Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another   so we continue. Does the\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\nlittle fact   no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing   a link\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\nwe put it here!\" He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \"It is\nsignificant! It is tremendous!\"\n\n\"Y   es      \"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\nbefore it. \"Beware! Peril to the detective who says:    It is so small   it\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.' That way lies\nconfusion! Everything matters.\"\n\n\"I know. You always told me that. That's why I have gone into all the\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\"\n\n\"And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\nnothing   truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances   you are upset.\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\nparamount importance.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\"\n\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man's brain. He\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\n\n\"I don't remember,\" I said. \"And, anyway, I don't see      \"\n\n\"You do not see? But it is of the first importance.\"\n\n\"I can't see why,\" I said, rather nettled. \"As far as I can remember,\nshe didn't eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\nappetite away. That was only natural.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"it was only natural.\"\n\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\nme.\n\n\"Now I am ready. We will proceed to the ch  teau, and study matters on\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\non one side. Permit me.\" With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\n\n\"_  a y est!_ Now, shall we start?\"\n\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\n\n\"So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\nunder his prolonged gaze.\n\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\nregretted.\n\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\n\n\"No, you are right,\" he said, \"it is not as though there was a blood\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\nnot their own mother. Blood tells   always remember that   blood tells.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\nmind, but I can't see how it has anything to do with the matter?\"\n\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\nsaid:\n\n\"I do not mind telling you   though, as you know, it is not my habit to\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\ncoffee.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, what time was the coffee served?\"\n\n\"About eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight   certainly not\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\nInglethorp's case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\no'clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\nit. In the meantime, remember it.\"\n\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\nand haggard.\n\n\"This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\" he said. \"Hastings\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\"\n\n\"I comprehend perfectly.\"\n\n\"You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\"\n\n\"Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\"\n\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\ncigarette as he did so.\n\n\"You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\"\n\n\"Yes. I met him.\"\n\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\nwas too much for Poirot's feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\nneatly.\n\n\"It's jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\"\n\n\"That difficulty will not exist long,\" pronounced Poirot quietly.\n\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\nhim to me.\n\n\"Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\"\n\n\"The rooms are locked?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\"\n\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\nit.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\nforbearance.\n\n\"What have you, my friend,\" he cried, \"that you remain there like   how\ndo you say it?   ah, yes, the stuck pig?\"\n\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\n\n\"Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\nit.\"\n\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\n\n\"_Eh voil   une table!_\" cried Poirot. \"Ah, my friend, one may live in a\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\"\n\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\n\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\nwire through the handle.\n\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\nopposite leading into Cynthia's room. That door was also bolted, as I\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\n\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\nnear it.\n\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\n\n\"Cocoa   with   I think   rum in it.\"\n\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\n\n\"Ah, this is curious,\" said Poirot.\n\n\"I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\"\n\n\"You do not? Observe the lamp   the chimney is broken in two places; they\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\nto powder.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said wearily, \"I suppose someone must have stepped on it.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot, in an odd voice. \"Someone stepped on it.\"\n\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\nthem   a trick of his when he was agitated.\n\n\"_Mon ami_,\" he said, turning to me, \"somebody stepped on that cup,\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\ncontained strychnine or   which is far more serious   because it did not\ncontain strychnine!\"\n\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment's\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\npocket.\n\n\"I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\ndone   at once!\"\n\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely   even\ngoing so far as to smell it.\n\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\n\n\"We have found in this room,\" he said, writing busily, \"six points of\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you,\" I replied hastily.\n\n\"Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\nfloor.\"\n\n\"That may have been done some time ago,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\nfragment of some dark green fabric   only a thread or two, but\nrecognizable.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I cried. \"That was what you sealed up in the envelope.\"\n\n\"Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp's own\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\" With a\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\nfloor by the writing-table. \"It must have been done since yesterday,\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once   but that is not\nto the point.\"\n\n\"It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\"\n\n\"You brought only one candle into the room?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\nseemed to see something over here\"   I indicated the mantelpiece   \"that\nabsolutely paralysed him.\"\n\n\"That is interesting,\" said Poirot quickly. \"Yes, it is suggestive\"   his\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall   \"but it was not his candle\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence's candle, which is still on the\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"what do you deduce?\"\n\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\nuse my own natural faculties.\n\n\"And the sixth point?\" I asked. \"I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot thoughtfully. \"I might have included that in the six,\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\npresent.\"\n\nHe looked quickly round the room. \"There is nothing more to be done\nhere, I think, unless\"   he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\nin the grate. \"The fire burns   and it destroys. But by chance   there\nmight be   let us see!\"\n\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\ngave a faint exclamation.\n\n\"The forceps, Hastings!\"\n\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\nof half charred paper.\n\n\"There, _mon ami!_\" he cried. \"What do you think of that?\"\n\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:   \n\n[Illustration]\n\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\n\n\"Poirot!\" I cried. \"This is a fragment of a will!\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nI looked up at him sharply.\n\n\"You are not surprised?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said gravely, \"I expected it.\"\n\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\nbolted on the inside.\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said Poirot briskly, \"we will go. I should like to\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid   Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\"\n\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp's room, and Poirot delayed long\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\nInglethorp's room as before.\n\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\n\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"where are you?\"\n\n\"I am here, my friend.\"\n\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\n\n\"Admirable!\" he murmured. \"Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\ncrescent; and those diamonds   their neatness rejoices the eye. The\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\nit not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in   Dorcas\nis here.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment's satisfaction of the\neye.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this affair is more important.\"\n\n\"And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\nimportance?\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\nchose to take that line.\n\n\"You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\"\n\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\n\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\n\n\"Pray be seated, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\"\n\n\"Ten years, sir.\"\n\n\"That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\nto her, were you not?\"\n\n\"She was a very good mistress to me, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\nyou with Mr. Cavendish's full approval.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But I don't know that I ought      \" Dorcas hesitated.\n\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\n\n\"My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\nyour mistress's secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\nthat we should know all   if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\nmurderer to justice.\"\n\n\"Amen to that,\" said Dorcas fiercely. \"And, naming no names, there's\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\"\n\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\n\n\"Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday      \"\n\n\"What time was that?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say exactly, sir, but it wasn't tea-time by a long way.\nPerhaps four o'clock   or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\nangry in here. I didn't exactly mean to listen, but   well, there it is.\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly.    You have lied to\nme, and deceived me,' she said. I didn't hear what Mr. Inglethorp\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did   but she answered:    How\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\nupon our name!' Again I didn't hear what he said, but she went on:\n   Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.' Then I\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\"\n\n\"You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp's voice you heard?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, whose else's could it be?\"\n\n\"Well, what happened next?\"\n\n\"Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o'clock,\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\ntea   nothing to eat   to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful   so white\nand upset.    Dorcas,' she says,    I've had a great shock.'    I'm sorry for\nthat, m'm,' I says.    You'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\nm'm.' She had something in her hand. I don't know if it was a letter,\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn't believe what was written\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\nthere:    These few words   and everything's changed.' And then she says to\nme:    Never trust a man, Dorcas, they're not worth it!' I hurried off,\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\nshe'd feel better when she'd drunk it.    I don't know what to do,' she\nsays.    Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\nI'd rather hush it up if I could.' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\nshe didn't say any more.\"\n\n\"She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\ncase of hers.\"\n\n\"Is that where she usually kept important papers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\nevery night.\"\n\n\"When did she lose the key of it?\"\n\n\"She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\"\n\n\"But she had a duplicate key?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\n\n\"Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\nthat was lost?\" He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\n\nDorcas's eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\n\n\"That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\neverywhere for it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\ndress in her wardrobe?\"\n\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?\"\n\nDorcas reflected.\n\n\"Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\"\n\n\"Light or dark green?\"\n\n\"A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\"\n\n\"No, sir   not that I know of.\"\n\nPoirot's face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\notherwise. He merely remarked:\n\n\"Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\"\n\n\"Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn't.\"\n\n\"Why do you know so positively?\"\n\n\"Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\ndidn't have any more made up.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure of that?\"\n\n\"Positive, sir.\"\n\n\"Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn't ask you to\nsign any paper yesterday?\"\n\n\"To sign a paper? No, sir.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\ncould tell you, though she's a careless girl. Never cleared the\ncoffee-cups away last night. That's what happens when I'm not here to\nlook after things.\"\n\nPoirot lifted his hand.\n\n\"Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\nyou. I should like to examine them.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\"What time did you go out last evening?\"\n\n\"About six o'clock, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\" He rose and\nstrolled to the window. \"I have been admiring these flower beds. How\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?\"\n\n\"Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\na gentleman's place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\nA fair sight it was. But now there's only old Manning, and young\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\nAh, these are dreadful times!\"\n\n\"The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\nwill you send Annie to me here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\" I asked,\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \"And about the lost key\nand the duplicate?\"\n\n\"One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\" He\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\npowders.\n\n\"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom. It was Number\nSix of my catalogue.\"\n\n\"But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\nmuch importance?\"\n\n\"Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\nabout this box?\"\n\nI examined it closely.\n\n\"No, I can't say that I do.\"\n\n\"Look at the label.\"\n\nI read the label carefully: \"   One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.' No, I see nothing unusual.\"\n\n\"Not the fact that there is no chemist's name?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed. \"To be sure, that is odd!\"\n\n\"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\nprinted name?\"\n\n\"No, I can't say that I have.\"\n\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\n\n\"Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\nfriend.\"\n\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\nto reply.\n\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\ntragedy.\n\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\n\n\"I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\"\n\nAnnie considered.\n\n\"There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don't think I remember,\nsir   oh, yes, one was to Ross's, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\none, I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Think,\" urged Poirot.\n\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but it's clean gone. I don't think I can have noticed\nit.\"\n\n\"It does not matter,\" said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\ndisappointment. \"Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\nthat every night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\nin the night   whenever she fancied it.\"\n\n\"What was it? Plain cocoa?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\"\n\n\"Who took it to her room?\"\n\n\"I did, sir.\"\n\n\"Always?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"At what time?\"\n\n\"When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\"\n\n\"No, sir, you see there's not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\ntake it into her room later.\"\n\n\"The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\nfarther   servants' side?\"\n\n\"It's this side, sir.\"\n\n\"What time did you bring it up last night?\"\n\n\"About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\"\n\n\"And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp's room?\"\n\n\"When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o'clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\nup to bed before I'd finished.\"\n\n\"Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o'clock, the cocoa was standing\non the table in the left wing?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\n\n\"And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I never took the\nsalt near it.\"\n\n\"What makes you think there was salt in it?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Seeing it on the tray, sir.\"\n\n\"You saw some salt on the tray?\"\n\n\"Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress's room I saw\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\nit in.\"\n\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \"coarse kitchen salt\"\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\nmarvelled at Poirot's calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\n\n\"When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp's room, was the door leading into\nMiss Cynthia's room bolted?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\"\n\n\"And the door into Mr. Inglethorp's room? Did you notice if that was\nbolted too?\"\n\nAnnie hesitated.\n\n\"I couldn't rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn't say whether it\nwas bolted or not.\"\n\n\"When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\nafter you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.\"\n\n\"Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn't have a candle, only\na reading-lamp.\"\n\n\"Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\nand a hot iron.\"\n\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\n\n\"Did your mistress ever have a green dress?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a   how do you call it?   a sports coat?\"\n\n\"Not green, sir.\"\n\n\"Nor anyone else in the house?\"\n\nAnnie reflected.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\"\n\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\"\n\n\"What is a great discovery?\"\n\n\"Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"So you think that the cocoa   mark well what I say, Hastings, the\n_cocoa_   contained strychnine?\"\n\n\"Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\"\n\n\"It might have been salt,\" replied Poirot placidly.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\ntype of mind.\n\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\n\n\"You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I said coldly, \"it is not for me to dictate to you.\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\"\n\n\"A most admirable sentiment,\" remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\nfeet. \"Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\nsmaller desk in the corner?\"\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp's.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" He tried the roll top tentatively. \"Locked. But perhaps one of\nMrs. Inglethorp's keys would open it.\" He tried several, twisting and\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\nof satisfaction. \"_Voil  !_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\npinch.\" He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: \"Decidedly, he is a man of method,\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!\"\n\nA \"man of method\" was, in Poirot's estimation, the highest praise that\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\n\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\ndisconnectedly:\n\n\"There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\nami?_ There might have been? Yes\"   his eyes wandered round the\nroom   \"this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\nOnly this.\"\n\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n",

But, according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance, my friend.

        "raw text": " V.\n\"IT ISN'T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?\"\n\n\n\"Where did you find this?\" I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\n\n\"In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp's. But what does it mean?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I cannot say   but it is suggestive.\"\n\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp's\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\nmight have taken her own life?\n\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\ndistracted me.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"now to examine the coffee-cups!\"\n\n\"My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\nabout the cocoa?\"\n\n\"Oh, _l   l  !_ That miserable cocoa!\" cried Poirot flippantly.\n\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\n\n\"And, anyway,\" I said, with increasing coldness, \"as Mrs. Inglethorp\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!\"\n\nPoirot was sobered at once.\n\n\"Come, come, my friend,\" he said, slipping his arms through mine. \"_Ne\nvous f  chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\"\n\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\nundisturbed as we had left them.\n\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\n\n\"So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray   and poured out. Yes. Then she came\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's. And the one on the tray?\"\n\n\"John Cavendish's. I saw him put it down there.\"\n\n\"Good. One, two, three, four, five   but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\nInglethorp?\"\n\n\"He does not take coffee.\"\n\n\"Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\"\n\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\n\n\"_Bien!_\" he said at last. \"It is evident! I had an idea   but clearly I\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\nmatter!\"\n\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\nhad been a great man in his day.\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\n\"You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\"\n\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\n\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\nsending telegrams   one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard   writing\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\n\n\"May I ask how things are proceeding?\" he said. \"Do your investigations\npoint to my mother having died a natural death   or   or must we prepare\nourselves for the worst?\"\n\n\"I think, Mr. Cavendish,\" said Poirot gravely, \"that you would do well\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\nof the other members of the family?\"\n\n\"My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\nheart failure.\"\n\n\"He does, does he? That is very interesting   very interesting,\" murmured\nPoirot softly. \"And Mrs. Cavendish?\"\n\nA faint cloud passed over John's face.\n\n\"I have not the least idea what my wife's views on the subject are.\"\n\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\n\n\"I told you, didn't I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\"\n\nPoirot bent his head.\n\n\"It's an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\nas usual   but, hang it all, one's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\nwith a possible murderer!\"\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp's\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten   that\nhe did not take it after all?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\nhall drawer. I'll go and see if it's there now.\"\n\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\n\n\"No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\nreplace it by now.\"\n\n\"But do you think      \"\n\n\"I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\nfavour. That is all.\"\n\nJohn looked perplexed.\n\n\"Do not worry,\" said Poirot smoothly. \"I assure you that you need not\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\nbreakfast.\"\n\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\ntragedy.\n\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\nman.\n\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\n\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\n\n\"Yes, I've got the most beastly headache.\"\n\n\"Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\" said Poirot solicitously.\n\"It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de t  te_.\" He\njumped up and took her cup.\n\n\"No sugar,\" said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\nsugar-tongs.\n\n\"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I never take it in coffee.\"\n\n\"_Sacr  !_\" murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\nreplenished cup.\n\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\nas green as a cat's. He had heard or seen something that had affected\nhim strongly   but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\nattention.\n\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\n\n\"Mr. Wells to see you, sir,\" she said to John.\n\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\nInglethorp had written the night before.\n\nJohn rose immediately.\n\n\"Show him into my study.\" Then he turned to us. \"My mother's lawyer,\"\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: \"He is also Coroner   you understand.\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?\"\n\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\n\n\"There will be an inquest then?\"\n\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\nmy curiosity was aroused.\n\n\"What is it? You are not attending to what I say.\"\n\n\"It is true, my friend. I am much worried.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\"\n\n\"What? You cannot be serious?\"\n\n\"But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\nunderstand. My instinct was right.\"\n\n\"What instinct?\"\n\n\"The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\n_Chut!_ no more now!\"\n\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\n\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\ntypical lawyer's mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\nreason of our presence.\n\n\"You will understand, Wells,\" he added, \"that this is all strictly\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\ninvestigation of any kind.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Mr. Wells soothingly. \"I wish we could have\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it's\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor's certificate.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\nadded rather hesitatingly: \"Shall we have to appear as witnesses   all of\nus, I mean?\"\n\n\"You, of course   and ah   er   Mr.   er   Inglethorp.\"\n\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\n\n\"Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\nform.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nA faint expression of relief swept over John's face. It puzzled me, for\nI saw no occasion for it.\n\n\"If you know of nothing to the contrary,\" pursued Mr. Wells, \"I had\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor's\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then that arrangement will suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\nmost tragic affair.\"\n\n\"Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\" interposed Poirot,\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\nhave received the letter this morning.\"\n\n\"I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\ngreat importance.\"\n\n\"She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, no.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said John.\n\n\"A great pity,\" agreed Poirot gravely.\n\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\n\n\"Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you   that is, if it\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\nInglethorp's death, who would inherit her money?\"\n\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\n\n\"The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\ndoes not object      \"\n\n\"Not at all,\" interpolated John.\n\n\"I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\nMr. John Cavendish.\"\n\n\"Was not that   pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish   rather unfair to her\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father's\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother's\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\"\n\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\n\n\"As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\nand void.\"\n\n\"_Hein!_\" said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \"Was\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\"\n\n\"I do not know. She may have been.\"\n\n\"She was,\" said John unexpectedly. \"We were discussing the matter of\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\"\n\n\"Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say    her last will.' Had Mrs.\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?\"\n\n\"On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\" said Mr.\nWells imperturbably. \"She was given to changing her mind as to her\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\nher family.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" suggested Poirot, \"that, unknown to you, she had made a new\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\nmember of the family   we will say Miss Howard, for instance   would you be\nsurprised?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\n\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp's papers.\n\n\"Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\nHoward?\" I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why did you ask?\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\n\n\"Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\nmother's papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\nto Mr. Wells and myself.\"\n\n\"Which simplifies matters very much,\" murmured the lawyer. \"As\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled      \" He did not finish the\nsentence.\n\n\"We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\" explained John,\n\"and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"it is quite possible that there may be a later\nwill than the one in my possession.\"\n\n\"There _is_ a later will.\" It was Poirot who spoke.\n\n\"What?\" John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\n\n\"Or, rather,\" pursued my friend imperturbably, \"there _was_ one.\"\n\n\"What do you mean   there was one? Where is it now?\"\n\n\"Burnt!\"\n\n\"Burnt?\"\n\n\"Yes. See here.\" He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp's room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\n\n\"But possibly this is an old will?\"\n\n\"I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.\"\n\n\"What?\" \"Impossible!\" broke simultaneously from both men.\n\nPoirot turned to John.\n\n\"If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course   but I don't see      \"\n\nPoirot raised his hand.\n\n\"Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" He rang the bell.\n\nDorcas answered it in due course.\n\n\"Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nDorcas withdrew.\n\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\n\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\nnodded.\n\n\"Come inside, Manning,\" said John, \"I want to speak to you.\"\n\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\n\n\"Manning,\" said John, \"this gentleman will put some questions to you\nwhich I want you to answer.\"\n\n\"Yessir,\" mumbled Manning.\n\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning's eye swept over him with a\nfaint contempt.\n\n\"You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, me and Willum.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, she did.\"\n\n\"Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like   I\ndon't know what exactly   she wrote it down for him.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, he did, sir.\"\n\n\"And what happened next?\"\n\n\"We went on with the begonias, sir.\"\n\n\"Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\npaper   under where she'd signed.\"\n\n\"Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?\" asked\nPoirot sharply.\n\n\"No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\"\n\n\"And you signed where she told you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.\"\n\n\"What did she do with it afterwards?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\"\n\n\"What time was it when she first called you?\"\n\n\"About four, I should say, sir.\"\n\n\"Not earlier? Couldn't it have been about half-past three?\"\n\n\"No, I shouldn't say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\nfour   not before it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Manning, that will do,\" said Poirot pleasantly.\n\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\ncautiously out of the window.\n\nWe all looked at each other.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" murmured John. \"What an extraordinary coincidence.\"\n\n\"How   a coincidence?\"\n\n\"That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\"\n\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\n\n\"Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with   someone yesterday\nafternoon      \"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\nand he had gone very pale.\n\n\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\nwould have consulted me on the subject   but she had no chance. The will\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\"\n\n\"Suggestive, or not,\" interrupted John, \"we are most grateful to\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?\"\n\nPoirot smiled and answered:\n\n\"A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\"\n\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\nwindow as it swept past.\n\n\"Evie!\" cried John. \"Excuse me, Wells.\" He went hurriedly out into the\nhall.\n\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\n\n\"Miss Howard,\" I explained.\n\n\"Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\"\n\nI followed John's example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\n\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\n\n\"Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\ncar. Quickest way to get here.\"\n\n\"Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\" asked John.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I thought not. Come along, breakfast's not cleared away yet, and\nthey'll make you some fresh tea.\" He turned to me. \"Look after her,\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here's Monsieur\nPoirot. He's helping us, you know, Evie.\"\n\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\nshoulder at John.\n\n\"What do you mean   helping us?\"\n\n\"Helping us to investigate.\"\n\n\"Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\"\n\n\"Taken who to prison?\"\n\n\"Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\"\n\n\"My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\ndied from heart seizure.\"\n\n\"More fool, Lawrence!\" retorted Miss Howard. \"Of course Alfred\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily   as I always told you he would.\"\n\n\"My dear Evie, don't shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn't\nuntil Friday.\"\n\n\"Not until fiddlesticks!\" The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\nmagnificent. \"You're all off your heads. The man will be out of the\ncountry by then. If he's any sense, he won't stay here tamely and wait\nto be hanged.\"\n\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\n\n\"I know what it is,\" she accused him, \"you've been listening to the\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all   or just enough\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know   my own father was a doctor.\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he'd\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he's done it. And all you can do\nis to murmur silly things about    heart seizure' and    inquest on\nFriday.' You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\n\"Dash it all, Evie, I can't haul him down to the local police station\nby the scruff of his neck.\"\n\n\"Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He's a crafty\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she's missed any.\"\n\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\n\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\nHoward.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said gravely, \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Ask away,\" said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\n\n\"I want to be able to count upon your help.\"\n\n\"I'll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\" she replied gruffly.\n\"Hanging's too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\ngood old times.\"\n\n\"We are at one then,\" said Poirot, \"for I, too, want to hang the\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"Alfred Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Him, or another.\"\n\n\"No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\nalong. I don't say she wasn't surrounded by sharks   she was. But it was\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp   and within two months   hey presto!\"\n\n\"Believe me, Miss Howard,\" said Poirot very earnestly, \"if Mr.\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\nhang him as high as Haman!\"\n\n\"That's better,\" said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\n\n\"But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\nare the only eyes that have wept.\"\n\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\nvoice.\n\n\"If you mean that I was fond of her   yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\nthem   and, that way she missed love. Don't think she ever realized it,\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\nfooting. I took my stand from the first.    So many pounds a year I'm\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides   not a pair\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.' She didn't understand   was very\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn't that   but I\ncouldn't explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\ngo for nothing.\"\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm   that we lack fire and\nenergy   but trust me, it is not so.\"\n\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\nto Mrs. Inglethorp's room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\n\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\nlowered his voice confidentially:\n\n\"Look here, what's going to happen when these two meet?\"\n\nI shook my head helplessly.\n\n\"I've told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\"\n\n\"Will she be able to do so?\"\n\n\"The Lord only knows. There's one thing, Inglethorp himself won't be\ntoo keen on meeting her.\"\n\n\"You've got the keys still, haven't you, Poirot?\" I asked, as we\nreached the door of the locked room.\n\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\n\n\"My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\nbelieve,\" he said.\n\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\n\n\"Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\"\n\n\"But it's not locked now.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"See.\" And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\n\n\"_Milles tonnerres!_\" cried Poirot, dumbfounded. \"And I   who have both\nthe keys in my pocket!\" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\nstiffened. \"_Eh voil   une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nPoirot laid down the case again.\n\n\"But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\"\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\n\nPoirot answered them categorically   almost mechanically.\n\n\"Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\"\n\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\n\n\"See here, it was like this,\" he said at last. \"There was something in\nthat case   some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\nbeen something of great importance.\"\n\n\"But what was it?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \"That, I do not know! A\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I   \" his anger burst\nforth freely   \"miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\ngone. It is destroyed   but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance   we\nmust leave no stone unturned   \"\n\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\n\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\n\n\"What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\"\n\n\"He's rather upset about something,\" I remarked feebly. I really did\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish's expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\nand turn the conversation by saying: \"They haven't met yet, have they?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\"\n\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\n\n\"Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\"\n\n\"Well, don't you?\" I said, rather taken aback.\n\n\"No.\" She was smiling in her quiet way. \"I should like to see a good\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\nmuch, and saying so little.\"\n\n\"John doesn't think so,\" I remarked. \"He's anxious to keep them apart.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\"\n\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\n\n\"Old John's an awfully good sort.\"\n\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\ngreat surprise:\n\n\"You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\"\n\n\"Aren't you my friend too?\"\n\n\"I am a very bad friend.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\nall about them the next.\"\n\nI don't know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\nand not in the best of taste:\n\n\"Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\"\n\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\n\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"is this wise? Surely you don't want the\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\nthe criminal's hands.\"\n\n\"You think so, Hastings?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\"\n\n\"Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"let us go, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"You have finished here?\"\n\n\"For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\"\n\n\"Willingly.\"\n\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\n\n\"Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she turned inquiringly.\n\n\"Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp's medicines?\"\n\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Only her powders?\"\n\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\n\n\"Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\"\n\n\"These?\"\n\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\"\n\n\"No, they were bromide powders.\"\n\n\"Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\"\n\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\neyes turned green like a cat's. They were shining like emeralds now.\n\n\"My friend,\" he broke out at last, \"I have a little idea, a very\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet   it fits in.\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\nwas only too plain and apparent.\n\n\"So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\" I remarked.\n\"Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\nmyself.\"\n\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\n\n\"They have made one more discovery, _l  -bas_,\" he observed, jerking his\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \"Mr. Wells told me\nas we were going upstairs.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\nInglethorp's, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells   and to John Cavendish also. It was\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\nservants   not Dorcas.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\"\n\n\"He says not.\"\n\n\"One might take that with a grain of salt,\" I remarked sceptically.\n\"All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\nyesterday afternoon?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\"\n\n\"Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\nwill notice that the word    possessed' is spelt first with one    s' and\nsubsequently with two   correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\nin a sentence, thus:    I am possessed.' Now, what did that tell me? It\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word    possessed' that\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\nin my mind, the possibility of a will   (a document almost certain to\ncontain that word)   occurred to me at once. This possibility was\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\ndeposit.\n\n\"I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\nboth of the gardeners   for there were two sets of footprints in the\nbed   had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\nin my supposition.\"\n\n\"That was very ingenious,\" I could not help admitting. \"I must confess\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\nerroneous.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\nlikely.\"\n\n\"Another point   how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\nbeen lost?\"\n\n\"I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\nlock of the despatch-case.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\"\n\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\n\n\"You are very sure of his guilt?\"\n\n\"Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\nclearly.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Poirot quietly, \"there are several points in\nhis favour.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I see only one.\"\n\n\"And that?\"\n\n\"That he was not in the house last night.\"\n\n\"   Bad shot!' as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\nmy mind tells against him.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\nreason of his own for his absence.\"\n\n\"And that reason?\" I asked sceptically.\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel   but that does not of necessity\nmake him a murderer.\"\n\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\n\n\"We do not agree, eh?\" said Poirot. \"Well, let us leave it. Time will\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\nwere bolted on the inside?\"\n\n\"Well      \" I considered. \"One must look at it logically.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted   our own eyes have\ntold us that   yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\nentered the room. You agree so far?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, encouraged, \"as the person who entered did not do so by\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room   a most\nunusual proceeding on her part   she had had a most violent quarrel with\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\"\n\n\"But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\nInglethorp herself?\"\n\n\"There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\nmorning, and bolted it then.\"\n\n\"Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?\"\n\n\"No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that,\" I said thoughtfully. \"That is as enigmatical as\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\ncertainly not her affair.\"\n\n\"Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\ndo.\"\n\n\"It is certainly curious,\" I agreed. \"Still, it is unimportant, and\nneed not be taken into account.\"\n\nA groan burst from Poirot.\n\n\"What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\nthe fact will not fit the theory   let the theory go.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" I said, nettled.\n\n\"Yes, we shall see.\"\n\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\nannoyance vanished.\n\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\n\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\nwas extraordinary   a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\n\n\"Look, Poirot!\" I said.\n\nHe leant forward.\n\n\"_Tiens!_\" he said. \"It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist's shop. He is\ncoming here.\"\n\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\n\n\"A little minute,\" cried Poirot from the window. \"I come.\"\n\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Poirot, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\nyou'd just come back from the Hall?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have.\"\n\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\n\n\"It's all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\nThey do say   \" he lowered his voice cautiously   \"that it's poison?\"\n\nPoirot's face remained quite impassive.\n\n\"Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\"\n\n\"Yes, exactly   of course      \" The young man hesitated, and then his\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\nhis voice to a whisper: \"Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn't   it\nisn't strychnine, is it?\"\n\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\nPoirot's eyes met mine.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding gravely. \"He will have evidence to give at the\ninquest.\"\n\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\n\n\"Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\nsome disorder   which is not well.\"\n\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\n\n\"It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\nyet   no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\"\n\n\"The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\nimportant.\"\n\n\"But it was a glorious day!\" I interrupted. \"Poirot, you're pulling my\nleg!\"\n\n\"Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\"\n\n\"And the second point?\" I asked.\n\n\"The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\"\n\n\"Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely serious, my friend.\"\n\n\"But this is childish!\"\n\n\"No, it is very momentous.\"\n\n\"And supposing the Coroner's jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\"\n\n\"They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\" he added\nplacidly, \"_I_ should not allow it!\"\n\n\"_You_ would not allow it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\n\n\"Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\" He got up and laid his\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\ncame into his eyes. \"In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved   no. But she was\nvery good to us Belgians   I owe her a debt.\"\n\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\n\n\"Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_   when a word from me\ncould save him!\"\n\n\n\n\n",

This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit."

        "raw text": " VI.\n\nTHE INQUEST\n\n\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\ndriving at.\n\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes's\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\nme cunningly.\n\n\"You'm from the Hall, bain't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. I'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\nthis way.\"\n\n\"A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\nfrom the village?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"He has been here, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, he's been here, right enough. More'n once too. Friend of\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall   you'm a pretty lot!\" And\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\n\n\"Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\" I asked, as\ncarelessly as I could.\n\nHe winked at me knowingly.\n\n\"_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I'm sure.\"\n\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\nInglethorp's liberality with another woman's money. Had that piquant\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\n\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\nwas four-thirty, and not four o'clock when she had heard the voices.\n\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o'clock, when\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\n\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\n\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\n\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother's death.\n\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\ntoxicology.\n\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\ngrain or slightly over.\n\n\"Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\"\nasked the Coroner.\n\n\"I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\nplaced on its sale.\"\n\n\"Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\nwas administered?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\"\n\n\"That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\nhurried there as fast as I could.\"\n\n\"Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?\"\n\n\"I entered Mrs. Inglethorp's room. She was at that moment in a typical\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\n   Alfred   Alfred      '\"\n\n\"Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\"\n\n\"Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\ncoffee after dinner about eight o'clock, whereas the symptoms did not\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\nevening.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\nthat?\"\n\n\"No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\"\n\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\n\n\"How did you know?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"I should say\"   the doctor was continuing   \"that I would have been\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\npowerless to mask it.\"\n\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\n\n\"No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\nthe taste of strychnine.\"\n\n\"Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\nanalyzing its contents.\"\n\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein's evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\nher own life.\n\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\n\n\"I should like to make a suggestion if I may?\"\n\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\"\n\n\"It is just an idea of mine,\" explained Lawrence. \"Of course I may be\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother's death might be\naccounted for by natural means.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\"\n\n\"My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Coroner.\n\nThe jury looked up, interested.\n\n\"I believe,\" continued Lawrence, \"that there have been cases where the\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\"\n\n\"This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\n\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\n\n\"What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\nabsurd.\"\n\n\"And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\ntaken an overdose?\"\n\n\"Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\ntime, as she dealt with Coot's, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\"\n\n\"Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\nway instrumental in causing her death?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\n\n\"That, of course, is always possible,\" replied the doctor.\n\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\n\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress's bell, and had\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\n\nDorcas's evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\n\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\nCoroner's question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\nsound of something heavy falling.\n\n\"That would have been the table by the bed?\" commented the Coroner.\n\n\"I opened my door,\" continued Mary, \"and listened. In a few minutes a\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\nwe all went to my mother-in-law's room, but it was locked      \"\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\n\n\"I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\nday before.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\n\"She is gaining time!\"\n\n\"Yes. I understand,\" continued the Coroner deliberately, \"that you were\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?\"\n\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\nwas news to him as well.\n\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\nshe answered:\n\n\"Yes, that is so.\"\n\n\"And the boudoir window was open, was it not?\"\n\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\nyou were than in the hall.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\"\n\n\"I really do not remember hearing anything.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\" A\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. \"I am not in the habit of\nlistening to private conversations.\"\n\nThe Coroner persisted.\n\n\"And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\nconversation?\"\n\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\n\n\"Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something   I do not remember\nexactly what   about causing scandal between husband and wife.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" the Coroner leant back satisfied. \"That corresponds with what\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\nyou were?\"\n\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\nquietly enough:\n\n\"No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\"\n\n\"And that is all you can tell us?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\nmore if she chose.\n\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\nat Styles.\n\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\n\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"You did not hear the table fall?\"\n\n\"No. I was fast asleep.\"\n\nThe Coroner smiled.\n\n\"A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\" he observed. \"Thank you,\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.\"\n\n\"Miss Howard.\"\n\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\nfacsimile:\n\nSTYLES COURT\nESSEX\nhand written note:\n\n     July 17th\n     My dear Evelyn\n     Can we not bury\n     the hachet? I have\n     found it hard to forgive\n     the things you said\n     against my dear husband\n     but I am an old woman\n     & very fond of you\n     Yours affectionately,\n    Emily Inglethorpe\n\n\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\n\n\"I fear it does not help us much,\" said the Coroner, with a sigh.\n\"There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\"\n\n\"Plain as a pikestaff to me,\" said Miss Howard shortly. \"It shows\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she'd been\nmade a fool of!\"\n\n\"It says nothing of the kind in the letter,\" the Coroner pointed out.\n\n\"No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn't going to own that I'd\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don't believe in it\nmyself.\"\n\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\n\n\"Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\" continued the\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \"Talk   talk   talk!\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well      \"\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\"\n\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\n\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\nchemist's assistant.\n\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\nCoroner's questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\n\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\n\n\"Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"Last Monday night.\"\n\n\"Monday? Not Tuesday?\"\n\n\"No, sir, Monday, the 16th.\"\n\n\"Will you tell us to whom you sold it?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\"\n\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\nfrom the young man's lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\n\n\"You are sure of what you say?\" asked the Coroner sternly.\n\n\"Quite sure, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\ncounter?\"\n\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner's frown.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir   of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\ndog.\"\n\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\n\"The Hall\"   especially when it might result in custom being transferred\nfrom Coot's to the local establishment.\n\n\"Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\"\n\n\"Have you got the book here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\n\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\nneck?\n\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\n\n\"On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\npoisoning a dog?\"\n\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\n\n\"No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\nwhich is in perfect health.\"\n\n\"You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\nMonday last?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Do you also deny _this_?\"\n\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\ninscribed.\n\n\"Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\nshow you.\"\n\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\n\n\"Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace's statement?\"\n\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\n\n\"Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.\"\n\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\"\n\n\"Really   I cannot remember.\"\n\n\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner sharply. \"Think\nagain.\"\n\nInglethorp shook his head.\n\n\"I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"I really can't remember.\"\n\nThe Coroner's face grew graver.\n\n\"Were you in company with anyone?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you meet anyone on your walk?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said the Coroner dryly. \"I am to take it then that\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\"\n\n\"If you like to take it that way, yes.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\"\n\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\n\n\"_Sacr  !_\" he murmured. \"Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\narrested?\"\n\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\n\n\"You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \"you have been misinformed.\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\"\n\n\"Have you anyone who can testify to that?\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" said Inglethorp haughtily.\n\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\n\n\"There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Those witnesses were mistaken.\"\n\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\nAlfred Inglethorp's guilt?\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner, \"you have heard your wife's dying\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\"\n\n\"Certainly I can.\"\n\n\"You can?\"\n\n\"It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured Poirot to himself. \"But it is an idea, that!\"\n\n\"You think it is true?\" I whispered.\n\n\"I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\"\n\n\"You read my wife's last words as an accusation\"   Inglethorp was\ncontinuing   \"they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\"\n\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\n\n\"I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\nand took it to your wife that evening?\"\n\n\"I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\nminutes later, it was gone.\"\n\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\ntime to introduce the poison.\n\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\n\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\n\n\"Do you know who that little man is?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard   Jimmy Japp.\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\nfriend.\"\n\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\nofficial personages.\n\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\nbeing given:\n\n\"Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII.\nPOIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\n\n\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\nScotland Yard men.\n\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\naccosted the shorter of the two.\n\n\"I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\"\n\n\"Why, if it isn't Mr. Poirot!\" cried the Inspector. He turned to the\nother man. \"You've heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\nI worked together   the Abercrombie forgery case   you remember, he was run\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\nremember    Baron' Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\nAntwerp   thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\"\n\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\n\n\"I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\" remarked\nPoirot.\n\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\n\n\"No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\"\n\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\n\n\"There I differ from you.\"\n\n\"Oh, come!\" said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\n\"Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man's caught\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\"\n\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\n\n\"Hold your fire, Summerhaye,\" he remarked jocularly. \"Me and Moosier\nhere have met before   and there's no man's judgment I'd sooner take than\nhis. If I'm not greatly mistaken, he's got something up his sleeve.\nIsn't that so, moosier?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"I have drawn certain conclusions   yes.\"\n\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\nscrutiny of Poirot.\n\n\"It's this way,\" he said, \"so far, we've only seen the case from the\noutside. That's where the Yard's at a disadvantage in a case of this\nkind, where the murder's only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that's where Mr.\nPoirot's had the start of us. We shouldn't have been here as soon as\nthis even, if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you've been\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\nI'd laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn't bring\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\nit hadn't been for the Coroner   he seemed to be holding them back.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\nnow,\" suggested Poirot.\n\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp's\nexpressive countenance.\n\n\"Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven't,\" he remarked dryly.\n\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\n\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\n\n\"Can't you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink's as good as a\nnod   from you. You've been on the spot   and the Yard doesn't want to make\nany mistakes, you know.\"\n\nPoirot nodded gravely.\n\n\"That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos   the case\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme   a!_\" And he snapped his\nfingers expressively.\n\nJapp's face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\n\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\n\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\n\n\"I daren't do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_'d take your word, but there's others\nover me who'll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can't you give me\na little more to go on?\"\n\nPoirot reflected a moment.\n\n\"It can be done,\" he said at last. \"I admit I do not wish it. It forces\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\npresent, but what you say is very just   the word of a Belgian policeman,\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\"\n\n\"Well, in about half an hour. We're seeing the Coroner and the doctor\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Good. Call for me in passing   the last house in the village. I will go\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses   as\nis probable   I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?\"\n\n\"That's a bargain,\" said Japp heartily. \"And, on behalf of the Yard,\nI'm much obliged to you, though I'm bound to confess I can't at present\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.\"\n\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\nhis face.\n\n\"Well, my friend,\" cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \"what do\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\"\n\n\"H'm! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\" I\nremarked. \"For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\nhimself except by silence?\"\n\n\"Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,\" cried Poirot. \"See; say that it is\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp's stony denials!\"\n\nI could not help laughing.\n\n\"My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp's\ninnocence?\"\n\n\"Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\"\n\n\"But the evidence is so conclusive.\"\n\n\"Yes, too conclusive.\"\n\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\nfamiliar stairs.\n\n\"Yes, yes, too conclusive,\" continued Poirot, almost to himself. \"Real\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\nexamined   sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured   so cleverly\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\"\n\n\"Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\"\n\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\n\n\"Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\nchemist's and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence   no\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist's assistant must\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!\"\n\n\"Still   I do not see      \" I began.\n\n\"Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_   Hercule\nPoirot!\"\n\n\"But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\nstrychnine?\"\n\n\"Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.\"\n\n\"But Mace recognized him!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\nInglethorp's, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\nMr. Inglethorp's rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot's in Tadminster.\"\n\n\"Then you think      \"\n\n\"_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?\"\n\n\"The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\na black beard, and uses glasses,\" I quoted.\n\n\"Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Of course an actor      \"\n\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\n\n\"And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\neyes   those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt. It was\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\nsure thing there must be tangible proof   such as the actual buying of\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\nInglethorp?\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" I said, fascinated by Poirot's eloquence. \"But, if that\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o'clock on Monday\nevening?\"\n\n\"Ah, why indeed?\" said Poirot, calming down. \"If he were arrested, he\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\nquite apart from the murder.\"\n\n\"What can it be?\" I mused, won over to Poirot's views for the moment,\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\nwas the correct one.\n\n\"Can you not guess?\" asked Poirot, smiling.\n\n\"No, can you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago   and it has turned out to be\ncorrect.\"\n\n\"You never told me,\" I said reproachfully.\n\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\n\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\" He turned\nto me earnestly. \"Tell me   you see now that he must not be arrested?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\nno harm.\n\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" he said, changing the subject, \"apart from Mr.\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\"\n\n\"Oh, pretty much what I expected.\"\n\n\"Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\"\n\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's evidence for instance?\"\n\nI was relieved.\n\n\"Oh, Lawrence! No, I don't think so. He's always a nervous chap.\"\n\n\"His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\nstrange    _hein?_\"\n\n\"No, I can't say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\"\n\n\"But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true. I never thought of that.\" I was rather startled. \"It\n_is_ odd.\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence   no!\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\"\n\n\"It's very confusing,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,\" continued Poirot. \"That's another who\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\"\n\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\n\n\"Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\nof that    private conversation' than she was willing to admit.\"\n\n\"And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\neavesdrop!\"\n\n\"Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\nafternoon, about four o'clock, as she said.\"\n\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\nthat point.\n\n\"Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\" continued Poirot.\n\"Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\nfact.\"\n\n\"He has insomnia, I believe,\" I said doubtfully.\n\n\"Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\" remarked Poirot. \"It\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\"\n\n\"Any more faults to find with the evidence?\" I inquired satirically.\n\n\"_Mon ami_,\" replied Poirot gravely, \"when you find that people are not\ntelling you the truth   look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\ninquest to-day only one   at most, two persons were speaking the truth\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, Poirot! I won't cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\nthere's John   and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\"\n\n\"Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both      !\"\n\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard's evidence,\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot's sagacity   except on\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as \"foolishly\npig-headed.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" I asked. \"Miss Howard had always seemed to me\nso essentially honest   almost uncomfortably so.\"\n\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\n\n\"Miss Murdoch too,\" I continued, \"there's nothing untruthful about\n_her_.\"\n\n\"No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\"\n\n\"Well, she's young. And she sleeps soundly.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\"\n\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\n\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\nset out for Styles.\n\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\nshock   especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\nhave done.\n\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\nto make his boast good.\n\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\nhis belief in Inglethorp's innocence, but a man of the type of\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\ncould supply.\n\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\ntangible reality. We had read of such things   now we ourselves were\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\n\n\"MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\"\n\n    \"WEALTHY LADY POISONED\"\n\n\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \"The family leaving\nthe Inquest\"   the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\nthat one had read a hundred times   things that happen to other people,\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\nfront of us were \"the detectives in charge of the case.\" The well-known\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\n\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\n\n\"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\" said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, \"I have asked you to come here\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\nInglethorp.\"\n\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself   I think, unconsciously,\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him   and he gave a faint\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said Poirot, addressing him directly, \"a very dark\nshadow is resting on this house   the shadow of murder.\"\n\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\n\n\"My poor wife,\" he murmured. \"Poor Emily! It is terrible.\"\n\n\"I do not think, monsieur,\" said Poirot pointedly, \"that you quite\nrealize how terrible it may be   for you.\" And as Inglethorp did not\nappear to understand, he added: \"Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\nvery grave danger.\"\n\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \"Anything you\nsay will be used in evidence against you,\" actually hovering on\nSummerhaye's lips. Poirot went on.\n\n\"Do you understand now, monsieur?\"\n\n\"No. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Poirot deliberately, \"that you are suspected of\npoisoning your wife.\"\n\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Inglethorp, starting up. \"What a monstrous idea!\n_I_   poison my dearest Emily!\"\n\n\"I do not think\"   Poirot watched him narrowly   \"that you quite realize\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\nsay where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon?\"\n\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\n\n\"Speak!\" he cried menacingly.\n\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\n\n\"You will not speak?\"\n\n\"No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\nof what you say.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\n\n\"_Soit!_\" he said. \"Then I must speak for you.\"\n\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\n\n\"You? How can you speak? You do not know      \" he broke off abruptly.\n\nPoirot turned to face us. \"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist's shop,\nand purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr.\nInglethorp, for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\nRaikes's home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!\"\n\n\n\n\n",

We shouldn't have been here as soon as this even, if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you've been on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I'd laugh in his face.

He goes boldly to the village chemist's and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not employ the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence   no shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist's assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic!

His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his eyes   those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now, what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand. Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt. It was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof   such as the actual buying of the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr. Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in his clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred Inglethorp?"

        "raw text": " VIII.\nFRESH SUSPICIONS\n\n\nThere was a moment's stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\n\n\"My word,\" he cried, \"you're the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\"\n\n\"_Voil  !_ I have prepared a list of them   names and addresses. You must\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that.\" Japp lowered his voice. \"I'm much obliged to you. A\npretty mare's nest arresting him would have been.\" He turned to\nInglethorp. \"But, if you'll excuse me, sir, why couldn't you say all\nthis at the inquest?\"\n\n\"I will tell you why,\" interrupted Poirot. \"There was a certain\nrumour      \"\n\n\"A most malicious and utterly untrue one,\" interrupted Alfred\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\n\n\"And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\npresent. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Quite right.\" Inglethorp nodded. \"With my poor Emily not yet buried,\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\nstarted.\"\n\n\"Between you and me, sir,\" remarked Japp, \"I'd sooner have any amount\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn't been for Mr.\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\"\n\n\"I was foolish, no doubt,\" murmured Inglethorp. \"But you do not know,\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\" And he shot a\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Japp, turning briskly to John, \"I should like to see\nthe lady's bedroom, please, and after that I'll have a little chat with\nthe servants. Don't you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\nshow me the way.\"\n\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\n\n\"Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there   just this side of the baize\ndoor. Do not move till I come.\" Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\ntwo detectives.\n\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\nCynthia Murdoch's, everyone's room was in this left wing. Had that\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\nhappened.\n\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\n\n\"You have not stirred?\"\n\n\"No, I've stuck here like a rock. Nothing's happened.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Was he pleased, or disappointed? \"You've seen nothing at all?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you have probably heard something? A big bump   eh, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture\"   I know Poirot's gestures   \"with the\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!\"\n\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\nconsole him.\n\n\"Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp's with Mrs. Raikes than we\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\"\n\n\"Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" I said, looking out of the window. \"Here's Dr. Bauerstein. I\nbelieve you're right about that man, Poirot. I don't like him.\"\n\n\"He is clever,\" observed Poirot meditatively.\n\n\"Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\" And I\ndescribed the doctor's adventure. \"He looked a regular scarecrow!\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\"\n\n\"You saw him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course, he didn't want to come in   it was just after dinner   but\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\n\n\"What?\" Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \"Was Dr.\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?\"\n\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\n\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I expostulated, \"I never thought it would interest\nyou. I didn't know it was of any importance.\"\n\n\"Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\non Tuesday night   the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\nThat alters everything   everything!\"\n\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\nhimself: \"Yes, that alters everything   everything.\"\n\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\"_Allons!_\" he said. \"We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\"\n\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\n\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\nclue. May I take your motor?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. Do you mean at once?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\n\n\"Now, Poirot,\" I remarked resignedly, \"perhaps you will tell me what\nall this is about?\"\n\n\"Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\nthat at the inquest   but now it has a very different significance. We\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\ngo near the coffee   Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so.\" I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\n\n\"In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\" continued Poirot, \"I have been obliged\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\nbe doubly careful. Yes   doubly careful.\" He turned to me abruptly. \"Tell\nme, Hastings, you yourself   have you no suspicions of anybody?\"\n\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\n\n\"You couldn't call it a suspicion,\" I murmured. \"It's so utterly\nfoolish.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" urged Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind.\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I blurted out, \"it's absurd   but I suspect Miss Howard of\nnot telling all she knows!\"\n\n\"Miss Howard?\"\n\n\"Yes   you'll laugh at me      \"\n\n\"Not at all. Why should I?\"\n\n\"I can't help feeling,\" I continued blunderingly; \"that we've rather\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend,\" said Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my first\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\nand that   a convoy coming in unexpectedly   she had kindly offered to\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\ndisposes of that.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, rather nonplussed. \"Really,\" I continued, \"it's her\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\nsuspecting her. I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him. And\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\"\n\n\"You consider her vehemence unnatural?\"\n\n\"Y   es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\nsane on that point.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\n\n\"No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\"\n\n\"Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was   a very\nridiculous one, no doubt   that she had intended to poison him   and that,\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don't at\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\nridiculous to the last degree.\"\n\n\"Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\nHoward's having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Why, she was devoted to her!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Tcha! Tcha!\" cried Poirot irritably. \"You argue like a child. If Miss\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\npresent.\" He paused a minute, then went on. \"Now, to my way of\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard's being the\nmurderess.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\"\n\nI reflected.\n\n\"Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\nsame position, so I used her name instead.\"\n\n\"Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\nafternoon of her death may      \"\n\nBut Poirot's shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\n\n\"No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\nBut I can tell you this much   it was not in Miss Howard's favour.\"\n\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\nso positive about the matter.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, with a sigh, \"we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\"\n\nPoirot looked puzzled.\n\n\"What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\nsuspicion?\"\n\n\"Oh   ah   yes.\" He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \"By\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\"\n\n\"Certainly. What is it?\"\n\n\"Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\nto say this to him.    I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\n\"Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"' Nothing more.\nNothing less.\"\n\n\"   Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Is that\nright?\" I asked, much mystified.\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.\"\n\n\"Very well   but it's all extremely mysterious.\"\n\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\n\"Analytical Chemist.\"\n\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\nback again.\n\n\"There,\" he said. \"That is all my business.\"\n\n\"What were you doing there?\" I asked, in lively curiosity.\n\n\"I left something to be analysed.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what?\"\n\n\"The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\"\n\n\"But that has already been tested!\" I cried, stupefied. \"Dr. Bauerstein\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\nbeing strychnine in it.\"\n\n\"I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\" replied Poirot quietly.\n\n\"Well, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\"\n\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\n\nThis proceeding of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp's innocence had been so\ntriumphantly vindicated.\n\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\nplans.\n\n\"And really it's a great relief to think he's going, Hastings,\"\ncontinued my honest friend. \"It was bad enough before, when we thought\nhe'd done it, but I'm hanged if it isn't worse now, when we all feel\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we've\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\ndon't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\none doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\nthing's damned awkward! And I'm thankful he's had the tact to take\nhimself off. It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to\nhim. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He's welcome\nto her money.\"\n\n\"You'll be able to keep up the place all right?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father's\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\"\n\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp's approaching departure, we had the\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\n\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\nfashionable life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" was the topic of\nthe moment.\n\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\nundiscovered crimes?\n\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\nshe might have a few words with me.\n\n\"Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\"\n\n\"Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\nto-day perhaps?\" I nodded. \"Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. You have found one?\" My interest was aroused.\n\n\"No, not that, sir. But since then I've remembered what the young\ngentlemen\"   John and Lawrence were still the \"young gentlemen\" to\nDorcas   \"call the    dressing-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\nthem. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman      \"\n\n\"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promised.\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\nprying about, and asking questions. I don't hold with foreigners as a\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\nBelges isn't the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he's a most\npolite spoken gentleman.\"\n\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\nservant that is so fast dying out.\n\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\ngave him Dorcas's message.\n\n\"Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although   but no\nmatter   we will examine it all the same.\"\n\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\n\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\ngarment.\n\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\nexclamation.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\nwas a magnificent black beard.\n\n\"_Oh  !_\" said Poirot. \"_Oh  !_\" He turned it over in his hands,\nexamining it closely. \"New,\" he remarked. \"Yes, quite new.\"\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\nbusily polishing her silver.\n\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\n\n\"We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\nthey often used, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\nhave what the young gentlemen call    a dress-up night.' And very funny\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful. Most comic! I shall\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\ncalled it   a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\nhis hand, and    Mind, Dorcas,' he says,    you'll have to be very\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with\nyour head if I'm at all displeased with you!' Miss Cynthia, she was\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name   a Frenchified sort of\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You'd never have\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.\"\n\n\"These evenings must have been great fun,\" said Poirot genially. \"I\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?\"\n\n\"He did have a beard, sir,\" replied Dorcas, smiling. \"And well I know\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\nI'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know as\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly   though    tis messy getting it off\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\"\n\n\"So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\" said Poirot\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\n\n\"Do you think it is _the_ one?\" I whispered eagerly.\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"I do. You notice it had been trimmed?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and I found one\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\"\n\n\"Who put it in the chest, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Someone with a good deal of intelligence,\" remarked Poirot dryly. \"You\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\nof being intelligent at all.\"\n\nI acquiesced.\n\n\"There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\"\n\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \"you will be\ninvaluable.\"\n\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot's next words were not so\nwelcome.\n\n\"I must have an ally in the house,\" he observed reflectively.\n\n\"You have me,\" I protested.\n\n\"True, but you are not sufficient.\"\n\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\n\n\"You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. How about John?\"\n\n\"No, I think not.\"\n\n\"The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright,\" I said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Here comes Miss Howard,\" said Poirot suddenly. \"She is the very\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\nStill, we can but try.\"\n\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot's\nrequest for a few minutes' conversation.\n\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Poirot,\" said Miss Howard impatiently, \"what is it? Out\nwith it. I'm busy.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\" The lady nodded. \"And I told you I'd help you with\npleasure   to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot studied her seriously. \"Miss Howard, I will ask you one\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\"\n\n\"Never tell lies,\" replied Miss Howard.\n\n\"It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\nher husband?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked sharply. \"You needn't think your pretty\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I'll admit that it wasn't\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\"\n\n\"That is arsenic   not strychnine,\" said Poirot mildly.\n\n\"What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\njust as well as strychnine. If I'm convinced he did it, it doesn't\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.\"\n\n\"Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\" said Poirot quietly. \"I\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Miss Howard. \"Haven't I always told you the man\nis a villain? Haven't I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\nHaven't I always hated him like poison?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot. \"That bears out my little idea entirely.\"\n\n\"What little idea?\"\n\n\"Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\nof my friend's arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\nnonsense?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot curtly. \"Because your instinct is not against Mr.\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\nit. It tells you more   shall I go on?\"\n\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\nmovement of the hand.\n\n\"Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\ntells you another name      \"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \"Don't\nsay it! Oh, don't say it! It isn't true! It can't be true. I don't know\nwhat put such a wild   such a dreadful   idea into my head!\"\n\n\"I am right, am I not?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can't be\nso   it's too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\n\n\"Don't ask me about it,\" continued Miss Howard, \"because I shan't tell\nyou. I won't admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\nthing.\"\n\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\n\n\"I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\nAnd I   I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\ncommon end.\"\n\n\"Don't ask me to help you, because I won't. I wouldn't lift a finger\nto   to      \" She faltered.\n\n\"You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing   but you will\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\nthing that I want of you.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"You will watch!\"\n\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\n\n\"Yes, I can't help doing that. I am always watching   always hoping I\nshall be proved wrong.\"\n\n\"If we are wrong, well and good,\" said Poirot. \"No one will be more\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\nHoward, on whose side are you then?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know      \"\n\n\"Come now.\"\n\n\"It could be hushed up.\"\n\n\"There must be no hushing up.\"\n\n\"But Emily herself      \" She broke off.\n\n\"Miss Howard,\" said Poirot gravely, \"this is unworthy of you.\"\n\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\" She\nflung her head up proudly. \"_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\" And with these words,\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\n\n\"There,\" said Poirot, looking after her, \"goes a very valuable ally.\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"Instinct is a marvellous thing,\" mused Poirot. \"It can neither be\nexplained nor ignored.\"\n\n\"You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\" I\nobserved coldly. \"Perhaps you don't realize that _I_ am still in the\ndark.\"\n\n\"Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Yes. Enlighten me, will you?\"\n\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\n\n\"No, my friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, look here, why not?\"\n\n\"Two is enough for a secret.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\"\n\n\"I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\na question of ideas.\"\n\n\"Still, it would be interesting to know.\"\n\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\n\n\"You see,\" he said sadly, \"_you_ have no instincts.\"\n\n\"It was intelligence you were requiring just now,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"The two often go together,\" said Poirot enigmatically.\n\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\nimportant discoveries   as no doubt I should   I would keep them to myself,\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\n\nThere are times when it is one's duty to assert oneself.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IX.\nDR. BAUERSTEIN\n\n\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot's message to\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\ngrudge against my friend's high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\n\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\nLawrence's reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\nhim.\n\n\"I've been looking for you,\" I remarked untruthfully.\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Yes. The truth is, I've got a message for you   from Poirot.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He told me to wait until I was alone with you,\" I said, dropping my\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\ncreating an atmosphere.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\nany idea of what I was about to say?\n\n\"This is the message.\" I dropped my voice still lower. \"   Find the extra\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.'\"\n\n\"What on earth does he mean?\" Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\nastonishment.\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Do you?\"\n\nI was compelled to shake my head.\n\n\"What extra coffee-cup?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"He'd better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\ncoffee-cups. It's their business, not mine. I don't know anything about\nthe coffee-cups, except that we've got some that are never used, which\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You're not a connoisseur, are you,\nHastings?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china   it's pure delight to\nhandle it, or even to look at it.\"\n\n\"Well, what am I to tell Poirot?\"\n\n\"Tell him I don't know what he's talking about. It's double Dutch to\nme.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\nback.\n\n\"I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\"\n\n\"   Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Are you sure\nyou don't know what it means?\" I asked him earnestly.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said musingly, \"I don't. I   I wish I did.\"\n\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\nseated at the table.\n\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\nlittle idea\"   Poirot's \"little ideas\" were becoming a perfect\nbyword   \"and would like to ask one or two questions.\"\n\n\"Of me? Certainly.\"\n\n\"You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\nit was bolted, you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly it was bolted,\" replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \"I\nsaid so at the inquest.\"\n\n\"Bolted?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She looked perplexed.\n\n\"I mean,\" explained Poirot, \"you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\nlocked?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don't know. I said bolted, meaning that\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\nwere found bolted on the inside.\"\n\n\"Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\nbeen locked?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\nInglethorp's room, whether that door was bolted or not?\"\n\n\"I   I believe it was.\"\n\n\"But you did not see it?\"\n\n\"No. I   never looked.\"\n\n\"But _I_ did,\" interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \"I happened to notice\nthat it _was_ bolted.\"\n\n\"Ah, that settles it.\" And Poirot looked crestfallen.\n\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \"little ideas\"\nhad come to naught.\n\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\nstiffly.\n\n\"You are annoyed, is it not so?\" he asked anxiously, as we walked\nthrough the park.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.\"\n\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\n\n\"I gave Lawrence your message,\" I said.\n\n\"And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\"\n\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\n\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\"\n\n\"She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\"\n\n\"Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\"\n\n\"I am sure she would be delighted. It's an interesting little place.\"\n\n\"Does she go there every day?\"\n\n\"She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\nThose are her only times off.\"\n\n\"I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\nCynthia is clever   oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\"\n\n\"Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\"\n\n\"Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\nhave very strong poisons there?\"\n\n\"Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\nthe key before leaving the room.\"\n\n\"Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\"\n\n\"No, right the other side of the room. Why?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\"\n\nWe had reached the cottage.\n\n\"No. I think I'll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\nthrough the woods.\"\n\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\n\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\nfar off.\n\nI yawned again.\n\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \"I tell you\nI won't have it!\"\n\nI woke up with a start.\n\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\n\n\"I tell you, Mary, I won't have it.\"\n\nMary's voice came, cool and liquid:\n\n\"Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\"\n\n\"It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she shrugged her shoulders, \"if it is only village gossip that\nyou mind!\"\n\n\"But it isn't. I've had enough of the fellow hanging about. He's a\nPolish Jew, anyway.\"\n\n\"A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\"   she looked\nat him   \"stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\"\n\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\nrose to John's face in a crimson tide.\n\n\"Mary!\"\n\n\"Well?\" Her tone did not change.\n\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\n\n\"Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\nexpress wishes?\"\n\n\"If I choose.\"\n\n\"You defy me?\"\n\n\"No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?\"\n\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he said, in an unsteady voice.\n\n\"You see!\" said Mary quietly. \"You _do_ see, don't you, that _you_ have\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\"\n\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\n\n\"No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\" he said unsteadily. He stretched\nout his hands. \"Mary      \"\n\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\n\n\"None!\"\n\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\narm.\n\n\"Mary\"   his voice was very quiet now   \"are you in love with this fellow\nBauerstein?\"\n\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\n\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\n\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\n\n\"Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\"\n\n\"He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\nworld it is, though!\"\n\n\"You find it so?\" I asked.\n\n\"Good Lord, yes! There's this terrible business to start with. Scotland\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\nwhere they won't turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\nthe country   damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\nTussaud's chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\nPretty thick, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Cheer up, John!\" I said soothingly. \"It can't last for ever.\"\n\n\"Can't it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\nhold up our heads again.\"\n\n\"No, no, you're getting morbid on the subject.\"\n\n\"Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there's\nworse than that.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nJohn lowered his voice:\n\n\"Have you ever thought, Hastings   it's a nightmare to me   who did it? I\ncan't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\nBecause   because   who could have done it? Now Inglethorp's out of the\nway, there's no one else; no one, I mean, except   one of us.\"\n\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\nsurely it must be so, unless      -\n\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\nlight increased. Poirot's mysterious doings, his hints   they all fitted\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\nwhat a relief for us all.\n\n\"No, John,\" I said, \"it isn't one of us. How could it be?\"\n\n\"I know, but, still, who else is there?\"\n\n\"Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" I whispered.\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"But what earthly interest could he have in my mother's death?\"\n\n\"That I don't see,\" I confessed, \"but I'll tell you this: Poirot thinks\nso.\"\n\n\"Poirot? Does he? How do you know?\"\n\nI told him of Poirot's intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\n\n\"He said twice:    That alters everything.' And I've been thinking. You\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn't it possible that, as\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\ninto the coffee in passing?\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said John. \"It would have been very risky.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it was possible.\"\n\n\"And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don't\nthink that will wash.\"\n\nBut I had remembered something else.\n\n\"You're quite right. That wasn't how it was done. Listen.\" And I then\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\n\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\n\n\"But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's the point. I didn't see it either until now. Don't\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed   that's just it! If\nBauerstein's the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\nsample   except Poirot,\" I added, with belated recognition.\n\n\"Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won't disguise?\"\n\n\"Well, we've only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\nHe's admittedly one of the world's greatest toxicologists      \"\n\n\"One of the world's greatest what? Say it again.\"\n\n\"He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\" I explained. \"Well,\nmy idea is, that perhaps he's found some way of making strychnine\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\"\n\n\"H'm, yes, that might be,\" said John. \"But look here, how could he have\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn't downstairs?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't,\" I admitted reluctantly.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\n\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\npoison.\n\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\nwoman's weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\n\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\n\nYes, it all fitted in.\n\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested \"hushing it up.\" Now I understood\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: \"Emily herself      \" And in my heart I\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\nof Cavendish.\n\n\"There's another thing,\" said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\nof his voice made me start guiltily. \"Something which makes me doubt if\nwhat you say can be true.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\n\n\"Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn't have\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\nheart disease.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said doubtfully. \"But we don't know. Perhaps he thought it\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's possible,\" admitted John. \"Still,\" he added, \"I'm blest if\nI can see what his motive could have been.\"\n\nI trembled.\n\n\"Look here,\" I said, \"I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\nthis is in confidence.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course   that goes without saying.\"\n\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\n\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\nand told her of Poirot's wish to visit the dispensary.\n\n\"Of course! I'd love him to see it. He'd better come to tea there one\nday. I must fix it up with him. He's such a dear little man! But he\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\nput it in again, because he said it wasn't straight.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"It's quite a mania with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it?\"\n\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\n\n\"Mr. Hastings.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"After tea, I want to talk to you.\"\n\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\nto me to wonder about the girl's future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\nprobably insist on her making her home with them   at any rate until the\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\nto let her go.\n\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\n\n\"Confound those detectives! I can't think what they're after! They've\nbeen in every room in the house   turning things inside out, and upside\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\"\n\n\"Lot of Paul Prys,\" grunted Miss Howard.\n\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\n\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\n\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\ninto the woods together.\n\n\"Well?\" I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\nthe leafy screen.\n\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\nto quivering gold.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings   you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\"\n\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\n\n\"I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\nsuppose she forgot, or didn't think she was likely to die   anyway, I am\n_not_ provided for! And I don't know what to do. Do you think I ought\nto go away from here at once?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no! They don't want to part with you, I'm sure.\"\n\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\nThen she said: \"Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\"\n\n\"Hates you?\" I cried, astonished.\n\nCynthia nodded.\n\n\"Yes. I don't know why, but she can't bear me; and _he_ can't, either.\"\n\n\"There I know you're wrong,\" I said warmly. \"On the contrary, John is\nvery fond of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes   _John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it's rather horrid when no one loves\nyou, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But they do, Cynthia dear,\" I said earnestly. \"I'm sure you are\nmistaken. Look, there is John   and Miss Howard      \"\n\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. \"Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn't be unkind to a fly. But\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\nher to, but she doesn't want me, and   and   I don't know what to do.\"\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\n\nI don't know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\nawkwardly:\n\n\"Marry me, Cynthia.\"\n\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\n\n\"Don't be silly!\"\n\nI was a little annoyed.\n\n\"I'm not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\nmy wife.\"\n\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\n\"funny dear.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly sweet of you,\" she said, \"but you know you don't want\nto!\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. I've got      \"\n\n\"Never mind what you've got. You don't really want to   and I don't\neither.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, that settles it,\" I said stiffly. \"But I don't see\nanything to laugh at. There's nothing funny about a proposal.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Cynthia. \"Somebody might accept you next time.\nGood-bye, you've cheered me up _very_ much.\"\n\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\nthrough the trees.\n\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\nunsatisfactory.\n\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\n\"Apartments\" card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\ntapped on the door.\n\nAn old woman came and opened it.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said pleasantly. \"Is Dr. Bauerstein in?\"\n\nShe stared at me.\n\n\"Haven't you heard?\"\n\n\"Heard what?\"\n\n\"About him.\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"He's took.\"\n\n\"Took? Dead?\"\n\n\"No, took by the perlice.\"\n\n\"By the police!\" I gasped. \"Do you mean they've arrested him?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, and      \"\n\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " X.\nTHE ARREST\n\n\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\n\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\n\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated   otherwise I should have\nheard some hint of it.\n\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein's arrest from her. It would be announced in\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\n\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\n\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\n\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\n\n\"Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn't believe it at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\ngenerally known to-morrow.\"\n\nJohn reflected.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he said at last, \"we won't say anything at present. There\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\"\n\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\nThere was a column of mere padding about \"The Styles Poisoning Case,\"\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\nmight be further arrests to come.\n\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\n\n\"_Bonjour, mon ami!_\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\ndragged him into the room. \"I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Poirot, \"I do not know what you are talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein's arrest, of course,\" I answered impatiently.\n\n\"Is Bauerstein arrested, then?\"\n\n\"Did you not know it?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\" But, pausing a moment, he added: \"Still,\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\ncoast.\"\n\n\"The coast?\" I asked, puzzled. \"What has that got to do with it?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Surely, it is obvious!\"\n\n\"Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, of course,\" replied Poirot, smiling. \"But we were\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\"\n\n\"Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp      \"\n\n\"What?\" cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \"Dr.\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Well, no one exactly told me,\" I confessed. \"But he is arrested.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"Espionage?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\" replied\nPoirot placidly.\n\n\"But   but I thought you thought so too?\"\n\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\n\"that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"Have you never suspected it?\"\n\n\"It never entered my head.\"\n\n\"It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\"\n\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I never thought of such a thing.\"\n\n\"He is, of course, a German by birth,\" said Poirot thoughtfully,\n\"though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\nyears ago. A very clever man   a Jew, of course.\"\n\n\"The blackguard!\" I cried indignantly.\n\n\"Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\nlose. I admire the man myself.\"\n\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot's philosophical way.\n\n\"And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\nall over the country!\" I cried indignantly.\n\n\"Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\" remarked Poirot.\n\"So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\nother vagaries of the doctor's passed unobserved.\"\n\n\"Then you think he never really cared for her?\" I asked eagerly   rather\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\n\n\"That, of course, I cannot say, but   shall I tell you my own private\nopinion, Hastings?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" I could not disguise my pleasure.\n\n\"I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate      \n\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\n\n\"On top of the wardrobe.\" Then she hurriedly left the room.\n\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\n\n\"Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial   J. or L.?\"\n\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\nPoirot's attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\nParkson's, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\nto \"   (the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\nMary, Essex.\"\n\n\"It might be T., or it might be L.,\" I said, after studying the thing\nfor a minute or two. \"It certainly isn't a J.\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \"I, also, am of\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\"\n\n\"Where did it come from?\" I asked curiously. \"Is it important?\"\n\n\"Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\nbeen successful.\"\n\n\"What did she mean by    On the top of the wardrobe'?\"\n\n\"She meant,\" replied Poirot promptly, \"that she found it on top of a\nwardrobe.\"\n\n\"A funny place for a piece of brown paper,\" I mused.\n\n\"Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I asked earnestly, \"have you made up your mind about this\ncrime?\"\n\n\"Yes   that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless      \" With\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\ncalling out in French in his excitement: \"Mademoiselle Dorcas,\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s'il vous pla  t!_\"\n\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\n\n\"My good Dorcas, I have an idea   a little idea   if it should prove\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp's bell?\"\n\nDorcas looked very surprised.\n\n\"Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don't know how you came\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\"\n\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\nthe morning-room.\n\n\"See you, one should not ask for outside proof   no, reason should be\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\nleap!\"\n\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\n\n\"What is your remarkable little friend doing?\" asked a voice behind me,\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\nI. \"What is it all about?\"\n\n\"Really, I can't tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\nyou see!\"\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"How ridiculous! He's going out of the gate. Isn't he coming back\nto-day?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've given up trying to guess what he'll do next.\"\n\n\"Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\"\n\n\"I honestly don't know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\nin his madness.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\nseemed grave, almost sad.\n\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\n\n\"You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\"\n\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn't thought       But again\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings,\" she said, \"do you think I and my husband are happy\ntogether?\"\n\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it's not\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\n\n\"Well,\" she said quietly, \"whether it is your business or not, I will\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.\"\n\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\n\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\n\n\"You don't know anything about me, do you?\" she asked. \"Where I come\nfrom, who I was before I married John   anything, in fact? Well, I will\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\nthink   yes, I am sure you are kind.\"\n\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\nyoung man.\n\n\"My father was English,\" said Mrs. Cavendish, \"but my mother was a\nRussian.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I said, \"now I understand      \"\n\n\"Understand what?\"\n\n\"A hint of something foreign   different   that there has always been about\nyou.\"\n\n\"My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don't know, because I never\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\nsome tragedy connected with her death   she took an overdose of some\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life   I loved it.\"\n\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\n\n\"Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\" She shuddered. \"You will understand\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\"\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \"And then I met\nJohn Cavendish.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You can imagine that, from my aunts' point of view, it was a very good\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\nmonotony of my life.\"\n\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls    in love' with\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so   we were married.\"\n\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\n\n\"I think   I am sure   he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He   it is not a pleasing\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth   tired of me very soon.\" I must\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \"Oh, yes, he\ndid! Not that it matters now   now that we've come to the parting of the\nways.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe answered quietly:\n\n\"I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\"\n\n\"You and John are not going to live here?\"\n\n\"John may live here, but I shall not.\"\n\n\"You are going to leave him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\n\n\"Perhaps   because I want to be   free!\"\n\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\nof forests, untrodden lands   and a realization of what freedom would\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\n\n\"You don't know, you don't know, how this hateful place has been prison\nto me!\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said, \"but   but don't do anything rash.\"\n\n\"Oh, rash!\" Her voice mocked at my prudence.\n\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\n\n\"You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\"\n\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\nexpression.\n\n\"John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" I asked feebly.\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of the arrest?\"\n\n\"What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\nhad told John.\"\n\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\ncare, or did she not?\n\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\n\n\"These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\nmoving   thank you, Mr. Hastings.\" And she walked quietly past me out of\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\n\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\npart with that icy unconcern.\n\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\n\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence   or rather\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp's\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\nof Mrs. Inglethorp's correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\nabandoned.\n\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\n\n\"Gone to London again?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster.    To see a\nyoung lady's dispensary,' he said.\"\n\n\"Silly ass!\" I ejaculated. \"I told him Wednesday was the one day she\nwasn't there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur.\"\n\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\n\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\nsee him.\n\n\"No, I don't think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked. \"I could go if there's anything special.\"\n\n\"It's nothing much, but   well, if you are going, will you tell him      \" he\ndropped his voice to a whisper   \"I think I've found the extra\ncoffee-cup!\"\n\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but now my\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\n\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\n\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\n\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\nsprang up at my entrance.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked solicitously. \"You are not ill, I trust?\"\n\n\"No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\"\n\n\"Whether to catch the criminal or not?\" I asked facetiously.\n\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\n\n\"   To speak or not to speak,' as your so great Shakespeare says,    that\nis the question.'\"\n\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\n\n\"You are not serious, Poirot?\"\n\n\"I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\nthe balance.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"A woman's happiness, _mon ami_,\" he said gravely.\n\nI did not quite know what to say.\n\n\"The moment has come,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"and I do not know\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!\" And he tapped himself proudly\non the breast.\n\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\neffect, I gave him Lawrence's message.\n\n\"Aha!\" he cried. \"So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\nLawrence of yours!\"\n\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence's intelligence; but I\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia's days off.\n\n\"It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\neverything in the kindest way.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, that's all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\nanother day.\"\n\nI told him about the letter.\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" he said. \"I always had hopes of that letter. But\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\"\nHe tapped his forehead. \"These little grey cells. It is    up to them'   as\nyou say over here.\" Then, suddenly, he asked: \"Are you a judge of\nfinger-marks, my friend?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, rather surprised, \"I know that there are no two\nfinger-marks alike, but that's as far as my science goes.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\nlaid on the table.\n\n\"I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\"\n\nI studied the proofs attentively.\n\n\"All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man's\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady's; they are\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\"   I paused for\nsome time   \"there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\nvery distinctly, are No. 1's.\"\n\n\"Overlapping the others?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You recognize them beyond fail?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; they are identical.\"\n\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\nagain.\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that as usual, you are not going to explain?\"\n\n\"On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\ncomplicated.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks   it remains to\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.\"\n\n\"Go on   I am really excited.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\nCross Hospital at Tadminster   which sounds like the house that Jack\nbuilt!\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"But what were Lawrence Cavendish's\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\nday we were there!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he did!\"\n\n\"Impossible! We were all together the whole time.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\njoin you on the balcony.\"\n\n\"I'd forgotten that,\" I admitted. \"But it was only for a moment.\"\n\n\"Long enough.\"\n\n\"Long enough for what?\"\n\nPoirot's smile became rather enigmatical.\n\n\"Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\nvery natural interest and curiosity.\"\n\nOur eyes met. Poirot's were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"what was in this particular little bottle?\"\n\nPoirot looked out of the window.\n\n\"Hydro-chloride of strychnine,\" he said, over his shoulder, continuing\nto hum.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\nexpected that answer.\n\n\"They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little   only\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to take this photograph?\"\n\n\"I dropped my hat from the balcony,\" explained Poirot simply. \"Visitors\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia's colleague had to go down and fetch it\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Then you knew what you were going to find?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\nimportant discovery.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Poirot. \"But one thing does strike me. No doubt\nit has struck you too.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\nMrs. Inglethorp's tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\ndo not like confusion.\"\n\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\nstuck his head in.\n\n\"There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\"\n\n\"A lady?\"\n\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\nwas standing in the doorway.\n\n\"I have been visiting an old woman in the village,\" she explained, \"and\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\ncall for you.\"\n\n\"Alas, madame,\" said Poirot, \"I thought you had come to honour me with\na visit!\"\n\n\"I will some day, if you ask me,\" she promised him, smiling.\n\n\"That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\"   she\nstarted ever so slightly   \"remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\nservice.\"\n\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\n\n\"Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\"\n\n\"Enchanted, madame.\"\n\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot's eyes.\n\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\nsome great giant sighing.\n\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\ncame to us that something was wrong.\n\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\n\n\"Oh, m'am! Oh, m'am! I don't know how to tell you      \"\n\n\"What is it, Dorcas?\" I asked impatiently. \"Tell us at once.\"\n\n\"It's those wicked detectives. They've arrested him   they've arrested\nMr. Cavendish!\"\n\n\"Arrested Lawrence?\" I gasped.\n\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas's eyes.\n\n\"No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence   Mr. John.\"\n\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot's eyes.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XI.\n\nTHE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\n\n\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\ntwo months later.\n\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\npassionately on her husband's side, scorning the mere idea of his\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\n\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\njealousy have      \"\n\n\"Jealousy?\" I queried.\n\n\"Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\nhim.\"\n\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\nspeak. With his tenderness for \"a woman's happiness,\" I felt glad that\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\n\n\"Even now,\" I said, \"I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\"\n\nPoirot grinned.\n\n\"I know you did.\"\n\n\"But John! My old friend John!\"\n\n\"Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend,\" observed Poirot\nphilosophically. \"You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\"\n\n\"I must say I think you might have given me a hint.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\nfriend.\"\n\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\non to John what I believed to be Poirot's views concerning Bauerstein.\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\n\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\nlikely to be acquitted.\n\n\"But, Poirot      \" I protested.\n\n\"Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\nlink      \" He shook his head gravely.\n\n\"When did you first suspect John Cavendish?\" I asked, after a minute or\ntwo.\n\n\"Did you not suspect him at all?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\nat the inquest?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife   and you remember,\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest   it must be either Lawrence or\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish's conduct was just as\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\nwas explained quite naturally.\"\n\n\"So,\" I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \"it was John who quarrelled\nwith his mother that afternoon?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And you have known this all along?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish's behaviour could only be explained that\nway.\"\n\n\"And yet you say he may be acquitted?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\ntrial. And   ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.\"\n\n\"I say, that's playing it a bit low down,\" I protested.\n\n\"Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\nand we must use any means in our power   otherwise he will slip through\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\"   he\nsmiled broadly   \"it will probably be as a witness for the defence.\"\n\nI could hardly believe my ears.\n\n\"It is quite _en r  gle_,\" continued Poirot. \"Strangely enough, I can\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\ndid not destroy that will.\"\n\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\nduly committed for trial.\n\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\nPoirot being included in the family party.\n\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\nthem continually.\n\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot's nerves grew worse and\nworse. That \"last link\" he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\nif John were not acquitted?\n\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\nBailey, charged with \"The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\" and\npleaded \"Not Guilty.\"\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\nhim.\n\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\n\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\n\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\nneighbouring farmer's wife. This having come to his stepmother's ears,\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist's shop, wearing a\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\nanother man   to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp's husband, of whom he had been\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\nbefore her marriage, but   and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\nforefinger   the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\nformer one; or   this seemed to him more likely   she may have had an idea\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\nvalid.\n\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp   a most brilliant officer   of the\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\nchemist's to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner's guilt.\n\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\n\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\nquestions.\n\n\"I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\nto \"Mr. Inglethorp.\" Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\ncross-examined.\n\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\n\nThe gardeners' evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\nand then Dorcas was called.\n\nDorcas, faithful to her \"young gentlemen,\" denied strenuously that it\ncould have been John's voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\ngive evidence against her husband.\n\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\n\n\"In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson's?\"\n\nDorcas shook her head.\n\n\"I don't remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\nfrom home part of June.\"\n\n\"In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\nwould be done with it?\"\n\n\"It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\"\n\n\"By you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\nwho would attend to anything like that.\"\n\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\nquestioned as to the parcel.\n\n\"Don't remember. Lots of parcels come. Can't remember one special one.\"\n\n\"You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\nor whether it was put in his room?\"\n\n\"Don't think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\nwas.\"\n\n\"Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\"\n\n\"No, don't think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\"\n\n\"I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\npaper?\" He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\nin the morning-room at Styles.\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"How did you come to look for it?\"\n\n\"The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Where did you eventually discover it?\"\n\n\"On the top of   of   a wardrobe.\"\n\n\"On top of the prisoner's wardrobe?\"\n\n\"I   I believe so.\"\n\n\"Did you not find it yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you must know where you found it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was on the prisoner's wardrobe.\"\n\n\"That is better.\"\n\nAn assistant from Parkson's, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \"L. Cavendish,\nEsq., Styles Court.\"\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\n\n\"Where was the letter written from?\"\n\n\"From Styles Court.\"\n\n\"The same address to which you sent the parcel?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the letter came from there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I   I don't understand.\"\n\n\"How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\npostmark?\"\n\n\"No   but      \"\n\n\"Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\npostmark?\"\n\n\"Y   es.\"\n\n\"In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\"\n\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\nsignified that he was satisfied.\n\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp's door.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\n\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\n\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\ncounsel.\n\n\"That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn't!\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said consolingly, \"it will be the other way about to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \"Mr.\nHastings, you do not think   surely it could not have been Lawrence   Oh,\nno, that could not be!\"\n\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Poirot appreciatively. \"He is a clever man, that Sir\nErnest.\"\n\n\"Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\"\n\n\"I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\nagainst John   and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\"\n\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\n\n\"Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\nsearched the prisoner's room, during his temporary absence from the\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\nMr. Inglethorp\"   these were exhibited   \"secondly, this phial.\"\n\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist's assistant, a\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: \"Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.\"\n\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp's cheque book, and on being reversed\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: \". . . erything of which I die\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\" This placed\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\nthe deceased lady's husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\n\nBut Sir Ernest's cross-examination was yet to come.\n\n\"What day was it when you searched the prisoner's room?\"\n\n\"Tuesday, the 24th of July.\"\n\n\"Exactly a week after the tragedy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\ndrawer unlocked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\nto find?\"\n\n\"He might have stowed them there in a hurry.\"\n\n\"But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\nor light?\"\n\n\"Heavyish.\"\n\n\"In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.\"\n\n\"Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\nunaware of their presence?\"\n\n\"I should not think it likely.\"\n\n\"But it is possible?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes   poor Mary, that must have been bitter\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\n\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\nto Mr. Philips' questions, he denied having ordered anything from\nParkson's in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\nWales.\n\nInstantly, Sir Ernest's chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\n\n\"You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson's on June 29th?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\ninherit Styles Court?\"\n\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence's pale face.\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\n\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client's anger.\n\n\"Answer my question, if you please.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Lawrence quietly, \"that I should.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by you    suppose'? Your brother has no children. You\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's better,\" said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \"And\nyou'd inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Really, Sir Ernest,\" protested the judge, \"these questions are not\nrelevant.\"\n\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\n\n\"On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you   while you happened to be alone for a few seconds   unlock the\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\"\n\n\"I   I   may have done so.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that you did do so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\n\n\"Did you examine one bottle in particular?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.\"\n\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\n\n\"N   o   I am sure I didn't.\"\n\n\"Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?\"\n\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\n\n\"I   I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\"\n\n\"I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then why did you take it up?\"\n\n\"I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\"\n\n\"Ah! So poisons    naturally interest' you, do they? Still, you waited to\nbe alone before gratifying that    interest' of yours?\"\n\n\"That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\njust the same.\"\n\n\"Still, as it happens, the others were not there?\"\n\n\"No, but      \"\n\n\"In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\nof minutes, and it happened   I say, it happened   to be during those two\nminutes that you displayed your    natural interest' in Hydro-chloride of\nStrychnine?\"\n\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\n\n\"I   I      \"\n\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\n\n\"I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\n\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\nsilence.\n\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \"Alfred Inglethorp\" in the\nchemist's poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\nit might be the prisoner's hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether's speech in opening the case for the defence was\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\nprisoner's room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson's. The quarrel which\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\nexaggerated.\n\nHis learned friend   Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips   had\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner's head that\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\nquarrels.\n\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\nentered the chemist's shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\nMarston's Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\nas evidence.\n\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\nrevoked by his stepmother's remarriage. He would call evidence to show\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\nquite a new view of the case.\n\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\n\nHe would now call the prisoner.\n\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest's\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\n\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\n\n\"I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether's insinuations against my brother. My\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\"\n\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John's\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\n\nThen the cross-examination began.\n\n\"I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\nnot really the case.\"\n\n\"Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\nconversation   fragments which you must have recognized?\"\n\n\"I did not recognize them.\"\n\n\"Your memory must be unusually short!\"\n\n\"No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\npaid very little attention to my mother's actual words.\"\n\nMr. Philips' incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\npassed on to the subject of the note.\n\n\"You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\nhand-writing   carelessly disguised?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\nchemist's shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"No, that is a lie.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp's clothes, with\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there   and signed the\nregister in his name!\"\n\n\"That is absolutely untrue.\"\n\n\"Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\njury,\" said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\nperjury.\n\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\n\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\n\n\"What is it, Poirot?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\"\n\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\n\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary's offer of\ntea.\n\n\"No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\"\n\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\n\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\n\n\"No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\nneeded that more than now!\"\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" I asked.\n\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\nup edifice.\n\n\"It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\nhigh, but I cannot\"   thump   \"find\"   thump   \" that last link of which I\nspoke to you.\"\n\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\n\n\"It is done   so! By placing   one card   on another   with\nmathematical   precision!\"\n\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\ntrick.\n\n\"What a steady hand you've got,\" I remarked. \"I believe I've only seen\nyour hand shake once.\"\n\n\"On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\" observed Poirot,\nwith great placidity.\n\n\"Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\nmust say      \"\n\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\nkeenest agony.\n\n\"Good heavens, Poirot!\" I cried. \"What is the matter? Are you taken\nill?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he gasped. \"It is   it is   that I have an idea!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, much relieved. \"One of your    little ideas'?\"\n\n\"Ah, _ma foi_, no!\" replied Poirot frankly. \"This time it is an idea\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you   _you_, my friend, have given it to me!\"\n\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\n\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\nout:    A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!'\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\"\n\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\ngesture of despair.\n\n\"He'll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\nround the corner!\"\n\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\n\n\"What can be the matter?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I don't know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I expect he will be back before dinner.\"\n\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XII.\nTHE LAST LINK\n\n\nPoirot's abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o'clock a\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\n\n\"Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _r  union_ in the\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.\"\n\nMary smiled sadly.\n\n\"You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\nway.\"\n\n\"You are too amiable, madame.\"\n\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\nforward chairs as he did so.\n\n\"Miss Howard   here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\"\n\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\n\n\"If that man comes into the house, I leave it!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\n\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\n\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\n\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\nbromide powders.\n\n\"To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\nrecognize it for what it was   a piece torn from a green land armlet.\"\n\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\n\n\"Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land   Mrs.\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\ndeceased's room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\nCynthia's room.\"\n\n\"But that door was bolted on the inside!\" I cried.\n\n\"When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish's armlet. Also, at the inquest,\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish's door. I myself, in company\nwith the police, went to the deceased's room, and whilst there I,\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased's room when the\nalarm was given.\"\n\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\n\n\"I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\nmother-in-law's room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room,\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl's\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\nInglethorp's door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\narrived with the rest, but   and this is significant   I can find no one\nwho saw her come from the other wing.\" He looked at Mary Cavendish. \"Am\nI right, madame?\"\n\nShe bowed her head.\n\n\"Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\ninnocence.\"\n\n\"In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\nsignificance.\"\n\n\"The will!\" cried Lawrence. \"Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\nwill?\"\n\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\n\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is only one person who could possibly\nhave destroyed that will   Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" I exclaimed. \"She had only made it out that very\nafternoon!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\"\n\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\n\n\"The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\nMrs. Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\ndestroy some important document   possibly a will. So the discovery of\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\n\n\"Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o'clock, Dorcas\noverheard her mistress saying angrily:    You need not think that any\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\"\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\no'clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas,    I don't know what to\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.' At four\no'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\no'clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\nshock.\n\n\"Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\nwas convinced was correct. The second    scandal' she spoke of was not\nthe same as the first   and it concerned herself!\n\n\"Let us reconstruct. At four o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife   who, by the way,\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\nAt five o'clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\nagitation, with a slip of paper      a letter,' Dorcas thinks   in her hand,\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o'clock, something has\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\nthat something?\n\n\"As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\nof sentiment?\n\n\"One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\nstood her husband's desk   locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else   that slip of\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\nwas a written proof of her own husband's infidelity. She demanded it\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been lost\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\nimportant papers in this particular case.\n\n\"Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room.\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\nMademoiselle Cynthia's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\n\n\"But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\"\n\n\"Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Drugged?\"\n\n\"_Mais, oui!_\"\n\n\"You remember\"   he addressed us collectively again   \"that through all the\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned   which I did not\nbelieve   or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\n\n\"With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\neach cup, and had them analysed   with no result. I had counted the cups\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\nmistaken.\n\n\"Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\nusual   or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp's room.\n\n\"I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\n   salt' on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\nInglethorp's room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\nsent it to be analysed.\"\n\n\"But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\" said Lawrence\nquickly.\n\n\"Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\nnarcotic.\"\n\n\"For a narcotic?\"\n\n\"Yes. Here is the analyst's report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d'heure_ in\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word    Poison'!\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp's death lay at her door. She\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\ndoing.\n\n\"We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\"\n\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\nface.\n\n\"All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\nI understand now      \"\n\n\"What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\"\n\n\"I see everything now,\" said Lawrence. \"The drugged cocoa, taken on top\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\"\n\n\"What?\" The cry of surprise was universal.\n\n\"No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\nInglethorp's room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\nplayed her the same trick.\n\n\"What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\nbetween seven and nine o'clock that evening. What third medium was\nthere   a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?\" Poirot looked round the\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. \"Her medicine!\"\n\n\"Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\ntonic?\" I cried.\n\n\"There was no need to introduce it. It was already there   in the\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\n\n\"   The following prescription has become famous in text books:\n\n\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\n\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\n\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\n\n          Fiat Mistura\n\n\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\n\n\"Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins' prescription, but\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp's medicine was always\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\n\n\"Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\nInglethorp's bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\nhome, so that the last   and fatal   dose was actually taken twenty-four\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\nto that delay that the final proof   the last link of the chain   is now in\nmy hands.\"\n\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\n\n\"A letter in the murderer's own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\nbut not the manner of it.\"\n\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\nclearing his throat, read:\n\nDearest Evelyn:\n\n       You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right   only it\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There's a\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\n    circumspect. A false step      '\n\n\n\"Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\nknow this hand-writing and      \"\n\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\n\n\"You devil! How did you get it?\"\n\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\n\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_,\" said Poirot, with a flourish, \"let me\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\"\n\n\n\n\n",

To begin with, the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish's armlet. Also, at the inquest, Mrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall of the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish's door. I myself, in company with the police, went to the deceased's room, and whilst there I, apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all. This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy.

She hurries out into the passage, for the servants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings. What can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl's room, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp's door.

            {
                "character": "Hercule Poirot",
                "dialogue": "The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade. Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper was thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs. Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document   possibly a will. So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took place after, and not before the making of the will. Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea. I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o'clock, Dorcas overheard her mistress saying angrily: I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were addressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five o'clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the standpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, At four o'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five o'clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great shock. Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I was convinced was correct. The second    scandal' she spoke of was not the same as the first   and it concerned herself! Let us reconstruct. At four o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife   who, by the way, overheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs. Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills, makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness. At five o'clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation, with a slip of paper      a letter,' Dorcas thinks   in her hand, and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted. Presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o'clock, something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was that something? As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment? One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs. Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband's desk   locked. She was anxious to find some stamps, and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in searching for the stamps she came across something else   that slip of paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband's infidelity. She demanded it from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been lost that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case. Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room. Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp."

Several hectic days lay behind us. In\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\n\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\n\n\"I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, but why?\"\n\n\"Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that   _enfin_, to\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\nwould have   in your so expressive idiom      smelt a rat'! And then,\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!\"\n\n\"I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" besought Poirot, \"I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I grumbled, a little mollified. \"I still think you might have\ngiven me a hint.\"\n\n\"But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\nacquitted?\"\n\n\"Yes, but      \"\n\n\"And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"it was not plain to me!\"\n\n\"Then again,\" continued Poirot, \"at the beginning, did I not repeat to\nyou several times that I didn't want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\nThat should have conveyed something to you.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\"\n\n\"Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the ch  teau, I realized at once\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said impatiently. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp's guilt were\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\"\n\n\"When did you change your mind?\"\n\n\"When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\nwas attracted by the farmer's pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\narrested.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. I don't see why he wished to be arrested?\"\n\n\"Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\nwas clever   his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\nirreproachable alibi   and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\"\n\n\"But I still don't see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\nthe chemist's shop?\"\n\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\n\n\"Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist's shop?\"\n\n\"Miss Howard?\"\n\n\"But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\nThey are a clever pair!\"\n\n\"I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\ndone,\" I remarked.\n\n\"_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp's large sized\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot's? The risk is practically\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\nclever   and that was their undoing.\"\n\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\n\n\"They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\nstrychnine at the village chemist's, and signing the register in his\nhand-writing.\n\n\"On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\nMonday, therefore, at six o'clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\no'clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\nchemist's shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John's handwriting, which she\nhad previously studied carefully.\n\n\"But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\nhim an anonymous note   still copying his hand-writing   which takes him to\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\nhim.\n\n\"So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\nCavendish.\n\n\"But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia's absence   arranged by Inglethorp\nthrough his wife   all these are wasted. And then   he makes his slip.\n\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\nincriminating document.\n\n\"But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger   but is ignorant of where the\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.\"\n\n\"It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\nof the despatch-case?\"\n\n\"Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\nnothing to connect him with the crime.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing I can't make out, why didn't he destroy it at\nonce when he got hold of it?\"\n\n\"Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all   that of keeping\nit on his own person.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it   the five\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys   they\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case   it is locked, and\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\nfor.\n\n\"But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\non him. He may be seen leaving the room   he may be searched. If the\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees   what do you think, _mon\nami?_\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\"\n\nI uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"No one would think of looking there,\" Poirot continued. \"And he will\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\nof evidence against him.\"\n\n\"Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nbedroom, under our very noses?\" I cried.\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my    last link,' and I owe\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't see      \"\n\n\"No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" I murmured, \"so that is the explanation of your\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it was a race for time.\"\n\n\"But I still can't understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\nconfidence on the subject?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\nit in the spill vase.\"\n\n\"But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper's existence. In\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\"\n\n\"I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\nHoward?\"\n\n\"When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Why, what was there to lie about?\"\n\n\"You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\"\n\n\"Yes   more or less.\"\n\n\"You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\n   July 17th' is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\nmean?\"\n\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I don't.\"\n\n\"You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\nthe 7th   the day after Miss Howard's departure? The    1' was written in\nbefore the    7' to turn it into the    17th'.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" I cried indignantly, \"after that, you gave me two reasons\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!\"\n\n\"And very good reasons too,\" replied Poirot. \"For a long time they were\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot   that he\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim's\nmoney.\n\n\"They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\nvery different _d  nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\nstrychnine and glasses in John's room. She puts the beard in the attic.\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\"\n\n\"I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\" I\nremarked. \"It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\nhome to Lawrence.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\nthe pair of schemers.\"\n\n\"His manner was unfortunate,\" I observed thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\nthe crime?\"\n\n\"No,\" I exclaimed, astonished. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\nevidence against her than anyone else.\"\n\n\"You are joking, Poirot!\"\n\n\"No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\nfirst entered his mother's room on the fatal night? It was because,\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room was unbolted.\"\n\n\"But he declared that he saw it bolted!\" I cried.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot dryly. \"And that was just what confirmed my\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\n\n\"But why should he shield her?\"\n\n\"Because he is in love with her.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\"\n\n\"Who told you that, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Cynthia herself.\"\n\n\"_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\"\n\n\"She said that she did not mind at all.\"\n\n\"Then she certainly did mind very much,\" remarked Poirot. \"They are\nlike that   _les femmes!_\"\n\n\"What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\" I said.\n\n\"But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother's room, and\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\nthe theory of    Death from natural causes'.\"\n\n\"And what about the    extra coffee-cup'?\"\n\n\"I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\nAnd he was perfectly right.\"\n\n\"One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\"\n\n\"They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Poirot,\" I said with a sigh, \"I think you have explained\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\nwife are reconciled.\"\n\n\"Thanks to me.\"\n\n\"How do you mean   thanks to you?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\nJohn Cavendish's arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\ndecision?\"\n\n\"Yes, I quite understood your distress.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\nonce. I could have cleared him   though it might have meant a failure to\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\nreal attitude up to the very last moment   which partly accounts for my\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\nbrought to trial?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of    a woman's\nhappiness'. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\"\n\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\n\n\"I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\" said Poirot, smiling at me. \"No\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\ngreatest thing in all the world.\"\n\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. \"Yes, madame,\"\nhe said. \"I have brought him back to you.\" He had stood aside, and as I\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had\ncaught his wife in his arms.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Poirot,\" I said gently. \"Yes, it is the\ngreatest thing in the world.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\n\n\"I   I only      \"\n\n\"Come in,\" I said, springing up.\n\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\n\n\"I   only wanted to tell you something      \"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\nexclaiming: \"You dears!\" kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\nout of the room again.\n\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I asked, surprised.\n\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\n\n\"It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\nher as much as she thought,\" replied Poirot philosophically.\n\n\"But      \"\n\n\"Here he is.\"\n\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\n\n\"Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,\" called Poirot. \"We must congratulate you, is\nit not so?\"\n\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"What is it, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said sadly. \"They are two delightful women!\"\n\n\"And neither of them is for you?\" finished Poirot. \"Never mind. Console\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then      \"\n\n\nTHE END",

You remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp's large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot's? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever   and that was their undoing."

He was already under suspicion, and by making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase."

The paper was safe where it was; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely they would do so afterwards.

It concealed a very opposite emotion. There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he came to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot   that he should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim's money. They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a very different _d  nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the strychnine and glasses in John's room. She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered."
