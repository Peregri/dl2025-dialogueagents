We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact.  You must discard the word Fancy altogether. You have nothing to do with it.  You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.  You don't walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets.  You don't find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls. You must use, for all these purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration.  This is the new discovery.  This is fact.  This is taste. Now, if Mr. M'Choakumchild, will proceed to give his first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his mode of procedure."

It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all but disappears.\nLouisa Bounderby: What do you recommend, father, that I should substitute for the term I used just now?  For the misplaced expression?\nThomas Gradgrind: Louisa, it appears to me that nothing can be plainer.  Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him?  Yes, he does.  The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?  I think nothing can be plainer than that?\nLouisa Bounderby: Shall I marry him?\nThomas Gradgrind: Precisely.

Which we're not a-going to do.\nMr. James Harthouse: Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.\nJosiah Bounderby: Lastly, as to our Hands.  There's not a Hand in this town, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life. That object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. Now, they're not a-going   none of 'em   ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.  And now you know the place.\nJosiah Bounderby: Why, you see, it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I make his acquaintance.  I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr. Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind's letter of introduction.  You are a man of family.  Don't you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.  I am a bit of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.\nJosiah Bounderby: So now, we may shake hands on equal terms.  I say, equal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as proud as you are.  I am just as proud as you are.  Having now asserted my independence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself, and I hope you're pretty well.\nJosiah Bounderby: Perhaps you know, or perhaps you don't know, I married Tom Gradgrind's daughter.  If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me, I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind's daughter.\nMr. James Harthouse: Mr. Bounderby, you anticipate my dearest wishes.\nJosiah Bounderby: This, sir, is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind's eldest daughter.  Loo, Mr. James Harthouse.  Mr. Harthouse has joined your father's muster-roll.  If he is not Tom Gradgrind's colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns.  You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior.  I don't know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn't have married me.  She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\nMr. James Harthouse: Come! If you're in the complimentary line, you'll get on here, for you'll meet with no competition.  I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don't profess to understand the art of paying 'em.  In fact, despise 'em.  But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!  You're a gentleman, and I don't pretend to be one.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that's enough for me.  However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.  She hadn't my advantages   disadvantages you would call 'em, but I call 'em advantages   so you'll not waste your power, I dare say.\nMr. James Harthouse: Mr. Bounderby, is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

I canna be expecten to 't.  'Tis not me as should be looken to for that, sir.  'Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw the rest of us.  What do they tak upon themseln, sir, if not to do't?\nJosiah Bounderby: I'll tell you something towards it, at any rate, We will make an example of half a dozen Slackbridges.  We'll indict the blackguards for felony, and get 'em shipped off to penal settlements.\nJosiah Bounderby: Don't tell me we won't, man, because we will, I tell you!\nStephen Blackpool: Sir, if yo was t' tak a hundred Slackbridges   aw as there is, and aw the number ten times towd   an' was t' sew 'em up in separate sacks, an' sink 'em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry land coom to be, yo'd leave the muddle just wheer 'tis.

I ha no favour for 'em   I ha no reason to favour 'em   but 'tis hopeless and useless to dream o' takin them fro their trade, 'stead o' takin their trade fro them!  Aw that's now about me in this room were heer afore I coom, an' will be heer when I am gone.  Put that clock aboard a ship an' pack it off to Norfolk Island, an' the time will go on just the same.  So 'tis wi' Slackbridge every bit.\nStephen Blackpool: Sir, I canna, wi' my little learning an' my common way, tell the genelman what will better aw this   though some working men o' this town could, above my powers   but I can tell him what I know will never do 't. The strong hand will never do 't.  Vict'ry and triumph will never do 't. Agreeing fur to mak one side unnat'rally awlus and for ever right, and toother side unnat'rally awlus and for ever wrong, will never, never do 't.  Nor yet lettin alone will never do 't.  Let thousands upon thousands alone, aw leading the like lives and aw faw'en into the like muddle, and they will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi' a black unpassable world betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can last.  Not drawin nigh to fok, wi' kindness and patience an' cheery ways, that so draws nigh to one another in their monny troubles, and so cherishes one another in their distresses wi' what they need themseln   like, I humbly believe, as no people the genelman ha seen in aw his travels can beat   will never do 't till th' Sun turns t' ice.

And I also told you, if you remember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.\nStephen Blackpool: I were not up to 't myseln, sir; I do assure yo.\nJosiah Bounderby: Now it's clear to me, that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance.  And you go about, sowing it and raising crops.  That's the business of _your_ life, my friend. You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see, that even your own Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing to do with you.  I never thought those fellows could be right in anything; but I tell you what!  I so far go along with them for a novelty, that _I_'ll have nothing to do with you either. You can finish off what you're at, and then go elsewhere.\nStephen Blackpool: Sir, yo know weel, that if I canna get work wi' yo, I canna get it elsewheer.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

I cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his life, of the affection of his best friend; of the devotion of his best friend; of her unselfishness; of her sacrifice.  The return he makes her, within my observation, is a very poor one.  What she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude, not his ill-humour and caprice.  Careless fellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be regardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a venial offence.\nMr. James Harthouse: In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I must aspire.  My better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction and advice in extricating them   rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale   will give me some influence over him, and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.  I have said enough, and more than enough.  I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees, is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.  As he seems to be loitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards him, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been very silent and doleful of late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched   if there are such things as consciences.  Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.\nYoung Thomas: Halloa!

I could not find that he was worse than I.  There seemed to be a near affinity between us. I only wondered it should be worth his while, who cared for nothing else, to care so much for me."

In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon.

Father, chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance; a man such as I had had no experience of; used to the world; light, polished, easy; making no pretences; avowing the low estimate of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret; conveying to me almost immediately, though I don't know how or by what degrees, that he understood me, and read my thoughts.

I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done.  I am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make.  I do not say that it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something, and it is necessary.  Therefore, though without any other authority than I have given you, and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself, I ask you to depart from this place to-night, under an obligation never to return to it.\nMr. James Harthouse: But do you know, the extent of what you ask?  You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?  You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it's the fact.\nMr. James Harthouse: Besides which, it's so alarmingly absurd.  It would make a man so ridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to back out in such an incomprehensible way.\nCecilia Jupe: I am quite sure, that it is the only reparation in your power, sir.

I know 'em all pretty well.  They're real.  When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever he is, that I know what he means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six. That's what your daughter wants.  Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.

If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don't fall in my way, I shan't, for it won't be worth my while to do it.  As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don't come home to-morrow, by twelve o'clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you'll take charge of her for the future.  What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn't pull together.

Is it asking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in trying to set her right?  You have accepted a great charge of her; for better for worse, for\nJosiah Bounderby: Come! I don't want to be told about that.  I know what I took her for, as well as you do.  Never you mind what I took her for; that's my look out.\nThomas Gradgrind: I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\nJosiah Bounderby: I think differently, I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions.  Now, I don't want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.  To tell you the truth, I don't think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject. As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best.  If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don't fall in my way, I shan't, for it won't be worth my while to do it.  As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don't come home to-morrow, by twelve o'clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you'll take charge of her for the future.  What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn't pull together.  I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to my mark.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

I have kept my observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs against him now, besides his running away, and besides his own confession, which I was just in time to overhear.  I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby.

Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.\nThomas Gradgrind: Bitzer, Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you.
