What riot?\nHenry Tilney: My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusion there is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand? And you, Miss Morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London and instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have done, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George s Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means a simpleton in general.\nEleanor Tilney: And now, Henry, that you have made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in general. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.\nHenry Tilney: I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.\nEleanor Tilney: No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.\nHenry Tilney: What am I to do?\nEleanor Tilney: You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely before her. Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women.\nHenry Tilney: Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom I happen to be in company.\nEleanor Tilney: That is not enough. Be more serious.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look at his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse _cannot_ go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on. What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it? Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it. I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term:  Ah! Thorpe,  said he,  do you happen to want such a little thing as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.   Oh! D ,  said I;  I am your man; what do you ask?  And how much do you think he did, Miss Morland?\nCatherine Morland: I am sure I cannot guess at all.\nJohn Thorpe: Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as new, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage was mine.\nCatherine Morland: And I am sure, I know so little of such things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.\nJohn Thorpe: Neither one nor t other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.\nCatherine Morland: That was very good-natured of you,\nJohn Thorpe: Oh! D   it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful.\nJohn Thorpe: You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day; Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the time.\nJames Morland: Yes, but you forget that your horse was included.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?\nJames Morland: We had better go back, Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late.
