You are writing a life of your grandfather, aren t you? And this kind of thing must take up a lot of time.\nKatharine Hilbery: You ve got it very nearly right, but I only help my mother. I don t write myself.\nRalph Denham: Do you do anything yourself?\nKatharine Hilbery: What do you mean? I don t leave the house at ten and come back at six.\nRalph Denham: I don t mean that.\nKatharine Hilbery: Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays, You see we don t even print as well as they did, and as for poets or painters or novelists there are none; so, at any rate, I m not singular.\nRalph Denham: No, we haven t any great men, I m very glad that we haven t. I hate great men. The worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation.\nMrs. Hilbery: Well, how do you like our things, Mr. Denham?\nMrs. Hilbery: There are some books that _live_, They are young with us, and they grow old with us. Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Denham? But what an absurd question to ask! The truth is, dear Mr. Fortescue has almost tired me out. He is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so profound that, after half an hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out all the lights. But perhaps he d be more wonderful than ever in the dark. What d you think, Katharine? Shall we give a little party in complete darkness? There d have to be bright rooms for the bores....\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

Still, to do her justice, she s no fool, She has taste. She has sense. She can understand you when you talk to her. But she s a woman, and there s an end of it,\nRalph Denham: And did you tell her all this to-night?\nWilliam Rodney: Oh dear me, no. I should never think of telling Katharine the truth about herself. That wouldn t do at all. One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine.\nRalph Denham: Now I ve learnt that she s refused to marry him why don t I go home?\nWilliam Rodney: You re a slave like me, I suppose?\nRalph Denham: A solicitor, yes.\nWilliam Rodney: I sometimes wonder why we don t chuck it. Why don t you emigrate, Denham? I should have thought that would suit you.\nRalph Denham: I ve a family.\nWilliam Rodney: I m often on the point of going myself. And then I know I couldn t live without this\nWilliam Rodney: There are one or two people I m fond of, and there s a little good music, and a few pictures, now and then just enough to keep one dangling about here. Ah, but I couldn t live with savages! Are you fond of books? Music? Pictures? D you care at all for first editions? I ve got a few nice things up here, things I pick up cheap, for I can t afford to give what they ask.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

Look at old John Graham, in his white waistcoat look at Uncle Harley. That s Peter the manservant, I suppose. Uncle John brought him back from India.\nMrs. Hilbery: What is nobler, than to be a woman to whom every one turns, in sorrow or difficulty? How have the young women of your generation improved upon that, Katharine? I can see them now, sweeping over the lawns at Melbury House, in their flounces and furbelows, so calm and stately and imperial (and the monkey and the little black dwarf following behind), as if nothing mattered in the world but to be beautiful and kind. But they did more than we do, I sometimes think. They WERE, and that s better than doing. They seem to me like ships, like majestic ships, holding on their way, not shoving or pushing, not fretted by little things, as we are, but taking their way, like ships with white sails.\nMrs. Hilbery: That s Janie Mannering, I must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress was coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she always dressed like an Empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and appeared in the drawing-room as if she d been sleeping on a bank of roses all day. She could do anything with her hands they all could make a cottage or embroider a petticoat.\nMrs. Hilbery: And that s Queenie Colquhoun, who took her coffin out with her to Jamaica, packed with lovely shawls and bonnets, because you couldn t get coffins in Jamaica, and she had a horror of dying there (as she did), and being devoured by the white ants. And there s Sabine, the loveliest of them all; ah! it was like a star rising when she came into the room. And that s Miriam, in her coachman s cloak, with all the little capes on, and she wore great top-boots underneath. You young people may say you re unconventional, but you re nothing compared with her.\nMrs. Hilbery: Ah, you wretch! what a wicked old despot you were, in your day! How we all bowed down before you!  Maggie,  she used to say,  if it hadn t been for me, where would you be now?  And it was true; she brought them together, you know. She said to my father,  Marry her,  and he did; and she said to poor little Clara,  Fall down and worship him,  and she did; but she got up again, of course. What else could one expect? She was a mere child eighteen and half dead with fright, too. But that old tyrant never repented. She used to say that she had given them three perfect months, and no one had a right to more; and I sometimes think, Katharine, that s true, you know. It s more than most of us have, only we have to pretend, which was a thing neither of them could ever do. I fancy, that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which, with all your outspokenness, you haven t got.\nMrs. Hilbery: They must have been good friends at heart, because she used to sing his songs. Ah, how did it go?\nMrs. Hilbery: It s the vitality of them! That s what we haven t got! We re virtuous, we re earnest, we go to meetings, we pay the poor their wages, but we don t live as they lived.

I ve hit upon a brilliant idea! to lay out, say, a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare, and give them to working men. Some of your clever friends who get up meetings might help us, Katharine. And that might lead to a playhouse, where we could all take parts. You d be Rosalind but you ve a dash of the old nurse in you. Your father s Hamlet, come to years of discretion; and I m well, I m a bit of them all; I m quite a large bit of the fool, but the fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things. Now who shall William be? A hero? Hotspur? Henry the Fifth? No, William s got a touch of Hamlet in him, too. I can fancy that William talks to himself when he s alone. Ah, Katharine, you must say very beautiful things when you re together!\nKatharine Hilbery: Oh, we talk a lot of nonsense,\nMrs. Hilbery: It won t seem to you nonsense in ten years  time,\nMrs. Hilbery: Believe me, Katharine, you ll look back on these days afterwards; you ll remember all the silly things you ve said; and you ll find that your life has been built on them. The best of life is built on what we say when we re in love. It isn t nonsense, Katharine, it s the truth, it s the only truth.\nKatharine Hilbery: Mary Datchet,\nMrs. Hilbery: Ah I half wish I d called you Mary, but it wouldn t have gone with Hilbery, and it wouldn t have gone with Rodney. Now this isn t the passage I wanted. (I never can find what I want.) But it s spring; it s the daffodils; it s the green fields; it s the birds.\nMrs. Hilbery: My dear child, how odious the triumphs of science are!

And Anderson won t keep his horse waiting. (Anderson is a perfect tyrant, but he drove my dear father to the Abbey the day they buried him.) I made bold to come to you, Mr. Denham, not exactly in search of legal assistance (though I don t know who I d rather come to, if I were in trouble), but in order to ask your help in settling some tiresome little domestic affairs that have arisen in my absence. I ve been to Stratford-on-Avon (I must tell you all about that one of these days), and there I got a letter from my sister-in-law, a dear kind goose who likes interfering with other people s children because she s got none of her own. (We re dreadfully afraid that she s going to lose the sight of one of her eyes, and I always feel that our physical ailments are so apt to turn into mental ailments. I think Matthew Arnold says something of the same kind about Lord Byron.) But that s neither here nor there."
