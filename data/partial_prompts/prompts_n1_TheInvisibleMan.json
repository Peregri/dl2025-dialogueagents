You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping. The garrison must help. You must wire for help.

He opened the door of the room, and before I could enter, slammed it in my face.\nThe Invisible Man: I resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible. The house was very old and tumble-down, damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls, and rat infested. Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them. Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished, and others were littered with theatrical lumber, bought second-hand, I judged, from its appearance. In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes. I began routing among these, and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy footstep and, looking up just in time, saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand. I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and suspicious.\nThe Invisible Man: he said slowly.\nThe Invisible Man: He shut the door quietly, and immediately I heard the key turn in the lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I was locked in. For a minute I did not know what to do. I walked from door to window and back, and stood perplexed. A gust of anger came upon me. But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further, and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf. This brought him back, more sinister than ever. That time he actually touched me, jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room.\nThe Invisible Man: Presently he calmed a little.\nThe Invisible Man: he said in an undertone, fingers on lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly out of the room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house, revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys. When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity. By this time I knew he was alone in the house, and so I made no more ado, but knocked him on the head.\"\nKemp: Knocked him on the head?\nThe Invisible Man: Yes stunned him as he was going downstairs. Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of old boots.\nKemp: But I say! The common conventions of humanity\nThe Invisible Man: Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I couldn t think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",
