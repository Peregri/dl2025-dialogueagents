The Italians are a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their mercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the cab-driver down to--to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it. Yet in their heart of hearts they are--how superficial! They have no conception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day:\nMr. Beebe: That belongs to Lavish. A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she'd start a pipe.\nMiss Catherine Alan: Oh, Mr. Beebe, Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.

He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it--and he may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively ATTRACTED by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought. She thought they were commercial travellers-- was the word she used--and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: Just imagine! 'Tut! The early Victorians.' My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: The woman! I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.\nMr. Beebe: Let me finish the story,\nMr. Beebe: Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:\nMr. Beebe: She went. At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.\nLucy: Whatever happened?\nMr. Beebe: No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.\nLucy: Mr. Beebe--old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to know.\nLucy: No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?\nMr. Beebe: I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.\nMiss Catherine Alan: Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get round? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager's lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do NOT like the Emersons. They are not nice.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn't admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He has improved; he doesn't always look as if he's going to burst into tears. He is a clerk in the General Manager's office at one of the big railways--not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.

I have cared for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, I thought; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.\nLucy: And Mr. Vyse? Does he not matter? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no importance, I suppose?\nLucy: May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?\nGeorge Emerson: It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.\nGeorge Emerson: You wouldn't stop us this second time if you understood, I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand. It is being young, It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.\nMiss Bartlett: Oh, Lucia--come back here--oh, what an awful man!\nLucy: Well, he amuses me, Either I'm mad, or else he is, and I'm inclined to think it's the latter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I think, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me again.\nMiss Bartlett: Well, it isn't everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it? Oh, one oughtn't to laugh, really. It might have been very serious. But you were so sensible and brave--so unlike the girls of my day.\nLucy: Let's go down to them.\nFreddy: Hullo, Lucy! There's still light enough for another set, if you two'll hurry.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

The darkness last night was appalling. I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett, and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion. Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin's credit. She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan? I don't know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.

Perhaps she must have a change. I have no sisters or--and I don't understand these things. But why need she go as far as Greece?\nMiss Bartlett: You may well ask that, Why Greece? (What is it, Minnie dear--jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already said too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.\nMiss Bartlett: But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on Lucy's nerves. Our tour was a failure.

It's the part of people that you don't understand.\nLucy: Mr. Beebe, could you help me?\nMr. Beebe: I am more grieved than I can possibly express. It is lamentable, lamentable--incredible.\nMr. Emerson: What's wrong with the boy?\nMr. Beebe: Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me. Marry George, Miss Honeychurch. He will do admirably.\nMr. Emerson: Now it is all dark. Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed. I know. But remember the mountains over Florence and the view. Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave. You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise. George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him. Am I justified?\nMr. Emerson: Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth. Truth counts, Truth does count.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",

        "ground_truth": "George Emerson: Is it this? Is this possible? I'll put a marvel to you. That your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this--of course, very far down. That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped. I can't explain her any other way. Can you? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted her--or she couldn't have described us as she did to her friend. There are details--it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy. We can never make friends with her or thank her. But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad."
