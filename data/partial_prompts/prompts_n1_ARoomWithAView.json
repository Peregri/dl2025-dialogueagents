You think you're so holy and truthful, but really it's only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I hope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?\nFreddy: Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn't say yes. I tried to laugh as if I didn't mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot's in it. Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.\nMrs. Honeychurch: No, I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.\nFreddy: Not a bit! I only let out I didn't like him. I don't hate him, but I don't like him.

He's well connected--I'll say it again if you like: he's well connected.\nMrs. Honeychurch: And he has beautiful manners.\nFreddy: I liked him till just now.
