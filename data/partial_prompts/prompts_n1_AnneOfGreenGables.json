But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night, you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the trustees decided to take you.

That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty thing twice.\nMarilla Cuthbert: You didn't put it back, That brooch isn't anywhere on the bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne.\nAnne Shirley: I did put it back, I don't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back.\nMarilla Cuthbert: I'll go and have another look, If you put that brooch back it's there still.

She must have taken it, that's clear, for there hasn't been a soul in that room since she was in it, by her own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there's nothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she'll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It's a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can't trust. Slyness and untruthfulness--that's what she has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch.

I meant to be so--so--hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go home. Mrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just laughed silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk.

She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.\nMarilla Cuthbert: I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything, Why, three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine, although I haven't made any for three years ever since I found out that the minister didn't approve. I just kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I can't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so.\nAnne Shirley: I must cry, My heart is broken.

Oh, Marilla, I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.\nMarilla Cuthbert: Don't be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she finds you're not to blame. I suppose she thinks you've done it for a silly joke or something of that sort. You'd best go up this evening and tell her how it was.\nAnne Shirley: My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana's injured mother, I wish you'd go, Marilla.

I just told her plainly that currant wine wasn't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I'd sober her up with a right good spanking.\nMrs. Barry: What do you want?\nAnne Shirley: Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to--to--intoxicate Diana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world.

She's sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her to go into the ladies' waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside. she said. She's a case, I should say.\nMatthew Cuthbert: I'm not expecting a girl, It's a boy I've come for. He should be here. Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over from Nova Scotia for me.\nThe Station-Master: Guess there's some mistake, Mrs. Spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge. Said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently. That's all I know about it--and I haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.\nMatthew Cuthbert: I don't understand,\nThe Station-Master: Well, you'd better question the girl, I dare say she'll be able to explain--she's got a tongue of her own, that's certain. Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted.\nAnne Shirley: I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables? I'm very glad to see you. I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night. I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think? You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't to-night.\nMatthew Cuthbert: I'm sorry I was late, Come along. The horse is over in the yard. Give me your bag.\nAnne Shirley: Oh, I can carry it, It isn't heavy. I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy. And if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better keep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old carpet-bag. Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece, haven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I love driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you and belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the asylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was enough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you could imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just in the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because I didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin--I _am_ dreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones.

I counted the cost, Marilla.

I wouldn't have dyed it green.\nAnne Shirley: But I didn't mean to dye it green, Marilla, If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted.

I've been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\nAunt Josephine: I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.
