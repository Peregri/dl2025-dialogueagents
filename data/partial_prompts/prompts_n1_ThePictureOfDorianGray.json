How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have thought you knew more about people s characters.

Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.\nDorian Gray: You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don t affect you. If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.\nAlan Campbell: I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.\nDorian Gray: Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some day. No! don t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view. You don t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from. Don t inquire now. I have told you too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once, Alan.\nAlan Campbell: Don t speak about those days, Dorian they are dead.\nDorian Gray: The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan! If you don t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang me, Alan! Don t you understand?
