My father was the same, that is why he died poor.\nDr. Aziz: So we would sit giving for ever   on a carpet instead of chairs, that is the chief change between now and then, but I think we would never punish anyone.\nDr. Aziz: Poor criminal, give him another chance. It only makes a man worse to go to prison and be corrupted.\nDr. Aziz: We punish no one, no one, and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands, and all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day, when there shall be justice as before   fifty rupees, a hundred, a thousand   till peace comes. Ah, why didn't we live in that time?   But are you admiring Mr. Fielding's house?

Miss Quested anyhow behaved decently this morning, whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all, and it's pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour, it only rests on servants' gossip. Your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects, Aziz.\nDr. Aziz: Is emotion a sack of potatoes, so much the pound, to be measured out? Am I a machine? I shall be told I can use up my emotions by using them, next.\nCyril Fielding: I should have thought you could. It sounds common sense. You can't eat your cake and have it, even in the world of the spirit.\nDr. Aziz: If you are right, there is no point in any friendship; it all comes down to give and take, or give and return, which is disgusting, and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves. Is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic?\nCyril Fielding: Your unfairness is worse than my materialism.\nDr. Aziz: I see. Anything further to complain of?\nDr. Aziz: Because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me, if we are to be friends for ever. You do not like Mrs. Moore, and are annoyed because I do; however, you will like her in time.\nCyril Fielding: I'm sorry to say Mrs. Moore's dead.\nHamidullah: Aziz, he is trying to pull your leg; don't believe him, the villain.\n\nInstruction: Continue the dialogue for 1 lines. \n [/INST]",
