        "raw text": " II\n\nMargaret glanced at her sister s note and pushed it over the\nbreakfast-table to her aunt. There was a moment s hush, and then the\nflood-gates opened.\n\n\"I can tell you nothing, Aunt Juley. I know no more than you do. We\nmet--we only met the father and mother abroad last spring. I know so\nlittle that I didn t even know their son s name. It s all so--\" She\nwaved her hand and laughed a little.\n\n\"In that case it is far too sudden.\"\n\n\"Who knows, Aunt Juley, who knows?\"\n\n\"But, Margaret, dear, I mean, we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve\ncome to facts. It is too sudden, surely.\"\n\n\"Who knows!\"\n\n\"But, Margaret, dear--\"\n\n\"I ll go for her other letters,\" said Margaret. \"No, I won t, I ll\nfinish my breakfast. In fact, I haven t them. We met the Wilcoxes on an\nawful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer. Helen and I\nhad got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at\nSpeyer--the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors--you\nknow-- Speyer, Maintz, and Koln.  Those three sees once commanded the\nRhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street.\"\n\n\"I still feel quite uneasy about this business, Margaret.\"\n\n\"The train crossed by a bridge of boats, and at first sight it looked\nquite fine. But oh, in five minutes we had seen the whole thing. The\ncathedral had been ruined, absolutely ruined, by restoration; not an\ninch left of the original structure. We wasted a whole day, and came\nacross the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public\ngardens. They too, poor things, had been taken in--they were actually\nstopping at Speyer--and they rather liked Helen s insisting that they\nmust fly with us to Heidelberg. As a matter of fact, they did come on\nnext day. We all took some drives together. They knew us well enough to\nask Helen to come and see them--at least, I was asked too, but Tibby s\nillness prevented me, so last Monday she went alone. That s all. You\nknow as much as I do now. It s a young man out of the unknown. She was\nto have come back Saturday, but put off till Monday, perhaps on account\nof--I don t know.\"\n\nShe broke off, and listened to the sounds of a London morning. Their\nhouse was in Wickham Place, and fairly quiet, for a lofty promontory of\nbuildings separated it from the main thoroughfare. One had the sense of\na backwater, or rather of an estuary, whose waters flowed in from the\ninvisible sea, and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without\nwere still beating. Though the promontory consisted of flats--expensive,\nwith cavernous entrance halls, full of concierges and palms--it\nfulfilled its purpose, and gained for the older houses opposite a\ncertain measure of peace.\n\nThese, too, would be swept away in time, and another promontory would\narise upon their site, as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the\nprecious soil of London.\n\nMrs. Munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces. She decided\nthat Margaret was a little hysterical, and was trying to gain time by\na torrent of talk. Feeling very diplomatic, she lamented the fate of\nSpeyer, and declared that never, never should she be so misguided as to\nvisit it, and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration\nwere ill understood in Germany. \"The Germans,\" she said, \"are too\nthorough, and this is all very well sometimes, but at other times it\ndoes not do.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Margaret; \"Germans are too thorough.\" And her eyes began\nto shine.\n\n\"Of course I regard you Schlegels as English,\" said Mrs. Munt\nhastily--\"English to the backbone.\"\n\nMargaret leaned forward and stroked her hand.\n\n\"And that reminds me--Helen s letter.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Aunt Juley, I am thinking all right about Helen s letter. I\nknow--I must go down and see her. I am thinking about her all right. I\nam meaning to go down.\"\n\n\"But go with some plan,\" said Mrs. Munt, admitting into her kindly voice\na note of exasperation. \"Margaret, if I may interfere, don t be taken by\nsurprise. What do you think of the Wilcoxes? Are they our sort? Are they\nlikely people? Could they appreciate Helen, who is to my mind a very\nspecial sort of person? Do they care about Literature and Art? That is\nmost important when you come to think of it. Literature and Art. Most\nimportant. How old would the son be? She says  younger son.  Would he\nbe in a position to marry? Is he likely to make Helen happy? Did you\ngather--\"\n\n\"I gathered nothing.\"\n\nThey began to talk at once.\n\n\"Then in that case--\"\n\n\"In that case I can make no plans, don t you see.\"\n\n\"On the contrary--\"\n\n\"I hate plans. I hate lines of action. Helen isn t a baby.\"\n\n\"Then in that case, my dear, why go down?\"\n\nMargaret was silent. If her aunt could not see why she must go down,\nshe was not going to tell her. She was not going to say, \"I love my dear\nsister; I must be near her at this crisis of her life.\" The affections\nare more reticent than the passions, and their expression more subtle.\nIf she herself should ever fall in love with a man, she, like Helen,\nwould proclaim it from the housetops, but as she loved only a sister she\nused the voiceless language of sympathy.\n\n\"I consider you odd girls,\" continued Mrs. Munt, \"and very wonderful\ngirls, and in many ways far older than your years. But--you won t be\noffended? frankly, I feel you are not up to this business. It requires\nan older person. Dear, I have nothing to call me back to Swanage.\" She\nspread out her plump arms. \"I am all at your disposal. Let me go down to\nthis house whose name I forget instead of you.\"\n\n\"Aunt Juley\"--she jumped up and kissed her--\"I must, must go to Howards\nEnd myself. You don t exactly understand, though I can never thank you\nproperly for offering.\"\n\n\"I do understand,\" retorted Mrs. Munt, with immense confidence. \"I go\ndown in no spirit of interference, but to make inquiries. Inquiries are\nnecessary. Now, I am going to be rude. You would say the wrong thing; to\na certainty you would. In your anxiety for Helen s happiness you would\noffend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous\nquestions--not that one minds offending them.\"\n\n\"I shall ask no questions. I have it in Helen s writing that she and\na man are in love. There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to\nthat. All the rest isn t worth a straw. A long engagement if you like,\nbut inquiries, questions, plans, lines of action--no, Aunt Juley, no.\"\n\nAway she hurried, not beautiful, not supremely brilliant, but filled\nwith something that took the place of both qualities--something best\ndescribed as a profound vivacity, a continual and sincere response to\nall that she encountered in her path through life.\n\n\"If Helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a\npenniless clerk--\"\n\n\"Dear Margaret, do come into the library and shut the door. Your good\nmaids are dusting the banisters.\"\n\n\"--or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter Paterson,\nI should have said the same.\" Then, with one of those turns that\nconvinced her aunt that she was not mad really, and convinced observers\nof another type that she was not a barren theorist, she added: \"Though\nin the case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long\nengagement indeed, I must say.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" said Mrs. Munt; \"and, indeed, I can scarcely\nfollow you. Now, just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the\nWilcoxes. I understand it, but most good people would think you mad.\nImagine how disconcerting for Helen! What is wanted is a person who will\ngo slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and where\nthey are likely to lead to.\"\n\nMargaret was down on this.\n\n\"But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off.\"\n\n\"I think probably it must; but slowly.\"\n\n\"Can you break an engagement off slowly?\" Her eyes lit up. \"What s an\nengagement made of, do you suppose? I think it s made of some hard stuff\nthat may snap, but can t break. It is different to the other ties of\nlife. They stretch or bend. They admit of degree. They re different.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. But won t you let me just run down to Howards House, and\nsave you all the discomfort? I will really not interfere, but I do so\nthoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one\nquiet look round will be enough for me.\"\n\nMargaret again thanked her, again kissed her, and then ran upstairs to\nsee her brother.\n\nHe was not so well.\n\nThe hay fever had worried him a good deal all night. His head ached,\nhis eyes were wet, his mucous membrane, he informed her, in a most\nunsatisfactory condition. The only thing that made life worth living was\nthe thought of Walter Savage Landor, from whose Imaginary Conversations\nshe had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day.\n\nIt was rather difficult. Something must be done about Helen. She must\nbe assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight.\nA telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit\nseemed each moment more impossible. Now the doctor arrived, and said\nthat Tibby was quite bad. Might it really be best to accept Aunt Juley s\nkind offer, and to send her down to Howards End with a note?\n\nCertainly Margaret was impulsive. She did swing rapidly from one\ndecision to another. Running downstairs into the library, she cried:\n\"Yes, I have changed my mind; I do wish that you would go.\"\n\nThere was a train from King s Cross at eleven. At half-past ten Tibby,\nwith rare self-effacement, fell asleep, and Margaret was able to drive\nher aunt to the station.\n\n\"You will remember, Aunt Juley, not to be drawn into discussing the\nengagement. Give my letter to Helen, and say whatever you feel yourself,\nbut do keep clear of the relatives. We have scarcely got their names\nstraight yet, and, besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilised and\nwrong.\"\n\n\"So uncivilised?\" queried Mrs. Munt, fearing that she was losing the\npoint of some brilliant remark.\n\n\"Oh, I used an affected word. I only meant would you please talk the\nthing over only with Helen.\"\n\n\"Only with Helen.\"\n\n\"Because--\" But it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love.\nEven Margaret shrank from it, and contented herself with stroking\nher good aunt s hand, and with meditating, half sensibly and half\npoetically, on the journey that was about to begin from King s Cross.\n\nLike many others who have lived long in a great capital, she had strong\nfeelings about the various railway termini. They are our gates to the\nglorious and the unknown. Through them we pass out into adventure and\nsunshine, to them, alas! we return. In Paddington all Cornwall is latent\nand the remoter west; down the inclines of Liverpool Street lie fenlands\nand the illimitable Broads; Scotland is through the pylons of Euston;\nWessex behind the poised chaos of Waterloo. Italians realise this, as is\nnatural; those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in\nBerlin call the Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d Italia, because by it they\nmust return to their homes. And he is a chilly Londoner who does not\nendow his stations with some personality, and extend to them, however\nshyly, the emotions of fear and love.\n\nTo Margaret--I hope that it will not set the reader against her--the\nstation of King s Cross had always suggested Infinity. Its very\nsituation--withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St.\nPancras--implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great\narches, colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely\nclock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might\nbe prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary\nlanguage of prosperity. If you think this ridiculous, remember that it\nis not Margaret who is telling you about it; and let me hasten to add\nthat they were in plenty of time for the train; that Mrs. Munt, though\nshe took a second-class ticket, was put by the guard into a first (only\ntwo \"seconds\" on the train, one smoking and the other babies--one cannot\nbe expected to travel with babies); and that Margaret, on her return to\nWickham Place, was confronted with the following telegram:\n\n\"All over. Wish I had never written. Tell no one--, HELEN.\"\n\nBut Aunt Juley was gone--gone irrevocably, and no power on earth could\nstop her.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " III\n\nMost complacently did Mrs. Munt rehearse her mission. Her nieces were\nindependent young women, and it was not often that she was able to help\nthem. Emily s daughters had never been quite like other girls. They\nhad been left motherless when Tibby was born, when Helen was five and\nMargaret herself but thirteen. It was before the passing of the Deceased\nWife s Sister Bill, so Mrs. Munt could without impropriety offer to\ngo and keep house at Wickham Place. But her brother-in-law, who was\npeculiar and a German, had referred the question to Margaret, who with\nthe crudity of youth had answered, \"No, they could manage much better\nalone.\" Five years later Mr. Schlegel had died too, and Mrs. Munt had\nrepeated her offer. Margaret, crude no longer, had been grateful and\nextremely nice, but the substance of her answer had been the same. \"I\nmust not interfere a third time,\" thought Mrs. Munt. However, of course\nshe did. She learnt, to her horror, that Margaret, now of age, was\ntaking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into\nForeign Things, which always smash. Silence would have been criminal.\nHer own fortune was invested in Home Rails, and most ardently did\nshe beg her niece to imitate her. \"Then we should be together, dear.\"\n Margaret, out of politeness, invested a few hundreds in the Nottingham\nand Derby Railway, and though the Foreign Things did admirably and the\nNottingham and Derby declined with the steady dignity of which only Home\nRails are capable, Mrs. Munt never ceased to rejoice, and to say, \"I did\nmanage that, at all events. When the smash comes poor Margaret will have\na nest-egg to fall back upon.\" This year Helen came of age, and exactly\nthe same thing happened in Helen s case; she also would shift her money\nout of Consols, but she, too, almost without being pressed, consecrated\na fraction of it to the Nottingham and Derby Railway. So far so good,\nbut in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing. Sooner or\nlater the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves\naway, and if they had delayed hitherto, it was only that they might\nthrow themselves more vehemently in the future. They saw too many people\nat Wickham Place--unshaven musicians, an actress even, German cousins\n(one knows what foreigners are), acquaintances picked up at Continental\nhotels (one knows what they are too). It was interesting, and down\nat Swanage no one appreciated culture more than Mrs. Munt; but it was\ndangerous, and disaster was bound to come. How right she was, and how\nlucky to be on the spot when the disaster came!\n\nThe train sped northward, under innumerable tunnels. It was only an\nhour s journey, but Mrs. Munt had to raise and lower the window again\nand again. She passed through the South Welwyn Tunnel, saw light for\na moment, and entered the North Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame. She\ntraversed the immense viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows and\nthe dreamy flow of Tewin Water. She skirted the parks of politicians. At\ntimes the Great North Road accompanied her, more suggestive of infinity\nthan any railway, awakening, after a nap of a hundred years, to such\nlife as is conferred by the stench of motor-cars, and to such culture\nas is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills. To history,\nto tragedy, to the past, to the future, Mrs. Munt remained equally\nindifferent; hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey, and to\nrescue poor Helen from this dreadful mess.\n\nThe station for Howards End was at Hilton, one of the large villages\nthat are strung so frequently along the North Road, and that owe their\nsize to the traffic of coaching and pre-coaching days. Being near\nLondon, it had not shared in the rural decay, and its long High Street\nhad budded out right and left into residential estates. For about a\nmile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before Mrs. Munt s\ninattentive eyes, a series broken at one point by six Danish tumuli that\nstood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad, tombs of soldiers. Beyond\nthese tumuli, habitations thickened, and the train came to a standstill\nin a tangle that was almost a town.\n\nThe station, like the scenery, like Helen s letters, struck an\nindeterminate note. Into which country will it lead, England or\nSuburbia? It was new, it had island platforms and a subway, and the\nsuperficial comfort exacted by business men. But it held hints of local\nlife, personal intercourse, as even Mrs. Munt was to discover.\n\n\"I want a house,\" she confided to the ticket boy. \"Its name is Howards\nLodge. Do you know where it is?\"\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox!\" the boy called.\n\nA young man in front of them turned around.\n\n\"She s wanting Howards End.\"\n\nThere was nothing for it but to go forward, though Mrs. Munt was too\nmuch agitated even to stare at the stranger. But remembering that there\nwere two brothers, she had the sense to say to him, \"Excuse me asking,\nbut are you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?\"\n\n\"The younger. Can I do anything for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, well\"--she controlled herself with difficulty. \"Really. Are you?\nI--\" She moved; away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice. \"I am\nMiss Schlegel s aunt. I ought to introduce myself, oughtn t I? My name\nis Mrs. Munt.\"\n\nShe was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly, \"Oh,\nrather; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us. Did you want to see her?\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"I ll call you a cab. No; wait a mo--\" He thought. \"Our motor s here.\nI ll run you up in it.\"\n\n\"That is very kind.\"\n\n\"Not at all, if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the\noffice. This way.\"\n\n\"My niece is not with you by any chance?\"\n\n\"No; I came over with my father. He has gone on north in your train.\nYou ll see Miss Schlegel at lunch. You re coming up to lunch, I hope?\"\n\n\"I should like to come UP,\" said Mrs. Munt, not committing herself to\nnourishment until she had studied Helen s lover a little more. He seemed\na gentleman, but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation\nwere numbed. She glanced at him stealthily.\n\nTo a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at\nthe corners of his mouth, or in the rather box-like construction of his\nforehead. He was dark, clean-shaven, and seemed accustomed to command.\n\n\"In front or behind? Which do you prefer? It may be windy in front.\"\n\n\"In front if I may; then we can talk.\"\n\n\"But excuse me one moment--I can t think what they re doing with that\nparcel.\" He strode into the booking-office, and called with a new voice:\n\"Hi! hi, you there! Are you going to keep me waiting all day? Parcel for\nWilcox, Howards End. Just look sharp!\"\n\nEmerging, he said in quieter tones: \"This station s abominably\norganised; if I had my way, the whole lot of  em should get the sack.\nMay I help you in?\"\n\n\"This is very good of you,\" said Mrs. Munt, as she settled herself into\na luxurious cavern of red leather, and suffered her person to be padded\nwith rugs and shawls. She was more civil than she had intended, but\nreally this young man was very kind. Moreover, she was a little afraid\nof him; his self-possession was extraordinary. \"Very good indeed,\" she\nrepeated, adding: \"It is just what I should have wished.\"\n\n\"Very good of you to say so,\" he replied, with a slight look of\nsurprise, which, like most slight looks, escaped Mrs. Munt s attention.\n\"I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train.\"\n\n\"You see, we heard from Helen this morning.\"\n\nYoung Wilcox was pouring in petrol, starting his engine, and performing\nother actions with which this story has no concern. The great car began\nto rock, and the form of Mrs. Munt, trying to explain things, sprang\nagreeably up and down among the red cushions. \"The mater will be very\nglad to see you,\" he mumbled. \"Hi! I say. Parcel. Parcel for Howards\nEnd. Bring it out. Hi!\"\n\nA bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book\nin the other. With the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations\nmingled: \"Sign, must I? Why the -- should I sign after all this bother?\nNot even got a pencil on you? Remember next time I report you to the\nstation-master. My time s of value, though yours mayn t be. Here\"--here\nbeing a tip.\n\n\"Extremely sorry, Mrs. Munt.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"And do you object to going through the village? It is rather a longer\nspin, but I have one or two commissions.\"\n\n\"I should love going through the village. Naturally I am very anxious to\ntalk things over with you.\"\n\nAs she said this she felt ashamed, for she was disobeying Margaret s\ninstructions. Only disobeying them in the letter, surely. Margaret had\nonly warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders. Surely\nit was not \"uncivilised or wrong\" to discuss it with the young man\nhimself, since chance had thrown them together.\n\nA reticent fellow, he made no reply. Mounting by her side, he put on\ngloves and spectacles, and off they drove, the bearded porter--life is a\nmysterious business--looking after them with admiration.\n\nThe wind was in their faces down the station road, blowing the dust into\nMrs. Munt s eyes. But as soon as they turned into the Great North Road\nshe opened fire. \"You can well imagine,\" she said, \"that the news was a\ngreat shock to us.\"\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox,\" she said frankly, \"Margaret has told me\neverything--everything. I have seen Helen s letter.\"\n\nHe could not look her in the face, as his eyes were fixed on his work;\nhe was travelling as quickly as he dared down the High Street. But he\ninclined his head in her direction, and said: \"I beg your pardon; I\ndidn t catch.\"\n\n\"About Helen. Helen, of course. Helen is a very exceptional person--I\nam sure you will let me say this, feeling towards her as you do--indeed,\nall the Schlegels are exceptional. I come in no spirit of interference,\nbut it was a great shock.\"\n\nThey drew up opposite a draper s. Without replying, he turned round in\nhis seat, and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in\ntheir passage through the village. It was settling again, but not all\ninto the road from which he had taken it. Some of it had percolated\nthrough the open windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries\nof the wayside gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the\nlungs of the villagers. \"I wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the\nroads,\" was his comment. Then a man ran out of the draper s with a roll\nof oilcloth, and off they went again.\n\n\"Margaret could not come herself, on account of poor Tibby, so I am here\nto represent her and to have a good talk.\"\n\n\"I m sorry to be so dense,\" said the young man, again drawing up outside\na shop. \"But I still haven t quite understood.\"\n\n\"Helen, Mr. Wilcox--my niece and you.\"\n\nHe pushed up his goggles and gazed at her, absolutely bewildered. Horror\nsmote her to the heart, for even she began to suspect that they were at\ncross-purposes, and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous\nblunder.\n\n\"Miss Schlegel and myself?\" he asked, compressing his lips.\n\n\"I trust there has been no misunderstanding,\" quavered Mrs. Munt. \"Her\nletter certainly read that way.\"\n\n\"What way?\"\n\n\"That you and she--\" She paused, then drooped her eyelids.\n\n\"I think I catch your meaning,\" he said stickily. \"What an extraordinary\nmistake!\"\n\n\"Then you didn t the least--\" she stammered, getting blood-red in the\nface, and wishing she had never been born.\n\n\"Scarcely, as I am already engaged to another lady.\" There was a\nmoment s silence, and then he caught his breath and exploded with, \"Oh,\ngood God! Don t tell me it s some silliness of Paul s.\"\n\n\"But you are Paul.\"\n\n\"I m not.\"\n\n\"Then why did you say so at the station?\"\n\n\"I said nothing of the sort.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, you did.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I did not. My name is Charles.\"\n\n\"Younger\" may mean son as opposed to father, or second brother as\nopposed to first. There is much to be said for either view, and later on\nthey said it. But they had other questions before them now.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that Paul--\"\n\nBut she did not like his voice. He sounded as if he was talking to a\nporter, and, certain that he had deceived her at the station, she too\ngrew angry.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece--\"\n\nMrs. Munt--such is human nature--determined that she would champion the\nlovers. She was not going to be bullied by a severe young man. \"Yes,\nthey care for one another very much indeed,\" she said. \"I dare say they\nwill tell you about it by-and-by. We heard this morning.\"\n\nAnd Charles clenched his fist and cried, \"The idiot, the idiot, the\nlittle fool!\"\n\nMrs. Munt tried to divest herself of her rugs. \"If that is your\nattitude, Mr. Wilcox, I prefer to walk.\"\n\n\"I beg you will do no such thing. I take you up this moment to the\nhouse. Let me tell you the thing s impossible, and must be stopped.\"\n\nMrs. Munt did not often lose her temper, and when she did it was only to\nprotect those whom she loved. On this occasion she blazed out. \"I quite\nagree, sir. The thing is impossible, and I will come up and stop it. My\nniece is a very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit still\nwhile she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her.\"\n\nCharles worked his jaws.\n\n\"Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday, and only\nmet your father and mother at a stray hotel--\"\n\n\"Could you possibly lower your voice? The shopman will overhear.\"\n\nEsprit de classe--if one may coin the phrase--was strong in Mrs. Munt.\nShe sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal\nfunnel, a saucepan, and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth.\n\n\"Right behind?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" And the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust.\n\n\"I warn you: Paul hasn t a penny; it s useless.\"\n\n\"No need to warn us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you. The warning is all the\nother way. My niece has been very foolish, and I shall give her a good\nscolding and take her back to London with me.\"\n\n\"He has to make his way out in Nigeria. He couldn t think of marrying\nfor years, and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the\nclimate, and is in other ways--Why hasn t he told us? Of course he s\nashamed. He knows he s been a fool. And so he has--a downright fool.\"\n\nShe grew furious.\n\n\"Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news.\"\n\n\"If I were a man, Mr. Wilcox, for that last remark I d box your ears.\nYou re not fit to clean my niece s boots, to sit in the same room with\nher, and you dare--you actually dare--I decline to argue with such a\nperson.\"\n\n\"All I know is, she s spread the thing and he hasn t, and my father s\naway and I--\"\n\n\"And all that I know is--\"\n\n\"Might I finish my sentence, please?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nCharles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the\nlane.\n\nShe screamed.\n\nSo they played the game of Capping Families, a round of which is always\nplayed when love would unite two members of our race. But they played it\nwith unusual vigour, stating in so many words that Schlegels were better\nthan Wilcoxes, Wilcoxes better than Schlegels. They flung decency\naside. The man was young, the woman deeply stirred; in both a vein of\ncoarseness was latent. Their quarrel was no more surprising than are\nmost quarrels--inevitable at the time, incredible afterwards. But it was\nmore than usually futile. A few minutes, and they were enlightened. The\nmotor drew up at Howards End, and Helen, looking very pale, ran out to\nmeet her aunt.\n\n\"Aunt Juley, I have just had a telegram from Margaret; I--I meant to\nstop your coming. It isn t--it s over.\"\n\nThe climax was too much for Mrs. Munt. She burst into tears.\n\n\"Aunt Juley dear, don t. Don t let them know I ve been so silly. It\nwasn t anything. Do bear up for my sake.\"\n\n\"Paul,\" cried Charles Wilcox, pulling his gloves off.\n\n\"Don t let them know. They are never to know.\"\n\n\"Oh, my darling Helen--\"\n\n\"Paul! Paul!\"\n\nA very young man came out of the house.\n\n\"Paul, is there any truth in this?\"\n\n\"I didn t--I don t--\"\n\n\"Yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer. Did or didn t Miss\nSchlegel--\"\n\n\"Charles, dear,\" said a voice from the garden. \"Charles, dear Charles,\none doesn t ask plain questions. There aren t such things.\"\n\nThey were all silent. It was Mrs. Wilcox.\n\nShe approached just as Helen s letter had described her, trailing\nnoiselessly over the lawn, and there was actually a wisp of hay in her\nhands. She seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor, but\nto the house, and to the tree that overshadowed it. One knew that she\nworshipped the past, and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone\nbestow had descended upon her--that wisdom to which we give the clumsy\nname of aristocracy. High born she might not be. But assuredly she cared\nabout her ancestors, and let them help her. When she saw Charles angry,\nPaul frightened, and Mrs. Munt in tears, she heard her ancestors say,\n\"Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most. The rest\ncan wait.\" So she did not ask questions. Still less did she pretend that\nnothing had happened, as a competent society hostess would have done.\nShe said: \"Miss Schlegel, would you take your aunt up to your room or\nto my room, whichever you think best. Paul, do find Evie, and tell her\nlunch for six, but I m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for\nit.\" And when they had obeyed her, she turned to her elder son, who\nstill stood in the throbbing, stinking car, and smiled at him with\ntenderness, and without saying a word, turned away from him towards her\nflowers.\n\n\"Mother,\" he called, \"are you aware that Paul has been playing the fool\nagain?\"\n\n\"It is all right, dear. They have broken off the engagement.\"\n\n\"Engagement--!\"\n\n\"They do not love any longer, if you prefer it put that way,\" said Mrs.\nWilcox, stooping down to smell a rose.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IV\n\nHelen and her aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of collapse, and\nfor a little time Margaret had three invalids on her hands. Mrs. Munt\nsoon recovered. She possessed to a remarkable degree the power of\ndistorting the past, and before many days were over she had forgotten\nthe part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe. Even at the\ncrisis she had cried, \"Thank goodness, poor Margaret is saved this!\"\n which during the journey to London evolved into, \"It had to be gone\nthrough by some one,\" which in its turn ripened into the permanent form\nof \"The one time I really did help Emily s girls was over the Wilcox\nbusiness.\" But Helen was a more serious patient. New ideas had burst\nupon her like a thunderclap, and by them and by their reverberations she\nhad been stunned.\n\nThe truth was that she had fallen in love, not with an individual, but\nwith a family.\n\nBefore Paul arrived she had, as it were, been tuned up into his key.\nThe energy of the Wilcoxes had fascinated her, had created new images of\nbeauty in her responsive mind. To be all day with them in the open air,\nto sleep at night under their roof, had seemed the supreme joy of\nlife, and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible\nprelude to love. She had liked giving in to Mr. Wilcox, or Evie,\nor Charles; she had liked being told that her notions of life were\nsheltered or academic; that Equality was nonsense, Votes for Women\nnonsense, Socialism nonsense, Art and Literature, except when conducive\nto strengthening the character, nonsense. One by one the Schlegel\nfetiches had been overthrown, and, though professing to defend them, she\nhad rejoiced. When Mr. Wilcox said that one sound man of business did\nmore good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers, she had\nswallowed the curious assertion without a gasp, and had leant back\nluxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar. When Charles said, \"Why\nbe so polite to servants? they don t understand it,\" she had not given\nthe Schlegel retort of, \"If they don t understand it, I do.\" No; she\nhad vowed to be less polite to servants in the future. \"I am swathed in\ncant,\" she thought, \"and it is good for me to be stripped of it.\" And\nall that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for\nPaul. Paul was inevitable. Charles was taken up with another girl, Mr.\nWilcox was so old, Evie so young, Mrs. Wilcox so different. Round the\nabsent brother she began to throw the halo of Romance, to irradiate\nhim with all the splendour of those happy days, to feel that in him she\nshould draw nearest to the robust ideal. He and she were about the same\nage, Evie said. Most people thought Paul handsomer than his brother. He\nwas certainly a better shot, though not so good at golf. And when Paul\nappeared, flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination,\nand ready to flirt with any pretty girl, Helen met him halfway, or more\nthan halfway, and turned towards him on the Sunday evening.\n\nHe had been talking of his approaching exile in Nigeria, and he should\nhave continued to talk of it, and allowed their guest to recover. But\nthe heave of her bosom flattered him. Passion was possible, and he\nbecame passionate. Deep down in him something whispered, \"This girl\nwould let you kiss her; you might not have such a chance again.\"\n\nThat was \"how it happened,\" or, rather, how Helen described it to her\nsister, using words even more unsympathetic than my own. But the poetry\nof that kiss, the wonder of it, the magic that there was in life for\nhours after it--who can describe that? It is so easy for an Englishman\nto sneer at these chance collisions of human beings. To the insular\ncynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity. It is so\neasy to talk of \"passing emotion,\" and to forget how vivid the emotion\nwas ere it passed. Our impulse to sneer, to forget, is at root a good\none. We recognise that emotion is not enough, and that men and women are\npersonalities capable of sustained relations, not mere opportunities for\nan electrical discharge. Yet we rate the impulse too highly. We do not\nadmit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be\nshaken open. To Helen, at all events, her life was to bring nothing more\nintense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it. He had\ndrawn her out of the house, where there was danger of surprise and\nlight; he had led her by a path he knew, until they stood under the\ncolumn of the vast wych-elm. A man in the darkness, he had whispered \"I\nlove you\" when she was desiring love. In time his slender personality\nfaded, the scene that he had evoked endured. In all the variable years\nthat followed she never saw the like of it again.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Margaret-- \"at least, I understand as much as ever\nis understood of these things. Tell me now what happened on the Monday\nmorning.\"\n\n\"It was over at once.\"\n\n\"How, Helen?\"\n\n\"I was still happy while I dressed, but as I came downstairs I got\nnervous, and when I went into the dining-room I knew it was no good.\nThere was Evie--I can t explain--managing the tea-urn, and Mr. Wilcox\nreading the Times.\"\n\n\"Was Paul there?\"\n\n\"Yes; and Charles was talking to him about stocks and shares, and he\nlooked frightened.\"\n\nBy slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other.\nMargaret saw horror latent in the scene, and Helen s next remark did not\nsurprise her.\n\n\"Somehow, when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful. It is\nall right for us to be frightened, or for men of another sort--father,\nfor instance; but for men like that! When I saw all the others so\nplacid, and Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing, I felt\nfor a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud, just a wall of\nnewspapers and motor-cars and golf-clubs, and that if it fell I should\nfind nothing behind it but panic and emptiness.\"\n\n\"I don t think that. The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people,\nparticularly the wife.\"\n\n\"No, I don t really think that. But Paul was so broad-shouldered; all\nkinds of extraordinary things made it worse, and I knew that it would\nnever do--never. I said to him after breakfast, when the others were\npractising strokes,  We rather lost our heads,  and he looked better\nat once, though frightfully ashamed. He began a speech about having no\nmoney to marry on, but it hurt him to make it, and I stopped him. Then\nhe said,  I must beg your pardon over this, Miss Schlegel; I can t think\nwhat came over me last night.  And I said,  Nor what over me; never\nmind.  And then we parted--at least, until I remembered that I had\nwritten straight off to tell you the night before, and that frightened\nhim again. I asked him to send a telegram for me, for he knew you would\nbe coming or something; and he tried to get hold of the motor, but\nCharles and Mr. Wilcox wanted it to go to the station; and Charles\noffered to send the telegram for me, and then I had to say that the\ntelegram was of no consequence, for Paul said Charles might read it, and\nthough I wrote it out several times, he always said people would suspect\nsomething. He took it himself at last, pretending that he must walk down\nto get cartridges, and, what with one thing and the other, it was not\nhanded in at the post-office until too late. It was the most terrible\nmorning. Paul disliked me more and more, and Evie talked cricket\naverages till I nearly screamed. I cannot think how I stood her all the\nother days. At last Charles and his father started for the station, and\nthen came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that\ntrain, and Paul--oh, rather horrible--said that I had muddled it. But\nMrs. Wilcox knew.\"\n\n\"Knew what?\"\n\n\"Everything; though we neither of us told her a word, and she had known\nall along, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, she must have overheard you.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, but it seemed wonderful. When Charles and Aunt Juley\ndrove up, calling each other names, Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the\ngarden and made everything less terrible. Ugh! but it has been a\ndisgusting business. To think that--\" She sighed.\n\n\"To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment, there must\nbe all these telegrams and anger,\" supplied Margaret.\n\nHelen nodded.\n\n\"I ve often thought about it, Helen. It s one of the most interesting\nthings in the world. The truth is that there is a great outer life that\nyou and I have never touched--a life in which telegrams and anger count.\nPersonal relations, that we think supreme, are not supreme there. There\nlove means marriage settlements, death, death duties. So far I m clear.\nBut here my difficulty. This outer life, though obviously horrid; often\nseems the real one--there s grit in it. It does breed character. Do\npersonal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?\"\n\n\"Oh, Meg--, that s what I felt, only not so clearly, when the Wilcoxes\nwere so competent, and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes.\"\n\n\"Don t you feel it now?\"\n\n\"I remember Paul at breakfast,\" said Helen quietly. \"I shall never\nforget him. He had nothing to fall back upon. I know that personal\nrelations are the real life, for ever and ever.\"\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nSo the Wilcox episode fell into the background, leaving behind it\nmemories of sweetness and horror that mingled, and the sisters pursued\nthe life that Helen had commended. They talked to each other and to\nother people, they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with\nthose whom they liked or could befriend. They even attended public\nmeetings. In their own fashion they cared deeply about politics, though\nnot as politicians would have us care; they desired that public\nlife should mirror whatever is good in the life within. Temperance,\ntolerance, and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them; whereas\nthey did not follow our Forward Policy in Tibet with the keen attention\nthat it merits, and would at times dismiss the whole British Empire with\na puzzled, if reverent, sigh. Not out of them are the shows of history\nerected: the world would be a grey, bloodless place were it composed\nentirely of Miss Schlegels. But the world being what it is, perhaps they\nshine out in it like stars.\n\nA word on their origin. They were not \"English to the back-bone,\" as\ntheir aunt had piously asserted. But, on the other hand, they were not\n\"Germans of the dreadful sort.\" Their father had belonged to a type that\nwas more prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now. He was not the\naggressive German, so dear to the English journalist, nor the domestic\nGerman, so dear to the English wit. If one classed him at all it would\nbe as the countryman of Hegel and Kant, as the idealist, inclined to be\ndreamy, whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air. Not that\nhis life had been inactive. He had fought like blazes against Denmark,\nAustria, France. But he had fought without visualising the results of\nvictory. A hint of the truth broke on him after Sedan, when he saw the\ndyed moustaches of Napoleon going grey; another when he entered Paris,\nand saw the smashed windows of the Tuileries. Peace came--it was all\nvery immense, one had turned into an Empire--but he knew that some\nquality had vanished for which not all Alsace-Lorraine could compensate\nhim. Germany a commercial Power, Germany a naval Power, Germany with\ncolonies here and a Forward Policy there, and legitimate aspirations in\nthe other place, might appeal to others, and be fitly served by\nthem; for his own part, he abstained from the fruits of victory, and\nnaturalised himself in England. The more earnest members of his family\nnever forgave him, and knew that his children, though scarcely English\nof the dreadful sort, would never be German to the back-bone. He had\nobtained work in one of our provincial universities, and there married\nPoor Emily (or Die Englanderin, as the case may be), and as she had\nmoney, they proceeded to London, and came to know a good many people.\nBut his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea. It was his hope that the\nclouds of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time, and\nthe mild intellectual light re-emerge. \"Do you imply that we Germans are\nstupid, Uncle Ernst?\" exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew. Uncle\nErnst replied, \"To my mind. You use the intellect, but you no longer\ncare about it. That I call stupidity.\" As the haughty nephew did not\nfollow, he continued, \"You only care about the things that you can use,\nand therefore arrange them in the following order: Money, supremely\nuseful; intellect, rather useful; imagination, of no use at all.\nNo\"--for the other had protested--\"your Pan-Germanism is no more\nimaginative than is our Imperialism over here. It is the vice of a\nvulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square\nmiles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and\nthat a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That is\nnot imagination. No, it kills it. When their poets over here try to\ncelebrate bigness they are dead at once, and naturally. Your poets\ntoo are dying, your philosophers, your musicians, to whom Europe has\nlistened for two hundred years. Gone. Gone with the little courts that\nnurtured them--gone with Esterhazy and Weimar. What? What s that? Your\nuniversities? Oh yes, you have learned men, who collect more facts\nthan do the learned men of England. They collect facts, and facts, and\nempires of facts. But which of them will rekindle the light within?\"\n\nTo all this Margaret listened, sitting on the haughty nephew s knee.\n\nIt was a unique education for the little girls. The haughty nephew would\nbe at Wickham Place one day, bringing with him an even haughtier wife,\nboth convinced that Germany was appointed by God to govern the world.\nAunt Juley would come the next day, convinced that Great Britain had\nbeen appointed to the same post by the same authority. Were both these\nloud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had met and Margaret\nwith clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her\npresence. Whereat they blushed, and began to talk about the weather.\n\"Papa,\" she cried--she was a most offensive child--\"why will they not\ndiscuss this most clear question?\" Her father, surveying the parties\ngrimly, replied that he did not know. Putting her head on one side,\nMargaret then remarked, \"To me one of two things is very clear; either\nGod does not know his own mind about England and Germany, or else these\ndo not know the mind of God.\" A hateful little girl, but at thirteen\nshe had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without\nperceiving. Her brain darted up and down; it grew pliant and strong. Her\nconclusion was, that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any\norganisation, and from this she never varied.\n\nHelen advanced along the same lines, though with a more irresponsible\ntread. In character she resembled her sister, but she was pretty, and so\napt to have a more amusing time. People gathered round her more readily,\nespecially when they were new acquaintances, and she did enjoy a little\nhomage very much. When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham\nPlace, she often absorbed the whole of the company, while Margaret--both\nwere tremendous talkers--fell flat. Neither sister bothered about this.\nHelen never apologised afterwards, Margaret did not feel the slightest\nrancour. But looks have their influence upon character. The sisters\nwere alike as little girls, but at the time of the Wilcox episode their\nmethods were beginning to diverge; the younger was rather apt to entice\npeople, and, in enticing them, to be herself enticed; the elder went\nstraight ahead, and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game.\n\nLittle need be premised about Tibby. He was now an intelligent man of\nsixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " V\n\nIt will be generally admitted that Beethoven s Fifth Symphony is the\nmost sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man. All\nsorts and conditions are satisfied by it. Whether you are like Mrs.\nMunt, and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come--of course, not so as\nto disturb the others--or like Helen, who can see heroes and shipwrecks\nin the music s flood; or like Margaret, who can only see the music; or\nlike Tibby, who is profoundly versed in counterpoint, and holds the full\nscore open on his knee; or like their cousin, Fraulein Mosebach, who\nremembers all the time that Beethoven is echt Deutsch; or like Fraulein\nMosebach s young man, who can remember nothing but Fraulein Mosebach: in\nany case, the passion of your life becomes more vivid, and you are bound\nto admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings. It is cheap, even\nif you hear it in the Queen s Hall, dreariest music-room in London,\nthough not as dreary as the Free Trade Hall, Manchester; and even if\nyou sit on the extreme left of that hall, so that the brass bumps at you\nbefore the rest of the orchestra arrives, it is still cheap.\n\n\"Whom is Margaret talking to?\" said Mrs. Munt, at the conclusion of the\nfirst movement. She was again in London on a visit to Wickham Place.\n\nHelen looked down the long line of their party, and said that she did\nnot know.\n\n\"Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?\"\n\n\"I expect so,\" Helen replied. Music enwrapped her, and she could not\nenter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an\ninterest in from young men whom one knows.\n\n\"You girls are so wonderful in always having--Oh dear! one mustn t\ntalk.\"\n\nFor the Andante had begun--very beautiful, but bearing a family likeness\nto all the other beautiful Andantes that Beethoven had written, and,\nto Helen s mind, rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the\nfirst movement from the heroes and goblins of the third. She heard the\ntune through once, and then her attention wandered, and she gazed at the\naudience, or the organ, or the architecture. Much did she censure\nthe attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen s\nHall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow\npantaloons, on which the October sunlight struck. \"How awful to marry a\nman like those Cupids!\" thought Helen. Here Beethoven started decorating\nhis tune, so she heard him through once more, and then she smiled at\nher Cousin Frieda. But Frieda, listening to Classical Music, could not\nrespond. Herr Liesecke, too, looked as if wild horses could not make him\ninattentive; there were lines across his forehead, his lips were parted,\nhis pince-nez at right angles to his nose, and he had laid a thick,\nwhite hand on either knee. And next to her was Aunt Juley, so British,\nand wanting to tap. How interesting that row of people was! What diverse\ninfluences had gone to the making! Here Beethoven, after humming and\nhawing with great sweetness, said \"Heigho,\" and the Andante came to an\nend. Applause, and a round of \"wunderschoning\" and pracht volleying from\nthe German contingent. Margaret started talking to her new young man;\nHelen said to her aunt: \"Now comes the wonderful movement: first of all\nthe goblins, and then a trio of elephants dancing\"; and Tibby implored\nthe company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the\ndrum.\n\n\"On the what, dear?\"\n\n\"On the drum, Aunt Juley.\"\n\n\"No; look out for the part where you think you have done with the\ngoblins and they come back,\" breathed Helen, as the music started with\na goblin walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others\nfollowed him. They were not aggressive creatures; it was that that made\nthem so terrible to Helen. They merely observed in passing that there\nwas no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world. After the\ninterlude of elephants dancing, they returned and made the observation\nfor the second time. Helen could not contradict them, for, once at all\nevents, she had felt the same, and had seen the reliable walls of youth\ncollapse. Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! The goblins were\nright. Her brother raised his finger; it was the transitional passage on\nthe drum.\n\nFor, as if things were going too far, Beethoven took hold of the goblins\nand made them do what he wanted. He appeared in person. He gave them\na little push, and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a\nminor, and then--he blew with his mouth and they were scattered! Gusts\nof splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords, colour\nand fragrance broadcast on the field of battle, magnificent victory,\nmagnificent death! Oh, it all burst before the girl, and she even\nstretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible. Any fate was\ntitanic; any contest desirable; conqueror and conquered would alike be\napplauded by the angels of the utmost stars.\n\nAnd the goblins--they had not really been there at all? They were only\nthe phantoms of cowardice and unbelief? One healthy human impulse would\ndispel them? Men like the Wilcoxes, or ex-President Roosevelt, would\nsay yes. Beethoven knew better. The goblins really had been there. They\nmight return--and they did. It was as if the splendour of life might\nboil over and waste to steam and froth. In its dissolution one heard the\nterrible, ominous note, and a goblin, with increased malignity, walked\nquietly over the universe from end to end. Panic and emptiness! Panic\nand emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall.\nBeethoven chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up.\nHe blew with his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were\nscattered. He brought back the gusts of splendour, the heroism, the\nyouth, the magnificence of life and of death, and, amid vast roarings of\na superhuman joy, he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion. But the\ngoblins were there. They could return. He had said so bravely, and that\nis why one can trust Beethoven when he says other things.\n\nHelen pushed her way out during the applause. She desired to be alone.\nThe music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in\nher career.\n\nShe read it as a tangible statement, which could never be superseded.\nThe notes meant this and that to her, and they could have no other\nmeaning, and life could have no other meaning. She pushed right out of\nthe building and walked slowly down the outside staircase, breathing the\nautumnal air, and then she strolled home.\n\n\"Margaret,\" called Mrs. Munt, \"is Helen all right?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"She is always going away in the middle of a programme,\" said Tibby.\n\n\"The music has evidently moved her deeply,\" said Fraulein Mosebach.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Margaret s young man, who had for some time been\npreparing a sentence, \"but that lady has, quite inadvertently, taken my\numbrella.\"\n\n\"Oh, good gracious me!--I am so sorry. Tibby, run after Helen.\"\n\n\"I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do.\"\n\n\"Tibby, love, you must go.\"\n\n\"It isn t of any consequence,\" said the young man, in truth a little\nuneasy about his umbrella.\n\n\"But of course it is. Tibby! Tibby!\"\n\nTibby rose to his feet, and wilfully caught his person on the backs of\nthe chairs. By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his\nhat, and had deposited his full score in safety, it was \"too late\" to\ngo after Helen. The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move\nduring their performance.\n\n\"My sister is so careless,\" whispered Margaret.\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the young man; but his voice was dead and cold.\n\n\"If you would give me your address--\"\n\n\"Oh, not at all, not at all;\" and he wrapped his greatcoat over his\nknees.\n\nThen the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in Margaret s ears. Brahms, for\nall his grumbling and grizzling, had never guessed what it felt like\nto be suspected of stealing an umbrella. For this fool of a young man\nthought that she and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence\ntrick on him, and that if he gave his address they would break into\nhis rooms some midnight or other and steal his walking-stick too. Most\nladies would have laughed, but Margaret really minded, for it gave her\na glimpse into squalor. To trust people is a luxury in which only the\nwealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it. As soon as Brahms had\ngrunted himself out, she gave him her card and said, \"That is where\nwe live; if you preferred, you could call for the umbrella after the\nconcert, but I didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our\nfault.\"\n\nHis face brightened a little when he saw that Wickham Place was W. It\nwas sad to see him corroded with suspicion, and yet not daring to be\nimpolite, in case these well-dressed people were honest after all. She\ntook it as a good sign that he said to her, \"It s a fine programme\nthis afternoon, is it not?\" for this was the remark with which he had\noriginally opened, before the umbrella intervened.\n\n\"The Beethoven s fine,\" said Margaret, who was not a female of the\nencouraging type. \"I don t like the Brahms, though, nor the Mendelssohn\nthat came first and ugh! I don t like this Elgar that s coming.\"\n\n\"What, what?\" called Herr Liesecke, overhearing. \"The  Pomp and\nCircumstance  will not be fine?\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret, you tiresome girl!\" cried her aunt.\n\n\"Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for  Pomp and\nCircumstance,  and you are undoing all my work. I am so anxious for him\nto hear what WE are doing in music. Oh,--you musn t run down our English\ncomposers, Margaret.\"\n\n\"For my part, I have heard the composition at Stettin,\" said Fraulein\nMosebach, \"on two occasions. It is dramatic, a little.\"\n\n\"Frieda, you despise English music. You know you do. And English art.\nAnd English literature, except Shakespeare, and he s a German. Very\nwell, Frieda, you may go.\"\n\nThe lovers laughed and glanced at each other. Moved by a common impulse,\nthey rose to their feet and fled from \"Pomp and Circumstance.\"\n\n\"We have this call to pay in Finsbury Circus, it is true,\" said Herr\nLiesecke, as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music\nstarted.\n\n\"Margaret--\" loudly whispered by Aunt Juley.\n\n\"Margaret, Margaret! Fraulein Mosebach has left her beautiful little bag\nbehind her on the seat.\"\n\nSure enough, there was Frieda s reticule, containing her address book,\nher pocket dictionary, her map of London, and her money.\n\n\"Oh, what a bother--what a family we are! Fr--frieda!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said all those who thought the music fine.\n\n\"But it s the number they want in Finsbury Circus.\"\n\n\"Might I--couldn t I--\" said the suspicious young man, and got very red.\n\n\"Oh, I would be so grateful.\"\n\nHe took the bag--money clinking inside it--and slipped up the gangway\nwith it. He was just in time to catch them at the swing-door, and he\nreceived a pretty smile from the German girl and a fine bow from her\ncavalier. He returned to his seat upsides with the world. The trust that\nthey had reposed in him was trivial, but he felt that it cancelled his\nmistrust for them, and that probably he would not be \"had\" over his\numbrella. This young man had been \"had\" in the past badly, perhaps\noverwhelmingly--and now most of his energies went in defending himself\nagainst the unknown. But this afternoon--perhaps on account of music--he\nperceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good\nof being alive? Wickham Place, W., though a risk, was as safe as most\nthings, and he would risk it.\n\nSo when the concert was over and Margaret said, \"We live quite near; I\nam going there now. Could you walk round with me, and we ll find your\numbrella?\" he said, \"Thank you,\" peaceably, and followed her out of\nthe Queen s Hall. She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady\ndownstairs, or to carry a lady s programme for her--his class was near\nenough her own for its manners to vex her. But she found him interesting\non the whole--every one interested the Schlegels on the whole at that\ntime--and while her lips talked culture, her heart was planning to\ninvite him to tea.\n\n\"How tired one gets after music!\" she began.\n\n\"Do you find the atmosphere of Queen s Hall oppressive?\"\n\n\"Yes, horribly.\"\n\n\"But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive.\"\n\n\"Do you go there much?\"\n\n\"When my work permits, I attend the gallery for the Royal Opera.\"\n\nHelen would have exclaimed, \"So do I. I love the gallery,\" and thus\nhave endeared herself to the young man. Helen could do these things. But\nMargaret had an almost morbid horror of \"drawing people out,\" of \"making\nthings go.\" She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden, but she did\nnot \"attend\" it, preferring the more expensive seats; still less did she\nlove it. So she made no reply.\n\n\"This year I have been three times--to  Faust,   Tosca,  and--\" Was it\n\"Tannhouser\" or \"Tannhoyser\"? Better not risk the word.\n\nMargaret disliked \"Tosca\" and \"Faust.\" And so, for one reason and\nanother, they walked on in silence, chaperoned by the voice of Mrs.\nMunt, who was getting into difficulties with her nephew.\n\n\"I do in a WAY remember the passage, Tibby, but when every instrument is\nso beautiful, it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another.\nI am sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts. Not a\ndull note from beginning to end. I only wish that our German friends had\nstayed till it finished.\"\n\n\"But surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low\nC, Aunt Juley?\" came Tibby s voice. \"No one could. It s unmistakable.\"\n\n\"A specially loud part?\" hazarded Mrs. Munt. \"Of course I do not go\nin for being musical,\" she added, the shot failing. \"I only care for\nmusic--a very different thing. But still I will say this for myself--I\ndo know when I like a thing and when I don t. Some people are the same\nabout pictures. They can go into a picture gallery--Miss Conder can--and\nsay straight off what they feel, all round the wall. I never could do\nthat. But music is so different from pictures, to my mind. When it comes\nto music I am as safe as houses, and I assure you, Tibby, I am by no\nmeans pleased by everything. There was a thing--something about a faun\nin French--which Helen went into ecstasies over, but I thought it most\ntinkling and superficial, and said so, and I held to my opinion too.\"\n\n\"Do you agree?\" asked Margaret. \"Do you think music is so different from\npictures?\"\n\n\"I--I should have thought so, kind of,\" he said.\n\n\"So should I. Now, my sister declares they re just the same. We have\ngreat arguments over it. She says I m dense; I say she s sloppy.\"\n Getting under way, she cried: \"Now, doesn t it seem absurd to you? What\nis the good of the Arts if they re interchangeable? What is the good\nof the ear if it tells you the same as the eye? Helen s one aim is to\ntranslate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures into the\nlanguage of music. It s very ingenious, and she says several pretty\nthings in the process, but what s gained, I d like to know? Oh, it s\nall rubbish, radically false. If Monet s really Debussy, and Debussy s\nreally Monet, neither gentleman is worth his salt--that s my opinion.\"\n\nEvidently these sisters quarrelled.\n\n\"Now, this very symphony that we ve just been having--she won t let it\nalone. She labels it with meanings from start to finish; turns it into\nliterature. I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be\ntreated as music. Yet I don t know. There s my brother--behind us. He\ntreats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than any\none, simply furious. With him I daren t even argue.\"\n\nAn unhappy family, if talented.\n\n\"But, of course, the real villain is Wagner. He has done more than any\nman in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts. I\ndo feel that music is in a very serious state just now, though\nextraordinarily interesting. Every now and then in history there do\ncome these terrible geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of\nthought at once. For a moment it s splendid. Such a splash as never\nwas. But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and the wells--as it were, they\ncommunicate with each other too easily now, and not one of them will run\nquite clear. That s what Wagner s done.\"\n\nHer speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds. If only he\ncould talk like this, he would have caught the world. Oh, to acquire\nculture! Oh, to pronounce foreign names correctly! Oh, to be well\ninformed, discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started! But\nit would take one years. With an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours\nin the evening, how was it possible to catch up with leisured women,\nwho had been reading steadily from childhood? His brain might be full\nof names, he might have even heard of Monet and Debussy; the trouble\nwas that he could not string them together into a sentence, he could not\nmake them \"tell,\" he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella.\nYes, the umbrella was the real trouble. Behind Monet and Debussy the\numbrella persisted, with the steady beat of a drum. \"I suppose my\numbrella will be all right,\" he was thinking. \"I don t really mind about\nit. I will think about music instead. I suppose my umbrella will be all\nright.\" Earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats. Ought he\nto have paid as much as two shillings? Earlier still he had wondered,\n\"Shall I try to do without a programme?\" There had always been something\nto worry him ever since he could remember, always something that\ndistracted him in the pursuit of beauty. For he did pursue beauty, and,\ntherefore, Margaret s speeches did flutter away from him like birds.\n\nMargaret talked ahead, occasionally saying, \"Don t you think so? don t\nyou feel the same?\" And once she stopped, and said, \"Oh, do interrupt\nme!\" which terrified him. She did not attract him, though she filled him\nwith awe. Her figure was meagre, her face seemed all teeth and eyes, her\nreferences to her sister and her brother were uncharitable. For all\nher cleverness and culture, she was probably one of those soulless,\natheistical women who have been so shown up by Miss Corelli. It was\nsurprising (and alarming) that she should suddenly say, \"I do hope that\nyou ll come in and have some tea. We should be so glad. I have dragged\nyou so far out of your way.\"\n\nThey had arrived at Wickham Place. The sun had set, and the backwater,\nin deep shadow, was filling with a gentle haze. To the right the\nfantastic sky-line of the flats towered black against the hues of\nevening; to the left the older houses raised a square-cut, irregular\nparapet against the grey. Margaret fumbled for her latch-key. Of course\nshe had forgotten it. So, grasping her umbrella by its ferrule, she\nleant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window.\n\n\"Helen! Let us in!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said a voice.\n\n\"You ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella.\"\n\n\"Taken a what?\" said Helen, opening the door. \"Oh, what s that? Do come\nin! How do you do?\"\n\n\"Helen, you must not be so ramshackly. You took this gentleman s\numbrella away from Queen s Hall, and he has had the trouble of coming\nround for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry!\" cried Helen, all her hair flying. She had pulled\noff her hat as soon as she returned, and had flung herself into the\nbig dining-room chair. \"I do nothing but steal umbrellas. I am so very\nsorry! Do come in and choose one. Is yours a hooky or a nobbly? Mine s a\nnobbly--at least, I THINK it is.\"\n\nThe light was turned on, and they began to search the hall, Helen, who\nhad abruptly parted with the Fifth Symphony, commenting with shrill\nlittle cries.\n\n\"Don t you talk, Meg! You stole an old gentleman s silk top-hat. Yes,\nshe did, Aunt Juley. It is a positive fact. She thought it was a muff.\nOh, heavens! I ve knocked the In-and-Out card down. Where s Frieda?\nTibby, why don t you ever--No, I can t remember what I was going to say.\nThat wasn t it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up. What about this\numbrella?\" She opened it. \"No, it s all gone along the seams. It s an\nappalling umbrella. It must be mine.\"\n\nBut it was not.\n\nHe took it from her, murmured a few words of thanks, and then fled, with\nthe lilting step of the clerk.\n\n\"But if you will stop--\" cried Margaret. \"Now, Helen, how stupid you ve\nbeen!\"\n\n\"Whatever have I done?\"\n\n\"Don t you see that you ve frightened him away? I meant him to stop to\ntea. You oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella. I saw\nhis nice eyes getting so miserable. No, it s not a bit of good now.\" For\nHelen had darted out into the street, shouting, \"Oh, do stop!\"\n\n\"I dare say it is all for the best,\" opined Mrs. Munt. \"We know nothing\nabout the young man, Margaret, and your drawing-room is full of very\ntempting little things.\"\n\nBut Helen cried: \"Aunt Juley, how can you! You make me more and more\nashamed. I d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons\nthan that I--Well, I must shut the front-door, I suppose. One more\nfailure for Helen.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent,\" said\nMargaret. Seeing that her aunt did not understand, she added: \"You\nremember  rent ? It was one of father s words--Rent to the ideal, to his\nown faith in human nature. You remember how he would trust strangers,\nand if they fooled him he would say,  It s better to be fooled than to\nbe suspicious --that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the\nwant-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil.\"\n\n\"I remember something of the sort now,\" said Mrs. Munt, rather tartly,\nfor she longed to add, \"It was lucky that your father married a wife\nwith money.\" But this was unkind, and she contented herself with, \"Why,\nhe might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well.\"\n\n\"Better that he had,\" said Helen stoutly.\n\n\"No, I agree with Aunt Juley,\" said Margaret. \"I d rather mistrust\npeople than lose my little Ricketts. There are limits.\"\n\nTheir brother, finding the incident commonplace, had stolen upstairs to\nsee whether there were scones for tea. He warmed the teapot--almost too\ndeftly--rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided,\npoured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with really\nboiling water, and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would\nlose the aroma.\n\n\"All right, Auntie Tibby,\" called Helen, while Margaret, thoughtful\nagain, said: \"In a way, I wish we had a real boy in the house--the kind\nof boy who cares for men. It would make entertaining so much easier.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said her sister. \"Tibby only cares for cultured females\nsinging Brahms.\" And when they joined him she said rather sharply: \"Why\ndidn t you make that young man welcome, Tibby? You must do the host a\nlittle, you know. You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into\nstopping, instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women.\"\n\nTibby sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead.\n\n\"Oh, it s no good looking superior. I mean what I say.\"\n\n\"Leave Tibby alone!\" said Margaret, who could not bear her brother to be\nscolded.\n\n\"Here s the house a regular hen-coop!\" grumbled Helen.\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" protested Mrs. Munt. \"How can you say such dreadful\nthings! The number of men you get here has always astonished me. If\nthere is any danger it s the other way round.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it s the wrong sort of men, Helen means.\"\n\n\"No, I don t,\" corrected Helen. \"We get the right sort of man, but the\nwrong side of him, and I say that s Tibby s fault. There ought to be a\nsomething about the house--an--I don t know what.\"\n\n\"A touch of the W s, perhaps?\"\n\nHelen put out her tongue.\n\n\"Who are the W s?\" asked Tibby.\n\n\"The W s are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you don t,\nso there!\"\n\n\"I suppose that ours is a female house,\" said Margaret, \"and one must\njust accept it. No, Aunt Juley, I don t mean that this house is full of\nwomen. I am trying to say something much more clever. I mean that it\nwas irrevocably feminine, even in father s time. Now I m sure you\nunderstand! Well, I ll give you another example. It ll shock you, but\nI don t care. Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner-party, and that\nthe guests had been Leighton, Millais, Swinburne, Rossetti, Meredith,\nFitzgerald, etc. Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would\nhave been artistic? Heavens, no! The very chairs on which they sat would\nhave seen to that. So with our house--it must be feminine, and all we\ncan do is to see that it isn t effeminate. Just as another house that\nI can mention, but won t, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its\ninmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal.\"\n\n\"That house being the W s house, I presume,\" said Tibby.\n\n\"You re not going to be told about the W s, my child,\" Helen cried, \"so\ndon t you think it. And on the other hand, I don t the least mind if\nyou find out, so don t you think you ve done anything clever, in either\ncase. Give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"You do what you can for the house,\" said Margaret. \"The drawing-room\nreeks of smoke.\"\n\n\"If you smoked too, the house might suddenly turn masculine. Atmosphere\nis probably a question of touch and go. Even at Queen Victoria s\ndinner-party--if something had been just a little Different--perhaps if\nshe d worn a clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin.\"\n\n\"With an India shawl over her shoulders--\"\n\n\"Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm-pin.\"\n\nBursts of disloyal laughter--you must remember that they are half\nGerman--greeted these suggestions, and Margaret said pensively, \"How\ninconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art.\" And the\nconversation drifted away and away, and Helen s cigarette turned to\na spot in the darkness, and the great flats opposite were sown with\nlighted windows which vanished and were relit again, and vanished\nincessantly. Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently--a tide that\ncould never be quiet, while in the east, invisible behind the smokes of\nWapping, the moon was rising.\n\n\"That reminds me, Margaret. We might have taken that young man into\nthe dining-room, at all events. Only the majolica plate--and that is so\nfirmly set in the wall. I am really distressed that he had no tea.\"\n\nFor that little incident had impressed the three women more than might\nbe supposed. It remained as a goblin footfall, as a hint that all is not\nfor the best in the best of all possible worlds, and that beneath these\nsuperstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed boy, who has\nrecovered his umbrella indeed, but who has left no address behind him,\nand no name.\n\n\n\n",

When it comes to music I am as safe as houses, and I assure you, Tibby, I am by no means pleased by everything.

What is the good of the Arts if they re interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye? Helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures into the language of music. It s very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but what s gained, I d like to know? Oh, it s all rubbish, radically false. If Monet s really Debussy, and Debussy s really Monet, neither gentleman is worth his salt--that s my opinion. Now, this very symphony that we ve just been having--she won t let it alone. She labels it with meanings from start to finish; turns it into literature. I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music. Yet I don t know. There s my brother--behind us. He treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than any one, simply furious. With him I daren t even argue. But, of course, the real villain is Wagner. He has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts. I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now, though extraordinarily interesting. Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of thought at once. For a moment it s splendid. Such a splash as never was. But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and the wells--as it were, they communicate with each other too easily now, and not one of them will run quite clear. That s what Wagner s done."

This story deals\nwith gentlefolk, or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are\ngentlefolk.\n\nThe boy, Leonard Bast, stood at the extreme verge of gentility. He was\nnot in the abyss, but he could see it, and at times people whom he knew\nhad dropped in, and counted no more. He knew that he was poor, and would\nadmit it; he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to\nthe rich. This may be splendid of him. But he was inferior to most rich\npeople, there is not the least doubt of it. He was not as courteous\nas the average rich man, nor as intelligent, nor as healthy, nor as\nlovable. His mind and his body had been alike underfed, because he was\npoor, and because he was modern they were always craving better food.\nHad he lived some centuries ago, in the brightly coloured civilisations\nof the past, he would have had a definite status, his rank and his\nincome would have corresponded. But in his day the angel of Democracy\nhad arisen, enshadowing the classes with leathern wings, and\nproclaiming, \"All men are equal--all men, that is to say, who possess\numbrellas,\" and so he was obliged to assert gentility, lest he slip\ninto the abyss where nothing counts, and the statements of Democracy are\ninaudible.\n\nAs he walked away from Wickham Place, his first care was to prove that\nhe was as good as the Miss Schlegels. Obscurely wounded in his pride, he\ntried to wound them in return. They were probably not ladies. Would real\nladies have asked him to tea? They were certainly ill-natured and cold.\nAt each step his feeling of superiority increased. Would a real lady\nhave talked about stealing an umbrella? Perhaps they were thieves\nafter all, and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a\nchloroformed handkerchief over his face. He walked on complacently as\nfar as the Houses of Parliament. There an empty stomach asserted itself,\nand told him that he was a fool.\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Bast.\"\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Dealtry.\"\n\n\"Nice evening.\"\n\n\"Evening.\"\n\nMr. Dealtry, a fellow clerk, passed on, and Leonard stood wondering\nwhether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him, or\nwhether he would walk. He decided to walk--it is no good giving in,\nand he had spent money enough at Queen s Hall--and he walked over\nWestminster Bridge, in front of St. Thomas s Hospital, and through\nthe immense tunnel that passes under the South-Western main line at\nVauxhall. In the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the\ntrains. A sharp pain darted through his head, and he was conscious of\nthe exact form of his eye sockets. He pushed on for another mile, and\ndid not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called\nCamelia Road which was at present his home.\n\nHere he stopped again, and glanced suspiciously to right and left,\nlike a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole. A block of flats,\nconstructed with extreme cheapness, towered on either hand. Farther down\nthe road two more blocks were being built, and beyond these an old house\nwas being demolished to accommodate another pair. It was the kind\nof scene that may be observed all over London, whatever the\nlocality--bricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of\nthe water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her\nsoil. Camelia Road would soon stand out like a fortress, and command,\nfor a little, an extensive view. Only for a little. Plans were out for\nthe erection of flats in Magnolia Road also. And again a few years, and\nall the flats in either road might be pulled down, and new buildings, of\na vastness at present unimaginable, might arise where they had fallen.\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Bast.\"\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Cunningham.\"\n\n\"Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester,\"\n repeated Mr. Cunningham, tapping the Sunday paper, in which the calamity\nin question had just been announced to him.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Leonard, who was not going to let on that he had not\nbought a Sunday paper.\n\n\"If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be\nstationary in 1960.\"\n\n\"You don t say so.\"\n\n\"I call it a very serious thing, eh?\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Cunningham.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Bast.\"\n\nThen Leonard entered Block B of the flats, and turned, not upstairs,\nbut down, into what is known to house agents as a semi-basement, and to\nother men as a cellar. He opened the door, and cried, \"Hullo!\" with\nthe pseudo geniality of the Cockney. There was no reply. \"Hullo!\" he\nrepeated. The sitting-room was empty, though the electric light had been\nleft burning. A look of relief came over his face, and he flung himself\ninto the armchair.\n\nThe sitting-room contained, besides the armchair, two other chairs, a\npiano, a three-legged table, and a cosy corner. Of the walls, one was\noccupied by the window, the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling\nwith Cupids. Opposite the window was the door, and beside the door a\nbookcase, while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of\nMaud Goodman. It was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the\ncurtains were drawn, and the lights turned on, and the gas-stove unlit.\nBut it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the\ndwelling-place. It had been too easily gained, and could be relinquished\ntoo easily.\n\nAs Leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the three-legged table,\nand a photograph frame, honourably poised upon it, slid sideways, fell\noff into the fireplace, and smashed. He swore in a colourless sort of\nway, and picked the photograph up. It represented a young lady called\nJacky, and had been taken at the time when young ladies called Jacky\nwere often photographed with their mouths open. Teeth of dazzling\nwhiteness extended along either of Jacky s jaws, and positively weighed\nher head sideways, so large were they and so numerous. Take my word for\nit, that smile was simply stunning, and it is only you and I who will be\nfastidious, and complain that true joy begins in the eyes, and that\nthe eyes of Jacky did not accord with her smile, but were anxious and\nhungry.\n\nLeonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass, and cut his fingers\nand swore again. A drop of blood fell on the frame, another followed,\nspilling over on to the exposed photograph. He swore more vigorously,\nand dashed into the kitchen, where he bathed his hands. The kitchen\nwas the same size as the sitting-room; beyond it was a bedroom. This\ncompleted his home. He was renting the flat furnished; of all the\nobjects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph\nframe, the Cupids, and the books.\n\n\"Damn, damn, damnation!\" he murmured, together with such other words as\nhe had learnt from older men. Then he raised his hand to his forehead\nand said, \"Oh, damn it all--\" which meant something different. He pulled\nhimself together. He drank a little tea, black and silent, that still\nsurvived upon an upper shelf. He swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake.\nThen he went back to the sitting-room, settled himself anew, and began\nto read a volume of Ruskin.\n\n\"Seven miles to the north of Venice--\"\n\nHow perfectly the famous chapter opens! How supreme its command of\nadmonition and of poetry! The rich man is speaking to us from his\ngondola.\n\n\"Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the\ncity rise little above low-water mark attain by degrees a higher level,\nand knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass, raised here and\nthere into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea.\"\n\nLeonard was trying to form his style on Ruskin; he understood him to\nbe the greatest master of English Prose. He read forward steadily,\noccasionally making a few notes.\n\n\"Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and\nfirst (for of the shafts enough has been said already), what is very\npeculiar to this church--its luminousness.\"\n\nWas there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence? Could he\nadapt it to the needs of daily life? Could he introduce it, with\nmodifications, when he next wrote a letter to his brother, the\nlay-reader? For example:\n\n\"Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and\nfirst (for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already),\nwhat is very peculiar to this flat--its obscurity.\"\n\nSomething told him that the modifications would not do; and that\nsomething, had he known it, was the spirit of English Prose. \"My flat is\ndark as well as stuffy.\" Those were the words for him.\n\nAnd the voice in the gondola rolled on, piping melodiously of Effort\nand Self-Sacrifice, full of high purpose, full of beauty, full even of\nsympathy and the love of men, yet somehow eluding all that was actual\nand insistent in Leonard s life. For it was the voice of one who had\nnever been dirty or hungry, and had not guessed successfully what dirt\nand hunger are.\n\nLeonard listened to it with reverence. He felt that he was being done\ngood to, and that if he kept on with Ruskin, and the Queen s Hall\nConcerts, and some pictures by Watts, he would one day push his head\nout of the grey waters and see the universe. He believed in sudden\nconversion, a belief which may be right, but which is peculiarly\nattractive to a half-baked mind. It is the basis of much popular\nreligion; in the domain of business it dominates the Stock Exchange,\nand becomes that \"bit of luck\" by which all successes and failures are\nexplained. \"If only I had a bit of luck, the whole thing would come\nstraight... He s got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20\nh.p. Fiat, but then, mind you, he s had luck... I m sorry the wife s\nso late, but she never has any luck over catching trains.\" Leonard\nwas superior to these people; he did believe in effort and in a steady\npreparation for the change that he desired. But of a heritage that may\nexpand gradually, he had no conception; he hoped to come to Culture\nsuddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus. Those Miss\nSchlegels had come to it; they had done the trick; their hands were upon\nthe ropes, once and for all. And meanwhile, his flat was dark, as well\nas stuffy.\n\nPresently there was a noise on the staircase. He shut up Margaret s card\nin the pages of Ruskin, and opened the door. A woman entered, of whom\nit is simplest to say that she was not respectable. Her appearance was\nawesome. She seemed all strings and bell-pulls--ribbons, chains, bead\nnecklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round\nher neck, with the ends uneven. Her throat was bare, wound with a double\nrow of pearls, her arms were bare to the elbows, and might again\nbe detected at the shoulder, through cheap lace. Her hat, which was\nflowery, resembled those punnets, covered with flannel, which we sowed\nwith mustard and cress in our childhood, and which germinated here yes,\nand there no. She wore it on the back of her head. As for her hair, or\nrather hairs, they are too complicated to describe, but one system went\ndown her back, lying in a thick pad there, while another, created for\na lighter destiny, rippled around her forehead. The face--the face does\nnot signify. It was the face of the photograph, but older, and the teeth\nwere not so numerous as the photographer had suggested, and certainly\nnot so white. Yes, Jacky was past her prime, whatever that prime\nmay have been. She was descending quicker than most women into the\ncolourless years, and the look in her eyes confessed it.\n\n\"What ho!\" said Leonard, greeting the apparition with much spirit, and\nhelping it off with its boa.\n\nJacky, in husky tones, replied, \"What ho!\"\n\n\"Been out?\" he asked. The question sounds superfluous, but it cannot\nhave been really, for the lady answered, \"No,\" adding, \"Oh, I am so\ntired.\"\n\n\"You tired?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I m tired,\" said he, hanging the boa up.\n\n\"Oh, Len, I am so tired.\"\n\n\"I ve been to that classical concert I told you about,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"What s that?\"\n\n\"I came back as soon as it was over.\"\n\n\"Any one been round to our place?\" asked Jacky.\n\n\"Not that I ve seen. I met Mr. Cunningham outside, and we passed a few\nremarks.\"\n\n\"What, not Mr. Cunningham?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean Mr. Cunningham.\"\n\n\"Yes. Mr. Cunningham.\"\n\n\"I ve been out to tea at a lady friend s.\"\n\nHer secret being at last given--to the world, and the name of the lady\nfriend being even adumbrated, Jacky made no further experiments in the\ndifficult and tiring art of conversation. She never had been a great\ntalker. Even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and\nher figure to attract, and now that she was\n\n      \"On the shelf,\n       On the shelf,\n       Boys, boys, I m on the shelf,\"\n\nshe was not likely to find her tongue. Occasional bursts of song (of\nwhich the above is an example) still issued from her lips, but the\nspoken word was rare.\n\nShe sat down on Leonard s knee, and began to fondle him. She was now a\nmassive woman of thirty-three, and her weight hurt him, but he could not\nvery well say anything. Then she said, \"Is that a book you re reading?\"\n and he said, \"That s a book,\" and drew it from her unreluctant grasp.\nMargaret s card fell out of it. It fell face downwards, and he murmured,\n\"Bookmarker.\"\n\n\"Len--\"\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, a little wearily, for she only had one topic of\nconversation when she sat upon his knee.\n\n\"You do love me?\"\n\n\"Jacky, you know that I do. How can you ask such questions!\"\n\n\"But you do love me, Len, don t you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\nA pause. The other remark was still due.\n\n\"Len--\"\n\n\"Well? What is it?\"\n\n\"Len, you will make it all right?\"\n\n\"I can t have you ask me that again,\" said the boy, flaring up into a\nsudden passion. \"I ve promised to marry you when I m of age, and that s\nenough. My word s my word. I ve promised to marry you as soon as ever\nI m twenty-one, and I can t keep on being worried. I ve worries enough.\nIt isn t likely I d throw you over, let alone my word, when I ve spent\nall this money. Besides, I m an Englishman, and I never go back on my\nword. Jacky, do be reasonable. Of course I ll marry you. Only do stop\nbadgering me.\"\n\n\"When s your birthday, Len?\"\n\n\"I ve told you again and again, the eleventh of November next. Now get\noff my knee a bit; some one must get supper, I suppose.\"\n\nJacky went through to the bedroom, and began to see to her hat. This\nmeant blowing at it with short sharp puffs. Leonard tidied up the\nsitting-room, and began to prepare their evening meal. He put a penny\ninto the slot of the gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with\nmetallic fumes. Somehow he could not recover his temper, and all the\ntime he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly.\n\n\"It really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted. It makes one feel so\nwild, when I ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife--all\nright, all right, you SHALL be my wife--and I ve bought you the ring to\nwear, and I ve taken this flat furnished, and it s far more than I can\nafford, and yet you aren t content, and I ve also not told the truth\nwhen I ve written home.\" He lowered his voice. \"He d stop it.\" In a tone\nof horror, that was a little luxurious, he repeated: \"My brother d stop\nit. I m going against the whole world, Jacky.\n\n\"That s what I am, Jacky. I don t take any heed of what any one says. I\njust go straight forward, I do. That s always been my way. I m not one\nof your weak knock-kneed chaps. If a woman s in trouble, I don t leave\nher in the lurch. That s not my street. No, thank you.\n\n\"I ll tell you another thing too. I care a good deal about improving\nmyself by means of Literature and Art, and so getting a wider outlook.\nFor instance, when you came in I was reading Ruskin s Stones of Venice.\nI don t say this to boast, but just to show you the kind of man I am. I\ncan tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon.\"\n\nTo all his moods Jacky remained equally indifferent. When supper was\nready--and not before--she emerged from the bedroom, saying: \"But you do\nlove me, don t you?\"\n\nThey began with a soup square, which Leonard had just dissolved in some\nhot water. It was followed by the tongue--a freckled cylinder of meat,\nwith a little jelly at the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at\nthe bottom--ending with another square dissolved in water (jelly:\npineapple), which Leonard had prepared earlier in the day. Jacky ate\ncontentedly enough, occasionally looking at her man with those anxious\neyes, to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded, and which\nyet seemed to mirror her soul. And Leonard managed to convince his\nstomach that it was having a nourishing meal.\n\nAfter supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements.\nShe observed that her \"likeness\" had been broken. He found occasion to\nremark, for the second time, that he had come straight back home after\nthe concert at Queen s Hall. Presently she sat upon his knee. The\ninhabitants of Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the window,\njust on a level with their heads, and the family in the flat on the\nground-floor began to sing, \"Hark, my soul, it is the Lord.\"\n\n\"That tune fairly gives me the hump,\" said Leonard.\n\nJacky followed this, and said that, for her part, she thought it a\nlovely tune.\n\n\"No; I ll play you something lovely. Get up, dear, for a minute.\"\n\nHe went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg. He played badly and\nvulgarly, but the performance was not without its effect, for Jacky\nsaid she thought she d be going to bed. As she receded, a new set of\ninterests possessed the boy, and he began to think of what had been said\nabout music by that odd Miss Schlegel--the one that twisted her face\nabout so when she spoke. Then the thoughts grew sad and envious. There\nwas the girl named Helen, who had pinched his umbrella, and the German\ngirl who had smiled at him pleasantly, and Herr some one, and Aunt some\none, and the brother--all, all with their hands on the ropes. They had\nall passed up that narrow, rich staircase at Wickham Place to some ample\nroom, whither he could never follow them, not if he read for ten hours\na day. Oh, it was no good, this continual aspiration. Some are born\ncultured; the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy. To see life\nsteadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him.\n\nFrom the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called, \"Len?\"\n\n\"You in bed?\" he asked, his forehead twitching.\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nPresently she called him again.\n\n\"I must clean my boots ready for the morning,\" he answered.\n\nPresently she called him again.\n\n\"I rather want to get this chapter done.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe closed his ears against her.\n\n\"What s that?\"\n\n\"All right, Jacky, nothing; I m reading a book.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What?\" he answered, catching her degraded deafness.\n\nPresently she called him again.\n\nRuskin had visited Torcello by this time, and was ordering his\ngondoliers to take him to Murano. It occurred to him, as he glided over\nthe whispering lagoons, that the power of Nature could not be shortened\nby the folly, nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such\nas Leonard.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII\n\n\"Oh, Margaret,\" cried her aunt next morning, \"such a most unfortunate\nthing has happened. I could not get you alone.\"\n\nThe most unfortunate thing was not very serious. One of the flats in\nthe ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the Wilcox family,\n\"coming up, no doubt, in the hope of getting into London society.\"\n That Mrs. Munt should be the first to discover the misfortune was not\nremarkable, for she was so interested in the flats, that she watched\ntheir every mutation with unwearying care. In theory she despised\nthem--they took away that old-world look--they cut off the sun--flats\nhouse a flashy type of person. But if the truth had been known, she\nfound her visits to Wickham Place twice as amusing since Wickham\nMansions had arisen, and would in a couple of days learn more about\nthem than her nieces in a couple of months, or her nephew in a couple\nof years. She would stroll across and make friends with the porters, and\ninquire what the rents were, exclaiming for example: \"What! a hundred\nand twenty for a basement? You ll never get it!\" And they would answer:\n\"One can but try, madam.\" The passenger lifts, the arrangement for coals\n(a great temptation for a dishonest porter), were all familiar matters\nto her, and perhaps a relief from the politico-economical-esthetic\natmosphere that reigned at the Schlegels.\n\nMargaret received the information calmly, and did not agree that it\nwould throw a cloud over poor Helen s life.\n\n\"Oh, but Helen isn t a girl with no interests,\" she explained. \"She has\nplenty of other things and other people to think about. She made a false\nstart with the Wilcoxes, and she ll be as willing as we are to have\nnothing more to do with them.\"\n\n\"For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly you do talk. Helen ll HAVE to\nhave something more to do with them, now that they re all opposite. She\nmay meet that Paul in the street. She cannot very well not bow.\"\n\n\"Of course she must bow. But look here; let s do the flowers. I was\ngoing to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else\nmatters? I look on that disastrous episode (over which you were so\nkind) as the killing of a nerve in Helen. It s dead, and she ll never be\ntroubled with it again. The only things that matter are the things\nthat interest one. Bowing, even calling and leaving cards, even a\ndinner-party--we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes, if they find\nit agreeable; but the other thing, the one important thing--never again.\nDon t you see?\"\n\nMrs. Munt did not see, and indeed Margaret was making a most\nquestionable statement--that any emotion, any interest once vividly\naroused, can wholly die.\n\n\"I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with\nus. I didn t tell you at the time--it might have made you angry, and you\nhad enough to worry you--but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W, and apologised\nfor the trouble that Helen had given them. She didn t answer it.\"\n\n\"How very rude!\"\n\n\"I wonder. Or was it sensible?\"\n\n\"No, Margaret, most rude.\"\n\n\"In either case one can class it as reassuring.\"\n\nMrs. Munt sighed. She was going back to Swanage on the morrow, just as\nher nieces were wanting her most. Other regrets crowded upon her: for\ninstance, how magnificently she would have cut Charles if she had met\nhim face to face. She had already seen him, giving an order to the\nporter--and very common he looked in a tall hat. But unfortunately his\nback was turned to her, and though she had cut his back, she could not\nregard this as a telling snub.\n\n\"But you will be careful, won t you?\" she exhorted.\n\n\"Oh, certainly. Fiendishly careful.\"\n\n\"And Helen must be careful, too.\"\n\n\"Careful over what?\" cried Helen, at that moment coming into the room\nwith her cousin.\n\n\"Nothing\" said Margaret, seized with a momentary awkwardness.\n\n\"Careful over what, Aunt Juley?\"\n\nMrs. Munt assumed a cryptic air. \"It is only that a certain family,\nwhom we know by name but do not mention, as you said yourself last\nnight after the concert, have taken the flat opposite from the\nMathesons--where the plants are in the balcony.\"\n\nHelen began some laughing reply, and then disconcerted them all by\nblushing. Mrs. Munt was so disconcerted that she exclaimed, \"What,\nHelen, you don t mind them coming, do you?\" and deepened the blush to\ncrimson.\n\n\"Of course I don t mind,\" said Helen a little crossly. \"It is that you\nand Meg are both so absurdly grave about it, when there s nothing to be\ngrave about at all.\"\n\n\"I m not grave,\" protested Margaret, a little cross in her turn.\n\n\"Well, you look grave; doesn t she, Frieda?\"\n\n\"I don t feel grave, that s all I can say; you re going quite on the\nwrong tack.\"\n\n\"No, she does not feel grave,\" echoed Mrs. Munt. \"I can bear witness to\nthat. She disagrees--\"\n\n\"Hark!\" interrupted Fraulein Mosebach. \"I hear Bruno entering the hall.\"\n\nFor Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place to call for the two younger\ngirls. He was not entering the hall--in fact, he did not enter it for\nquite five minutes. But Frieda detected a delicate situation, and said\nthat she and Helen had much better wait for Bruno down below, and\nleave Margaret and Mrs. Munt to finish arranging the flowers. Helen\nacquiesced. But, as if to prove that the situation was not delicate\nreally, she stopped in the doorway and said:\n\n\"Did you say the Mathesons  flat, Aunt Juley? How wonderful you are!\nI never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was\nMatheson.\"\n\n\"Come, Helen,\" said her cousin.\n\n\"Go, Helen,\" said her aunt; and continued to Margaret almost in the same\nbreath: \"Helen cannot deceive me. She does mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush!\" breathed Margaret. \"Frieda ll hear you, and she can be so\ntiresome.\"\n\n\"She minds,\" persisted Mrs. Munt, moving thoughtfully about the room,\nand pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases. \"I knew she d\nmind--and I m sure a girl ought to! Such an experience! Such awful\ncoarse-grained people! I know more about them than you do, which you\nforget, and if Charles had taken you that motor drive--well, you d have\nreached the house a perfect wreck. Oh, Margaret, you don t know what\nyou are in for! They re all bottled up against the drawing-room window.\nThere s Mrs. Wilcox--I ve seen her. There s Paul. There s Evie, who is a\nminx. There s Charles--I saw him to start with. And who would an elderly\nman with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be?\"\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox, possibly.\"\n\n\"I knew it. And there s Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"It s a shame to call his face copper colour,\" complained Margaret. \"He\nhas a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age.\"\n\nMrs. Munt, triumphant elsewhere, could afford to concede Mr. Wilcox\nhis complexion. She passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her\nnieces should pursue in the future. Margaret tried to stop her.\n\n\"Helen did not take the news quite as I expected, but the Wilcox nerve\nis dead in her really, so there s no need for plans.\"\n\n\"It s as well to be prepared.\"\n\n\"No--it s as well not to be prepared.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\nHer thought drew being from the obscure borderland. She could not\nexplain in so many words, but she felt that those who prepare for all\nthe emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the\nexpense of joy. It is necessary to prepare for an examination, or\na dinner-party, or a possible fall in the price of stock: those who\nattempt human relations must adopt another method, or fail. \"Because I d\nsooner risk it,\" was her lame conclusion.\n\n\"But imagine the evenings,\" exclaimed her aunt, pointing to the Mansions\nwith the spout of the watering can. \"Turn the electric light on here\nor there, and it s almost the same room. One evening they may forget to\ndraw their blinds down, and you ll see them; and the next, you yours,\nand they ll see you. Impossible to sit out on the balconies. Impossible\nto water the plants, or even speak. Imagine going out of the front-door,\nand they come out opposite at the same moment. And yet you tell me that\nplans are unnecessary, and you d rather risk it.\"\n\n\"I hope to risk things all my life.\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret, most dangerous.\"\n\n\"But after all,\" she continued with a smile, \"there s never any great\nrisk as long as you have money.\"\n\n\"Oh, shame! What a shocking speech!\"\n\n\"Money pads the edges of things,\" said Miss Schlegel. \"God help those\nwho have none.\"\n\n\"But this is something quite new!\" said Mrs. Munt, who collected new\nideas as a squirrel collects nuts, and was especially attracted by those\nthat are portable.\n\n\"New for me; sensible people have acknowledged it for years. You and I\nand the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands. It is so firm beneath\nour feet that we forget its very existence. It s only when we see some\none near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income\nmeans. Last night, when we were talking up here round the fire, I began\nto think that the very soul of the world is economic, and that the\nlowest abyss is not the absence of love, but the absence of coin.\"\n\n\"I call that rather cynical.\"\n\n\"So do I. But Helen and I, we ought to remember, when we are tempted to\ncriticise others, that we are standing on these islands, and that most\nof the others are down below the surface of the sea. The poor cannot\nalways reach those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever\nescape from those whom they love no longer. We rich can. Imagine the\ntragedy last June, if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor people, and\ncouldn t invoke railways and motor-cars to part them.\"\n\n\"That s more like Socialism,\" said Mrs. Munt suspiciously.\n\n\"Call it what you like. I call it going through life with one s hand\nspread open on the table. I m tired of these rich people who pretend\nto be poor, and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money\nthat keep their feet above the waves. I stand each year upon six hundred\npounds, and Helen upon the same, and Tibby will stand upon eight, and as\nfast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed--from\nthe sea, yes, from the sea. And all our thoughts are the thoughts of\nsix-hundred-pounders, and all our speeches; and because we don t want to\nsteal umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below the sea people do want\nto steal them and do steal them sometimes, and that what s a joke up\nhere is down there reality.\"\n\n\"There they go--there goes Fraulein Mosebach. Really, for a German she\ndoes dress charmingly. Oh!--\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes  flat.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn t she?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you were saying about\nreality?\"\n\n\"I had worked round to myself, as usual,\" answered Margaret in tones\nthat were suddenly preoccupied.\n\n\"Do tell me this, at all events. Are you for the rich or for the poor?\"\n\n\"Too difficult. Ask me another. Am I for poverty or for riches? For\nriches. Hurrah for riches!\"\n\n\"For riches!\" echoed Mrs. Munt, having, as it were, at last secured her\nnut.\n\n\"Yes. For riches. Money for ever!\"\n\n\"So am I, and so, I am afraid, are most of my acquaintances at Swanage,\nbut I am surprised that you agree with us.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much, Aunt Juley. While I have talked theories, you have\ndone the flowers.\"\n\n\"Not at all, dear. I wish you would let me help you in more important\nthings.\"\n\n\"Well, would you be very kind? Would you come round with me to the\nregistry office? There s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say\nno.\"\n\nOn their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes  flat. Evie was\nin the balcony, \"staring most rudely,\" according to Mrs. Munt. Oh yes,\nit was a nuisance, there was no doubt of it. Helen was proof against\na passing encounter, but--Margaret began to lose confidence. Might it\nreawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her\neyes? And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight,\nand Frieda was sharp, abominably sharp, and quite capable of remarking,\n\"You love one of the young gentlemen opposite, yes?\" The remark would be\nuntrue, but of the kind which, if stated often enough, may become true;\njust as the remark, \"England and Germany are bound to fight,\" renders\nwar a little more likely each time that it is made, and is therefore\nmade the more readily by the gutter press of either nation. Have the\nprivate emotions also their gutter press? Margaret thought so, and\nfeared that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of it.\nThey might, by continual chatter, lead Helen into a repetition of the\ndesires of June. Into a repetition--they could not do more; they\ncould not lead her into lasting love. They were--she saw it\nclearly--Journalism; her father, with all his defects and\nwrong-headedness, had been Literature, and had he lived, he would have\npersuaded his daughter rightly.\n\nThe registry office was holding its morning reception. A string of\ncarriages filled the street. Miss Schlegel waited her turn, and finally\nhad to be content with an insidious \"temporary,\" being rejected by\ngenuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs. Her failure\ndepressed her, and though she forgot the failure, the depression\nremained. On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes  flat,\nand took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to Helen.\n\n\"Helen, you must tell me whether this thing worries you.\"\n\n\"If what?\" said Helen, who was washing her hands for lunch.\n\n\"The Ws  coming.\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Really.\" Then she admitted that she was a little worried on Mrs.\nWilcox s account; she implied that Mrs. Wilcox might reach backward\ninto deep feelings, and be pained by things that never touched the other\nmembers of that clan. \"I shan t mind if Paul points at our house and\nsays,  There lives the girl who tried to catch me.  But she might.\"\n\n\"If even that worries you, we could arrange something. There s no reason\nwe should be near people who displease us or whom we displease, thanks\nto our money. We might even go away for a little.\"\n\n\"Well, I am going away. Frieda s just asked me to Stettin, and I shan t\nbe back till after the New Year. Will that do? Or must I fly the country\naltogether? Really, Meg, what has come over you to make such a fuss?\"\n\n\"Oh, I m getting an old maid, I suppose. I thought I minded nothing, but\nreally I--I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice\nand\"--she cleared her throat--\"you did go red, you know, when Aunt Juley\nattacked you this morning. I shouldn t have referred to it otherwise.\"\n\nBut Helen s laugh rang true, as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and\nswore that never, nowhere and nohow, would she again fall in love with\nany of the Wilcox family, down to its remotest collaterals.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VIII\n\nThe friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which was to develop\nso quickly and with such strange results, may perhaps have had its\nbeginnings at Speyer, in the spring. Perhaps the elder lady, as she\ngazed at the vulgar, ruddy cathedral, and listened to the talk of her\nhusband and Helen, may have detected in the other and less charming of\nthe sisters a deeper sympathy, a sounder judgment. She was capable\nof detecting such things. Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss\nSchlegels to be invited to Howards End, and Margaret whose presence she\nhad particularly desired. All this is speculation; Mrs. Wilcox has left\nfew clear indications behind her. It is certain that she came to call at\nWickham Place a fortnight later, the very day that Helen was going with\nher cousin to Stettin.\n\n\"Helen!\" cried Fraulein Mosebach in awestruck tones (she was now in\nher cousin s confidence)--\"his mother has forgiven you!\" And then,\nremembering that in England the new-comer ought not to call before she\nis called upon, she changed her tone from awe to disapproval, and opined\nthat Mrs. Wilcox was keine Dame.\n\n\"Bother the whole family!\" snapped Margaret. \"Helen, stop giggling and\npirouetting, and go and finish your packing. Why can t the woman leave\nus alone?\"\n\n\"I don t know what I shall do with Meg,\" Helen retorted, collapsing upon\nthe stairs. \"She s got Wilcox and Box upon the brain. Meg, Meg, I don t\nlove the young gentleman; I don t love the young gentleman, Meg, Meg.\nCan a body speak plainer?\"\n\n\"Most certainly her love has died,\" asserted Fraulein Mosebach.\n\n\"Most certainly it has, Frieda, but that will not prevent me from being\nbored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call.\"\n\nThen Helen simulated tears, and Fraulein Mosebach, who thought her\nextremely amusing, did the same. \"Oh, boo hoo! boo hoo hoo! Meg s\ngoing to return the call, and I can t.  Cos why?  Cos I m going to\nGerman-eye.\"\n\n\"If you are going to Germany, go and pack; if you aren t, go and call on\nthe Wilcoxes instead of me.\"\n\n\"But, Meg, Meg, I don t love the young gentleman; I don t love the\nyoung--O lud, who s that coming down the stairs? I vow  tis my brother.\nO crimini!\"\n\nA male--even such a male as Tibby--was enough to stop the foolery. The\nbarrier of sex, though decreasing among the civilised, is still high,\nand higher on the side of women. Helen could tell her sister all, and\nher cousin much about Paul; she told her brother nothing. It was not\nprudishness, for she now spoke of \"the Wilcox ideal\" with laughter, and\neven with a growing brutality. Nor was it precaution, for Tibby seldom\nrepeated any news that did not concern himself. It was rather the\nfeeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men, and that,\nhowever trivial it was on this side of the barrier, it would become\nimportant on that. So she stopped, or rather began to fool on other\nsubjects, until her long-suffering relatives drove her upstairs.\nFraulein Mosebach followed her, but lingered to say heavily over the\nbanisters to Margaret, \"It is all right--she does not love the young\nman--he has not been worthy of her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know; thanks very much.\"\n\n\"I thought I did right to tell you.\"\n\n\"Ever so many thanks.\"\n\n\"What s that?\" asked Tibby. No one told him, and he proceeded into the\ndining-room, to eat plums.\n\nThat evening Margaret took decisive action. The house was very quiet,\nand the fog--we are in November now--pressed against the windows like an\nexcluded ghost. Frieda and Helen and all their luggages had gone. Tibby,\nwho was not feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the fire. Margaret\nsat by him, thinking. Her mind darted from impulse to impulse, and\nfinally marshalled them all in review. The practical person, who knows\nwhat he wants at once, and generally knows nothing else, will accuse her\nof indecision. But this was the way her mind worked. And when she did\nact, no one could accuse her of indecision then. She hit out as lustily\nas if she had not considered the matter at all. The letter that she\nwrote Mrs. Wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution. The pale\ncast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish, a breath\nthat leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away.\n\n\n\"DEAR MRS. WILCOX,\"\n\n\"I have to write something discourteous. It would be better if we did\nnot meet. Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your\nfamily, and, in my sister s case, the grounds for displeasure might\nrecur. So far as I know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your\nson. But it would not be fair, either to her or to you, if they met, and\nit is therefore right that our acquaintance, which began so pleasantly,\nshould end.\"\n\n\"I fear that you will not agree with this; indeed, I know that you\nwill not, since you have been good enough to call on us. It is only\nan instinct on my part, and no doubt the instinct is wrong. My sister\nwould, undoubtedly, say that it is wrong. I write without her knowledge,\nand I hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\"\n\n\"Yours truly,\"\n\n\"M. J. SCHLEGEL.\"\n\n\nMargaret sent this letter round by the post. Next morning she received\nthe following reply by hand:\n\n\n\"DEAR MISS SCHLEGEL,\"\n\n\"You should not have written me such a letter. I called to tell you that\nPaul has gone abroad.\"\n\n\"RUTH WILCOX.\"\n\n\nMargaret s cheeks burnt. She could not finish her breakfast. She was on\nfire with shame. Helen had told her that the youth was leaving England,\nbut other things had seemed more important, and she had forgotten. All\nher absurd anxieties fell to the ground, and in their place arose the\ncertainty that she had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox. Rudeness affected\nMargaret like a bitter taste in the mouth. It poisoned life. At times it\nis necessary, but woe to those who employ it without due need. She flung\non a hat and shawl, just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog,\nwhich still continued. Her lips were compressed, the letter remained in\nher hand, and in this state she crossed the street, entered the marble\nvestibule of the flats, eluded the concierges, and ran up the stairs\ntill she reached the second floor. She sent in her name, and to her\nsurprise was shown straight into Mrs. Wilcox s bedroom.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, I have made the baddest blunder. I am more, more\nashamed and sorry than I can say.\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox bowed gravely. She was offended, and did not pretend to the\ncontrary. She was sitting up in bed, writing letters on an invalid table\nthat spanned her knees. A breakfast tray was on another table beside\nher. The light of the fire, the light from the window, and the light of\na candle-lamp, which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to\ncreate a strange atmosphere of dissolution.\n\n\"I knew he was going to India in November, but I forgot.\"\n\n\"He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria, in Africa.\"\n\n\"I knew--I know. I have been too absurd all through. I am very much\nashamed.\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox did not answer.\n\n\"I am more sorry than I can say, and I hope that you will forgive me.\"\n\n\"It doesn t matter, Miss Schlegel. It is good of you to have come round\nso promptly.\"\n\n\"It does matter,\" cried Margaret. \"I have been rude to you; and my\nsister is not even at home, so there was not even that excuse.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"She has just gone to Germany.\"\n\n\"She gone as well,\" murmured the other. \"Yes, certainly, it is quite\nsafe--safe, absolutely, now.\"\n\n\"You ve been worrying too!\" exclaimed Margaret, getting more and\nmore excited, and taking a chair without invitation. \"How perfectly\nextraordinary! I can see that you have. You felt as I do; Helen mustn t\nmeet him again.\"\n\n\"I did think it best.\"\n\n\"Now why?\"\n\n\"That s a most difficult question,\" said Mrs. Wilcox, smiling, and a\nlittle losing her expression of annoyance. \"I think you put it best in\nyour letter--it was an instinct, which may be wrong.\"\n\n\"It wasn t that your son still--\"\n\n\"Oh no; he often--my Paul is very young, you see.\"\n\n\"Then what was it?\"\n\nShe repeated: \"An instinct which may be wrong.\"\n\n\"In other words, they belong to types that can fall in love, but\ncouldn t live together. That s dreadfully probable. I m afraid that in\nnine cases out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another.\"\n\n\"These are indeed  other words, \" said Mrs. Wilcox. \"I had nothing so\ncoherent in my head. I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared\nfor your sister.\"\n\n\"Ah, I have always been wanting to ask you. How DID you know? Helen\nwas so surprised when our aunt drove up, and you stepped forward and\narranged things. Did Paul tell you?\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be gained by discussing that,\" said Mrs. Wilcox\nafter a moment s pause.\n\n\"Mrs. Wilcox, were you very angry with us last June? I wrote you a\nletter and you didn t answer it.\"\n\n\"I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson s flat. I knew it was\nopposite your house.\"\n\n\"But it s all right now?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"You only think? You aren t sure? I do love these little muddles tidied\nup?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I m sure,\" said Mrs. Wilcox, moving with uneasiness beneath\nthe clothes. \"I always sound uncertain over things. It is my way of\nspeaking.\"\n\n\"That s all right, and I m sure, too.\"\n\nHere the maid came in to remove the breakfast-tray. They were\ninterrupted, and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal\nlines.\n\n\"I must say good-bye now--you will be getting up.\"\n\n\"No--please stop a little longer--I am taking a day in bed. Now and then\nI do.\"\n\n\"I thought of you as one of the early risers.\"\n\n\"At Howards End--yes; there is nothing to get up for in London.\"\n\n\"Nothing to get up for?\" cried the scandalised Margaret. \"When there are\nall the autumn exhibitions, and Ysaye playing in the afternoon! Not to\nmention people.\"\n\n\"The truth is, I am a little tired. First came the wedding, and then\nPaul went off, and, instead of resting yesterday, I paid a round of\ncalls.\"\n\n\"A wedding?\"\n\n\"Yes; Charles, my elder son, is married.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"We took the flat chiefly on that account, and also that Paul could get\nhis African outfit. The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s, and\nshe most kindly offered it to us. So before the day came we were able to\nmake the acquaintance of Dolly s people, which we had not yet done.\"\n\nMargaret asked who Dolly s people were.\n\n\"Fussell. The father is in the Indian army--retired; the brother is in\nthe army. The mother is dead.\"\n\nSo perhaps these were the \"chinless sunburnt men\" whom Helen had espied\none afternoon through the window. Margaret felt mildly interested in\nthe fortunes of the Wilcox family. She had acquired the habit on Helen s\naccount, and it still clung to her. She asked for more information\nabout Miss Dolly Fussell that was, and was given it in even, unemotional\ntones. Mrs. Wilcox s voice, though sweet and compelling, had little\nrange of expression. It suggested that pictures, concerts, and people\nare all of small and equal value. Only once had it quickened--when\nspeaking of Howards End.\n\n\"Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time. They\nbelong to the same club, and are both devoted to golf. Dolly plays\ngolf too, though I believe not so well; and they first met in a mixed\nfoursome. We all like her, and are very much pleased. They were married\non the 11th, a few days before Paul sailed. Charles was very anxious to\nhave his brother as best man, so he made a great point of having it on\nthe 11th. The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas, but they\nwere very nice about it. There is Dolly s photograph--in that double\nframe.\"\n\n\"Are you quite certain that I m not interrupting, Mrs. Wilcox?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite.\"\n\n\"Then I will stay. I m enjoying this.\"\n\nDolly s photograph was now examined. It was signed \"For dear Mims,\"\n which Mrs. Wilcox interpreted as \"the name she and Charles had settled\nthat she should call me.\" Dolly looked silly, and had one of those\ntriangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man. She\nwas very pretty. From her Margaret passed to Charles, whose features\nprevailed opposite. She speculated on the forces that had drawn the two\ntogether till God parted them. She found time to hope that they would be\nhappy.\n\n\"They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon.\"\n\n\"Lucky people!\"\n\n\"I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy.\"\n\n\"Doesn t he care for travelling?\"\n\n\"He likes travel, but he does see through foreigners so. What he enjoys\nmost is a motor tour in England, and I think that would have carried the\nday if the weather had not been so abominable. His father gave him a car\nfor a wedding present, which for the present is being stored at Howards\nEnd.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have a garage there?\"\n\n\"Yes. My husband built a little one only last month, to the west of the\nhouse, not far from the wych-elm, in what used to be the paddock for the\npony.\"\n\nThe last words had an indescribable ring about them.\n\n\"Where s the pony gone?\" asked Margaret after a pause.\n\n\"The pony? Oh, dead, ever so long ago.\"\n\n\"The wych-elm I remember. Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree.\"\n\n\"It is the finest wych-elm in Hertfordshire. Did your sister tell you\nabout the teeth?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, it might interest you. There are pigs  teeth stuck into the trunk,\nabout four feet from the ground. The country people put them in long\nago, and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark, it will cure\nthe toothache. The teeth are almost grown over now, and no one comes to\nthe tree.\"\n\n\"I should. I love folklore and all festering superstitions.\"\n\n\"Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed\nin it?\"\n\n\"Of course it did. It would cure anything--once.\"\n\n\"Certainly I remember cases--you see I lived at Howards End long, long\nbefore Mr. Wilcox knew it. I was born there.\"\n\nThe conversation again shifted. At the time it seemed little more than\naimless chatter. She was interested when her hostess explained that\nHowards End was her own property. She was bored when too minute an\naccount was given of the Fussell family, of the anxieties of Charles\nconcerning Naples, of the movements of Mr. Wilcox and Evie, who were\nmotoring in Yorkshire. Margaret could not bear being bored. She grew\ninattentive, played with the photograph frame, dropped it, smashed\nDolly s glass, apologised, was pardoned, cut her finger thereon,\nwas pitied, and finally said she must be going--there was all the\nhousekeeping to do, and she had to interview Tibby s riding-master.\n\nThen the curious note was struck again.\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Schlegel, good-bye. Thank you for coming. You have\ncheered me up.\"\n\n\"I m so glad!\"\n\n\"I--I wonder whether you ever think about yourself?\"\n\n\"I think of nothing else,\" said Margaret, blushing, but letting her hand\nremain in that of the invalid.\n\n\"I wonder. I wondered at Heidelberg.\"\n\n\"I M sure!\"\n\n\"I almost think--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" asked Margaret, for there was a long pause--a pause that was\nsomehow akin to the flicker of the fire, the quiver of the reading-lamp\nupon their hands, the white blur from the window; a pause of shifting\nand eternal shadows.\n\n\"I almost think you forget you re a girl.\"\n\nMargaret was startled and a little annoyed. \"I m twenty-nine,\" she\nremarked. \"That s not so wildly girlish.\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox smiled.\n\n\"What makes you say that? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude?\"\n\nA shake of the head. \"I only meant that I am fifty-one, and that to\nme both of you--Read it all in some book or other; I cannot put things\nclearly.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ve got it--inexperience. I m no better than Helen, you mean, and\nyet I presume to advise her.\"\n\n\"Yes. You have got it. Inexperience is the word.\"\n\n\"Inexperience,\" repeated Margaret, in serious yet buoyant tones.\n\n\"Of course, I have everything to learn--absolutely everything--just\nas much as Helen. Life s very difficult and full of surprises. At all\nevents, I ve got as far as that. To be humble and kind, to go\nstraight ahead, to love people rather than pity them, to remember the\nsubmerged--well, one can t do all these things at once, worse luck,\nbecause they re so contradictory. It s then that proportion comes in--to\nlive by proportion. Don t BEGIN with proportion. Only prigs do that.\nLet proportion come in as a last resource, when the better things have\nfailed, and a deadlock--Gracious me, I ve started preaching!\"\n\n\"Indeed, you put the difficulties of life splendidly,\" said Mrs. Wilcox,\nwithdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows. \"It is just what I should\nhave liked to say about them myself.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IX\n\nMrs. Wilcox cannot be accused of giving Margaret much information about\nlife. And Margaret, on the other hand, has made a fair show of modesty,\nand has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel.\nShe had kept house for over ten years; she had entertained, almost with\ndistinction; she had brought up a charming sister, and was bringing up\na brother. Surely, if experience is attainable, she had attained it. Yet\nthe little luncheon-party that she gave in Mrs. Wilcox s honour was not\na success. The new friend did not blend with the \"one or two delightful\npeople\" who had been asked to meet her, and the atmosphere was one of\npolite bewilderment. Her tastes were simple, her knowledge of culture\nslight, and she was not interested in the New English Art Club, nor in\nthe dividing-line between Journalism and Literature, which was started\nas a conversational hare. The delightful people darted after it with\ncries of joy, Margaret leading them, and not till the meal was half\nover did they realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the\nchase. There was no common topic. Mrs. Wilcox, whose life had been spent\nin the service of husband and sons, had little to say to strangers who\nhad never shared it, and whose age was half her own. Clever talk alarmed\nher, and withered her delicate imaginings; it was the social counterpart\nof a motor-car, all jerks, and she was a wisp of hay, a flower. Twice\nshe deplored the weather, twice criticised the train service on the\nGreat Northern Railway. They vigorously assented, and rushed on, and\nwhen she inquired whether there was any news of Helen, her hostess was\ntoo much occupied in placing Rothenstein to answer. The question was\nrepeated: \"I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now.\" Margaret\nchecked herself and said, \"Yes, thank you; I heard on Tuesday.\" But the\ndemon of vociferation was in her, and the next moment she was off again.\n\n\"Only on Tuesday, for they live right away at Stettin. Did you ever know\nany one living at Stettin?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Wilcox gravely, while her neighbour, a young man low\ndown in the Education Office, began to discuss what people who lived\nat Stettin ought to look like. Was there such a thing as Stettininity?\nMargaret swept on.\n\n\"People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses.\nAt least, our cousins do, but aren t particularly rich. The town isn t\ninteresting, except for a clock that rolls its eyes, and the view of the\nOder, which truly is something special. Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, you would\nlove the Oder! The river, or rather rivers--there seem to be dozens\nof them--are intense blue, and the plain they run through an intensest\ngreen.\"\n\n\"Indeed! That sounds like a most beautiful view, Miss Schlegel.\"\n\n\"So I say, but Helen, who will muddle things, says no, it s like music.\nThe course of the Oder is to be like music. It s obliged to remind her\nof a symphonic poem. The part by the landing-stage is in B minor, if I\nremember rightly, but lower down things get extremely mixed. There is a\nslodgy theme in several keys at once, meaning mud-banks, and another for\nthe navigable canal, and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major,\npianissimo.\"\n\n\"What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?\" asked the man,\nlaughing.\n\n\"They make a great deal of it,\" replied Margaret, unexpectedly rushing\noff on a new track. \"I think it s affectation to compare the Oder to\nmusic, and so do you, but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take\nbeauty seriously, which we don t, and the average Englishman doesn t,\nand despises all who do. Now don t say  Germans have no taste,  or I\nshall scream. They haven t. But--but--such a tremendous but!--they take\npoetry seriously. They do take poetry seriously.\"\n\n\"Is anything gained by that?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. The German is always on the lookout for beauty. He may miss\nit through stupidity, or misinterpret it, but he is always asking\nbeauty to enter his life, and I believe that in the end it will come. At\nHeidelberg I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as\nhe repeated some mawkish poetry. So easy for me to laugh--I, who never\nrepeat poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember one fragment of verse\nto thrill myself with. My blood boils--well, I m half German, so put\nit down to patriotism--when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the\naverage islander for things Teutonic, whether they re Bocklin or my\nveterinary surgeon.  Oh, Bocklin,  they say;  he strains after beauty,\nhe peoples Nature with gods too consciously.  Of course Bocklin strains,\nbecause he wants something--beauty and all the other intangible gifts\nthat are floating about the world. So his landscapes don t come off, and\nLeader s do.\"\n\n\"I am not sure that I agree. Do you?\" said he, turning to Mrs. Wilcox.\n\nShe replied: \"I think Miss Schlegel puts everything splendidly;\" and a\nchill fell on the conversation.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, say something nicer than that. It s such a snub to be\ntold you put things splendidly.\"\n\n\"I do not mean it as a snub. Your last speech interested me so much.\nGenerally people do not seem quite to like Germany. I have long wanted\nto hear what is said on the other side.\"\n\n\"The other side? Then you do disagree. Oh, good! Give us your side.\"\n\n\"I have no side. But my husband\"--her voice softened, the chill\nincreased--\"has very little faith in the Continent, and our children\nhave all taken after him.\"\n\n\"On what grounds? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form?\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox had no idea; she paid little attention to grounds. She was\nnot intellectual, nor even alert, and it was odd that, all the same, she\nshould give the idea of greatness. Margaret, zigzagging with her friends\nover Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that transcended\ntheir own and dwarfed their activities. There was no bitterness in Mrs.\nWilcox; there was not even criticism; she was lovable, and no ungracious\nor uncharitable word had passed her lips. Yet she and daily life were\nout of focus; one or the other must show blurred. And at lunch she\nseemed more out of focus than usual, and nearer the line that divides\ndaily life from a life that may be of greater importance.\n\n\"You will admit, though, that the Continent--it seems silly to speak of\n the Continent,  but really it is all more like itself than any part of\nit is like England. England is unique. Do have another jelly first. I\nwas going to say that the Continent, for good or for evil, is interested\nin ideas. Its Literature and Art have what one might call the kink of\nthe unseen about them, and this persists even through decadence and\naffectation. There is more liberty of action in England, but for liberty\nof thought go to bureaucratic Prussia. People will there discuss with\nhumility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch\nwith tongs.\"\n\n\"I do not want to go to Prussia,\" said Mrs. Wilcox \"not even to see\nthat interesting view that you were describing. And for discussing with\nhumility I am too old. We never discuss anything at Howards End.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to!\" said Margaret. \"Discussion keeps a house alive. It\ncannot stand by bricks and mortar alone.\"\n\n\"It cannot stand without them,\" said Mrs. Wilcox, unexpectedly catching\non to the thought, and rousing, for the first and last time, a faint\nhope in the breasts of the delightful people. \"It cannot stand without\nthem, and I sometimes think--But I cannot expect your generation to\nagree, for even my daughter disagrees with me here.\"\n\n\"Never mind us or her. Do say!\"\n\n\"I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to\nmen.\"\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\"One admits that the arguments against the suffrage ARE extraordinarily\nstrong,\" said a girl opposite, leaning forward and crumbling her bread.\n\n\"Are they? I never follow any arguments. I am only too thankful not to\nhave a vote myself.\"\n\n\"We didn t mean the vote, though, did we?\" supplied Margaret. \"Aren t\nwe differing on something much wider, Mrs. Wilcox? Whether women are to\nremain what they have been since the dawn of history; or whether, since\nmen have moved forward so far, they too may move forward a little now. I\nsay they may. I would even admit a biological change.\"\n\n\"I don t know, I don t know.\"\n\n\"I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse,\" said the man.\n\"They ve turned disgracefully strict.\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox also rose.\n\n\"Oh, but come upstairs for a little. Miss Quested plays. Do you like\nMacDowell? Do you mind his only having two noises? If you must really\ngo, I ll see you out. Won t you even have coffee?\"\n\nThey left the dining-room closing the door behind them, and as Mrs.\nWilcox buttoned up her jacket, she said: \"What an interesting life you\nall lead in London!\"\n\n\"No, we don t,\" said Margaret, with a sudden revulsion. \"We lead the\nlives of gibbering monkeys. Mrs. Wilcox--really--We have something quiet\nand stable at the bottom. We really have. All my friends have. Don t\npretend you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it, but forgive me by coming\nagain, alone, or by asking me to you.\"\n\n\"I am used to young people,\" said Mrs. Wilcox, and with each word she\nspoke the outlines of known things grew dim. \"I hear a great deal of\nchatter at home, for we, like you, entertain a great deal. With us it\nis more sport and politics, but--I enjoyed my lunch very much, Miss\nSchlegel, dear, and am not pretending, and only wish I could have joined\nin more. For one thing, I m not particularly well just to-day. For\nanother, you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me. Charles\nis the same, Dolly the same. But we are all in the same boat, old and\nyoung. I never forget that.\"\n\nThey were silent for a moment. Then, with a newborn emotion, they shook\nhands. The conversation ceased suddenly when Margaret re-entered the\ndining-room; her friends had been talking over her new friend, and had\ndismissed her as uninteresting.\n\n\n\n",

At Heidelberg I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry. So easy for me to laugh--I, who never repeat poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with. My blood boils--well, I m half German, so put it down to patriotism--when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things Teutonic, whether they re Bocklin or my veterinary surgeon.  Oh, Bocklin,  they say;  he strains after beauty, he peoples Nature with gods too consciously.  Of course Bocklin strains, because he wants something--beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world. So his landscapes don t come off, and Leader s do."

        "raw text": " X\n\nSeveral days passed.\n\nWas Mrs. Wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people--there are many of\nthem--who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it? They evoke our interests\nand affections, and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them.\nThen they withdraw. When physical passion is involved, there is a\ndefinite name for such behaviour--flirting--and if carried far enough\nit is punishable by law. But no law--not public opinion even--punishes\nthose who coquette with friendship, though the dull ache that they\ninflict, the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion, may be as\nintolerable. Was she one of these?\n\nMargaret feared so at first, for, with a Londoner s impatience, she\nwanted everything to be settled up immediately. She mistrusted the\nperiods of quiet that are essential to true growth. Desiring to book\nMrs. Wilcox as a friend, she pressed on the ceremony, pencil, as it\nwere, in hand, pressing the more because the rest of the family were\naway, and the opportunity seemed favourable. But the elder woman would\nnot be hurried. She refused to fit in with the Wickham Place set, or to\nreopen discussion of Helen and Paul, whom Margaret would have utilised\nas a short-cut. She took her time, or perhaps let time take her, and\nwhen the crisis did come all was ready.\n\nThe crisis opened with a message: Would Miss Schlegel come shopping?\nChristmas was nearing, and Mrs. Wilcox felt behindhand with the\npresents. She had taken some more days in bed, and must make up for lost\ntime. Margaret accepted, and at eleven o clock one cheerless morning\nthey started out in a brougham.\n\n\"First of all,\" began Margaret, \"we must make a list and tick off the\npeople s names. My aunt always does, and this fog may thicken up any\nmoment. Have you any ideas?\"\n\n\"I thought we would go to Harrods or the Haymarket Stores,\" said Mrs.\nWilcox rather hopelessly. \"Everything is sure to be there. I am not a\ngood shopper. The din is so confusing, and your aunt is quite right--one\nought to make a list. Take my notebook, then, and write your own name at\nthe top of the page.\"\n\n\"Oh, hooray!\" said Margaret, writing it. \"How very kind of you to start\nwith me!\" But she did not want to receive anything expensive. Their\nacquaintance was singular rather than intimate, and she divined that the\nWilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders; the more compact\nfamilies do. She did not want to be thought a second Helen, who would\nsnatch presents since she could not snatch young men, nor to be exposed\nlike a second Aunt Juley, to the insults of Charles. A certain austerity\nof demeanour was best, and she added: \"I don t really want a Yuletide\ngift, though. In fact, I d rather not.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I ve odd ideas about Christmas. Because I have all that money\ncan buy. I want more people, but no more things.\"\n\n\"I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance, Miss\nSchlegel, in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight.\nIt has so happened that I have been left alone, and you have stopped me\nfrom brooding. I am too apt to brood.\"\n\n\"If that is so,\" said Margaret, \"if I have happened to be of use to you,\nwhich I didn t know, you cannot pay me back with anything tangible.\"\n\n\"I suppose not, but one would like to. Perhaps I shall think of\nsomething as we go about.\"\n\nHer name remained at the head of the list, but nothing was written\nopposite it. They drove from shop to shop. The air was white, and when\nthey alighted it tasted like cold pennies. At times they passed through\na clot of grey. Mrs. Wilcox s vitality was low that morning, and it was\nMargaret who decided on a horse for this little girl, a golliwog for\nthat, for the rector s wife a copper warming-tray. \"We always give the\nservants money.\" \"Yes, do you, yes, much easier,\" replied Margaret but\nfelt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen, and saw issuing\nfrom a forgotten manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys.\nVulgarity reigned. Public-houses, besides their usual exhortation\nagainst temperance reform, invited men to \"Join our Christmas goose\nclub\"--one bottle of gin, etc., or two, according to subscription. A\nposter of a woman in tights heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little\nred devils, who had come in again that year, were prevalent upon the\nChristmas-cards. Margaret was no morbid idealist. She did not wish\nthis spate of business and self-advertisement checked. It was only the\noccasion of it that struck her with amazement annually. How many of\nthese vacillating shoppers and tired shop-assistants realised that it\nwas a divine event that drew them together? She realised it, though\nstanding outside in the matter. She was not a Christian in the accepted\nsense; she did not believe that God had ever worked among us as a young\nartisan. These people, or most of them, believed it, and if pressed,\nwould affirm it in words. But the visible signs of their belief were\nRegent Street or Drury Lane, a little mud displaced, a little money\nspent, a little food cooked, eaten, and forgotten. Inadequate. But in\npublic who shall express the unseen adequately? It is private life that\nholds out the mirror to infinity; personal intercourse, and that alone,\nthat ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision.\n\n\"No, I do like Christmas on the whole,\" she announced. \"In its clumsy\nway, it does approach Peace and Goodwill. But oh, it is clumsier every\nyear.\"\n\n\"Is it? I am only used to country Christmases.\"\n\n\"We are usually in London, and play the game with vigour--carols at\nthe Abbey, clumsy midday meal, clumsy dinner for the maids, followed by\nChristmas-tree and dancing of poor children, with songs from Helen.\nThe drawing-room does very well for that. We put the tree in the\npowder-closet, and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted, and with\nthe looking-glass behind it looks quite pretty. I wish we might have\na powder-closet in our next house. Of course, the tree has to be very\nsmall, and the presents don t hang on it. No; the presents reside in a\nsort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper.\"\n\n\"You spoke of your  next house,  Miss Schlegel. Then are you leaving\nWickham Place?\"\n\n\"Yes, in two or three years, when the lease expires. We must.\"\n\n\"Have you been there long?\"\n\n\"All our lives.\"\n\n\"You will be very sorry to leave it.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. We scarcely realise it yet. My father--\" She broke off,\nfor they had reached the stationery department of the Haymarket Stores,\nand Mrs. Wilcox wanted to order some private greeting cards.\n\n\"If possible, something distinctive,\" she sighed. At the counter\nshe found a friend, bent on the same errand, and conversed with\nher insipidly, wasting much time. \"My husband and our daughter are\nmotoring.\" \"Bertha, too? Oh, fancy, what a coincidence!\"\n\nMargaret, though not practical, could shine in such company as this.\nWhile they talked, she went through a volume of specimen cards,\nand submitted one for Mrs. Wilcox s inspection. Mrs. Wilcox was\ndelighted--so original, words so sweet; she would order a hundred\nlike that, and could never be sufficiently grateful. Then, just as the\nassistant was booking the order, she said: \"Do you know, I ll wait. On\nsecond thoughts, I ll wait. There s plenty of time still, isn t there,\nand I shall be able to get Evie s opinion.\"\n\nThey returned to the carriage by devious paths; when they were in, she\nsaid, \"But couldn t you get it renewed?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"The lease, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, the lease! Have you been thinking of that all the time? How very\nkind of you!\"\n\n\"Surely something could be done.\"\n\n\"No; values have risen too enormously. They mean to pull down Wickham\nPlace, and build flats like yours.\"\n\n\"But how horrible!\"\n\n\"Landlords are horrible.\"\n\nThen she said vehemently: \"It is monstrous, Miss Schlegel; it isn t\nright. I had no idea that this was hanging over you. I do pity you from\nthe bottom of my heart. To be parted from your house, your father s\nhouse--it oughtn t to be allowed. It is worse than dying. I would rather\ndie than--Oh, poor girls! Can what they call civilisation be right, if\npeople mayn t die in the room where they were born? My dear, I am so\nsorry.\"\n\nMargaret did not know what to say. Mrs. Wilcox had been overtired by the\nshopping, and was inclined to hysteria.\n\n\"Howards End was nearly pulled down once. It would have killed me.\"\n\n\"I--Howards End must be a very different house to ours. We are fond of\nours, but there is nothing distinctive about it. As you saw, it is an\nordinary London house. We shall easily find another.\"\n\n\"So you think.\"\n\n\"Again my lack of experience, I suppose!\" said Margaret, easing away\nfrom the subject. \"I can t say anything when you take up that line, Mrs.\nWilcox. I wish I could see myself as you see me--foreshortened into a\nbackfisch. Quite the ingenue. Very charming--wonderfully well read for\nmy age, but incapable--\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox would not be deterred. \"Come down with me to Howards End\nnow,\" she said, more vehemently than ever. \"I want you to see it. You\nhave never seen it. I want to hear what you say about it, for you do put\nthings so wonderfully.\"\n\nMargaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her\ncompanion. \"Later on I should love it,\" she continued, \"but it s hardly\nthe weather for such an expedition, and we ought to start when we re\nfresh. Isn t the house shut up, too?\"\n\nShe received no answer. Mrs. Wilcox appeared to be annoyed.\n\n\"Might I come some other day?\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass. \"Back to Wickham Place,\nplease!\" was her order to the coachman. Margaret had been snubbed.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, Miss Schlegel, for all your help.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind--the\nChristmas-cards especially. I do admire your choice.\"\n\nIt was her turn to receive no answer. In her turn Margaret became\nannoyed.\n\n\"My husband and Evie will be back the day after to-morrow. That is why\nI dragged you out shopping to-day. I stayed in town chiefly to shop,\nbut got through nothing, and now he writes that they must cut their\ntour short, the weather is so bad, and the police-traps have been so\nbad--nearly as bad as in Surrey. Ours is such a careful chauffeur, and\nmy husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like\nroad-hogs.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, naturally he--he isn t a road-hog.\"\n\n\"He was exceeding the speed-limit, I conclude. He must expect to suffer\nwith the lower animals.\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox was silenced. In growing discomfort they drove homewards.\nThe city seemed Satanic, the narrower streets oppressing like the\ngalleries of a mine.\n\nNo harm was done by the fog to trade, for it lay high, and the lighted\nwindows of the shops were thronged with customers. It was rather a\ndarkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself, to find a more\ngrievous darkness within. Margaret nearly spoke a dozen times, but\nsomething throttled her. She felt petty and awkward, and her meditations\non Christmas grew more cynical. Peace? It may bring other gifts, but is\nthere a single Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful? The craving for\nexcitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing. Goodwill? Had\nshe seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers? Or in herself?\nShe had failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a\nlittle queer and imaginative--she, whose birthright it was to nourish\nimagination! Better to have accepted, to have tired themselves a little\nby the journey, than coldly to reply, \"Might I come some other day?\" Her\ncynicism left her. There would be no other day. This shadowy woman would\nnever ask her again.\n\nThey parted at the Mansions. Mrs. Wilcox went in after due civilities,\nand Margaret watched the tall, lonely figure sweep up the hall to\nthe lift. As the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an\nimprisonment The beautiful head disappeared first, still buried in the\nmuff; the long trailing skirt followed. A woman of undefinable rarity\nwas going up heavenward, like a specimen in a bottle. And into what a\nheaven--a vault as of hell, sooty black, from which soot descended!\n\nAt lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence insisted on\ntalking. Tibby was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove\nhim to do the unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long\naccount of the day-school that he sometimes patronised. The account was\ninteresting, and she had often pressed him for it before, but she\ncould not attend now, for her mind was focussed on the invisible. She\ndiscerned that Mrs. Wilcox, though a loving wife and mother, had only\none passion in life--her house--and that the moment was solemn when she\ninvited a friend to share this passion with her. To answer \"another day\"\n was to answer as a fool. \"Another day\" will do for brick and mortar, but\nnot for the Holy of Holies into which Howards End had been transfigured.\nHer own curiosity was slight. She had heard more than enough about it in\nthe summer. The nine windows, the vine, and the wych-elm had no pleasant\nconnections for her, and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon\nat a concert. But imagination triumphed. While her brother held forth\nshe determined to go, at whatever cost, and to compel Mrs. Wilcox to go,\ntoo. When lunch was over she stepped over to the flats.\n\nMrs. Wilcox had just gone away for the night.\n\nMargaret said that it was of no consequence, hurried downstairs, and\ntook a hansom to King s Cross. She was convinced that the escapade\nwas important, though it would have puzzled her to say why. There was\nquestion of imprisonment and escape, and though she did not know the\ntime of the train, she strained her eyes for St. Pancras s clock.\n\nThen the clock of King s Cross swung into sight, a second moon in that\ninfernal sky, and her cab drew up at the station. There was a train for\nHilton in five minutes. She took a ticket, asking in her agitation for\na single. As she did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked\nher.\n\n\"I will come if I still may,\" said Margaret, laughing nervously.\n\n\"You are coming to sleep, dear, too. It is in the morning that my house\nis most beautiful. You are coming to stop. I cannot show you my meadow\nproperly except at sunrise. These fogs\"--she pointed at the station\nroof--\"never spread far. I dare say they are sitting in the sun in\nHertfordshire, and you will never repent joining them.\"\n\n\"I shall never repent joining you.\"\n\n\"It is the same.\"\n\nThey began the walk up the long platform. Far at its end stood the\ntrain, breasting the darkness without. They never reached it. Before\nimagination could triumph, there were cries of \"Mother! mother!\" and a\nheavy-browed girl darted out of the cloak-room and seized Mrs. Wilcox by\nthe arm.\n\n\"Evie!\" she gasped--\"Evie, my pet--\"\n\nThe girl called, \"Father! I say! look who s here.\"\n\n\"Evie, dearest girl, why aren t you in Yorkshire?\"\n\n\"No--motor smash--changed plans--father s coming.\"\n\n\"Why, Ruth!\" cried Mr. Wilcox, joining them, \"what in the name of all\nthat s wonderful are you doing here, Ruth?\"\n\nMrs. Wilcox had recovered herself.\n\n\"Oh, Henry dear!--here s a lovely surprise--but let me introduce--but I\nthink you know Miss Schlegel.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he replied, not greatly interested. \"But how s yourself,\nRuth?\"\n\n\"Fit as a fiddle,\" she answered gaily.\n\n\"So are we, and so was our car, which ran A1 as far as Ripon, but there\na wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver--\"\n\n\"Miss Schlegel, our little outing must be for another day.\"\n\n\"I was saying that this fool of a driver, as the policeman himself\nadmits.\"\n\n\"Another day, Mrs. Wilcox. Of course.\"\n\n\"--But as we ve insured against third party risks, it won t so much\nmatter--\"\n\n\"--Cart and car being practically at right angles--\"\n\nThe voices of the happy family rose high. Margaret was left alone.\nNo one wanted her. Mrs. Wilcox walked out of King s Cross between her\nhusband and her daughter, listening to both of them.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XI\n\nThe funeral was over. The carriages had rolled away through the soft\nmud, and only the poor remained. They approached to the newly-dug shaft\nand looked their last at the coffin, now almost hidden beneath the\nspadefuls of clay. It was their moment. Most of them were women from the\ndead woman s district, to whom black garments had been served out by Mr.\nWilcox s orders. Pure curiosity had brought others. They thrilled with\nthe excitement of a death, and of a rapid death, and stood in groups or\nmoved between the graves, like drops of ink. The son of one of them, a\nwood-cutter, was perched high above their heads, pollarding one of the\nchurchyard elms. From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton,\nstrung upon the North Road, with its accreting suburbs; the sunset\nbeyond, scarlet and orange, winking at him beneath brows of grey; the\nchurch; the plantations; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields\nand farms. But he, too, was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth.\nHe tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw\nthe coffin approaching: how he could not leave his work, and yet did not\nlike to go on with it; how he had almost slipped out of the tree, he was\nso upset; the rooks had cawed, and no wonder--it was as if rooks knew\ntoo. His mother claimed the prophetic power herself--she had seen\na strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time. London had done the\nmischief, said others. She had been a kind lady; her grandmother had\nbeen kind, too--a plainer person, but very kind. Ah, the old sort was\ndying out! Mr. Wilcox, he was a kind gentleman. They advanced to the\ntopic again and again, dully, but with exaltation. The funeral of a rich\nperson was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to the\neducated. It was Art; though remote from life, it enhanced life s\nvalues, and they witnessed it avidly.\n\nThe grave-diggers, who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval--they\ndisliked Charles; it was not a moment to speak of such things, but they\ndid not like Charles Wilcox--the grave-diggers finished their work and\npiled up the wreaths and crosses above it. The sun set over Hilton;\nthe grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were cleft with\none scarlet frown. Chattering sadly to each other, the mourners passed\nthrough the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down\nto the village. The young wood-cutter stayed a little longer, poised\nabove the silence and swaying rhythmically. At last the bough fell\nbeneath his saw. With a grunt, he descended, his thoughts dwelling no\nlonger on death, but on love, for he was mating. He stopped as he passed\nthe new grave; a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye.\n\"They didn t ought to have coloured flowers at buryings,\" he reflected.\nTrudging on a few steps, he stopped again, looked furtively at the dusk,\nturned back, wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf, and hid it in his\npocket.\n\nAfter him came silence absolute. The cottage that abutted on the\nchurchyard was empty, and no other house stood near. Hour after hour\nthe scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it. Clouds\ndrifted over it from the west; or the church may have been a ship,\nhigh-prowed, steering with all its company towards infinity. Towards\nmorning the air grew colder, the sky clearer, the surface of the earth\nhard and sparkling above the prostrate dead. The wood-cutter, returning\nafter a night of joy, reflected: \"They lilies, they chrysants; it s a\npity I didn t take them all.\"\n\nUp at Howards End they were attempting breakfast. Charles and Evie sat\nin the dining-room, with Mrs. Charles. Their father, who could not bear\nto see a face, breakfasted upstairs. He suffered acutely. Pain came over\nhim in spasms, as if it was physical, and even while he was about to\neat, his eyes would fill with tears, and he would lay down the morsel\nuntasted.\n\nHe remembered his wife s even goodness during thirty years. Not anything\nin detail--not courtship or early raptures--but just the unvarying\nvirtue, that seemed to him a woman s noblest quality. So many women are\ncapricious, breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity. Not so his\nwife. Year after year, summer and winter, as bride and mother, she had\nbeen the same, he had always trusted her. Her tenderness! Her innocence!\nThe wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of God. Ruth knew\nno more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her\ngarden, or the grass in her field. Her idea of business--\"Henry, why\ndo people who have enough money try to get more money?\" Her idea of\npolitics--\"I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet,\nthere would be no more wars,\" Her idea of religion--ah, this had been a\ncloud, but a cloud that passed. She came of Quaker stock, and he and his\nfamily, formerly Dissenters, were now members of the Church of England.\nThe rector s sermons had at first repelled her, and she had expressed a\ndesire for \"a more inward light,\" adding, \"not so much for myself as for\nbaby\" (Charles). Inward light must have been granted, for he heard no\ncomplaints in later years. They brought up their three children without\ndispute. They had never disputed.\n\nShe lay under the earth now. She had gone, and as if to make her going\nthe more bitter, had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike\nher. \"Why didn t you tell me you knew of it?\" he had moaned, and her\nfaint voice had answered: \"I didn t want to, Henry--I might have been\nwrong--and every one hates illnesses.\" He had been told of the horror by\na strange doctor, whom she had consulted during his absence from town.\nWas this altogether just? Without fully explaining, she had died. It\nwas a fault on her part, and--tears rushed into his eyes--what a little\nfault! It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years.\n\nHe rose to his feet and looked out of the window, for Evie had come in\nwith the letters, and he could meet no one s eye. Ah yes--she had been a\ngood woman--she had been steady. He chose the word deliberately. To him\nsteadiness included all praise. He himself, gazing at the wintry garden,\nis in appearance a steady man. His face was not as square as his son s,\nand, indeed, the chin, though firm enough in outline, retreated a\nlittle, and the lips, ambiguous, were curtained by a moustache. But\nthere was no external hint of weakness. The eyes, if capable of kindness\nand good-fellowship, if ruddy for the moment with tears, were the eyes\nof one who could not be driven. The forehead, too, was like Charles s.\nHigh and straight, brown and polished, merging abruptly into temples and\nskull, it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the\nworld. At times it had the effect of a blank wall. He had dwelt behind\nit, intact and happy, for fifty years. \"The post s come, father,\" said\nEvie awkwardly.\n\n\"Thanks. Put it down.\"\n\n\"Has the breakfast been all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, thanks.\"\n\nThe girl glanced at him and at it with constraint. She did not know what\nto do.\n\n\"Charles says do you want the Times?\"\n\n\"No, I ll read it later.\"\n\n\"Ring if you want anything, father, won t you?\"\n\n\"I ve all I want.\"\n\nHaving sorted the letters from the circulars, she went back to the\ndining-room.\n\n\"Father s eaten nothing,\" she announced, sitting down with wrinkled\nbrows behind the tea-urn.\n\nCharles did not answer, but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs,\nopened the door, and said \"Look here father, you must eat, you know;\"\n and having paused for a reply that did not come, stole down again. \"He s\ngoing to read his letters first, I think,\" he said evasively; \"I dare\nsay he will go on with his breakfast afterwards.\" Then he took up the\nTimes, and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup\nagainst saucer and of knife on plate.\n\nPoor Mrs. Charles sat between her silent companions terrified at\nthe course of events, and a little bored. She was a rubbishy little\ncreature, and she knew it. A telegram had dragged her from Naples to\nthe death-bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known. A word from her\nhusband had plunged her into mourning. She desired to mourn inwardly as\nwell, but she wished that Mrs. Wilcox, since fated to die, could have\ndied before the marriage, for then less would have been expected of her.\nCrumbling her toast, and too nervous to ask for the butter, she remained\nalmost motionless, thankful only for this, that her father-in-law was\nhaving his breakfast upstairs.\n\nAt last Charles spoke. \"They had no business to be pollarding those elms\nyesterday,\" he said to his sister.\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"I must make a note of that,\" he continued. \"I am surprised that the\nrector allowed it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it may not be the rector s affair.\"\n\n\"Whose else could it be?\"\n\n\"The lord of the manor.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Butter, Dolly?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Evie dear. Charles--\"\n\n\"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"I didn t know one could pollard elms. I thought one only pollarded\nwillows.\"\n\n\"Oh no, one can pollard elms.\"\n\n\"Then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?\" Charles\nfrowned a little, and turned again to his sister.\n\n\"Another point. I must speak to Chalkeley.\"\n\n\"Yes, rather; you must complain to Chalkeley.\"\n\n\"It s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men. He is\nresponsible.\"\n\n\"Yes, rather.\"\n\nBrother and sister were not callous. They spoke thus, partly because\nthey desired to keep Chalkeley up to the mark--a healthy desire in its\nway--partly because they avoided the personal note in life. All Wilcoxes\ndid. It did not seem to them of supreme importance. Or it may be as\nHelen supposed: they realised its importance, but were afraid of it.\nPanic and emptiness, could one glance behind. They were not callous, and\nthey left the breakfast-table with aching hearts. Their mother never had\ncome in to breakfast. It was in the other rooms, and especially in the\ngarden, that they felt her loss most. As Charles went out to the garage,\nhe was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom\nhe could never replace. What battles he had fought against her gentle\nconservatism! How she had disliked improvements, yet how loyally she had\naccepted them when made! He and his father--what trouble they had had\nto get this very garage! With what difficulty had they persuaded her to\nyield them the paddock for it--the paddock that she loved more dearly\nthan the garden itself! The vine--she had got her way about the vine. It\nstill encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches. And so\nwith Evie, as she stood talking to the cook. Though she could take up\nher mother s work inside the house, just as the man could take it up\nwithout, she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life.\nTheir grief, though less poignant than their father s, grew from deeper\nroots, for a wife may be replaced; a mother never. Charles would go\nback to the office. There was little at Howards End. The contents of his\nmother s will had long been known to them. There were no legacies, no\nannuities, none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead\nprolong their activities. Trusting her husband, she had left him\neverything without reserve. She was quite a poor woman--the house had\nbeen all her dowry, and the house would come to Charles in time. Her\nwatercolours Mr. Wilcox intended to reserve for Paul, while Evie would\ntake the jewellery and lace. How easily she slipped out of life!\nCharles thought the habit laudable, though he did not intend to adopt\nit himself, whereas Margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable\nindifference to earthly fame. Cynicism--not the superficial cynicism\nthat snarls and sneers, but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and\ntenderness--that was the note of Mrs. Wilcox s will. She wanted not to\nvex people. That accomplished, the earth might freeze over her for ever.\n\nNo, there was nothing for Charles to wait for. He could not go on\nwith his honeymoon, so he would go up to London and work--he felt too\nmiserable hanging about. He and Dolly would have the furnished flat\nwhile his father rested quietly in the country with Evie. He could\nalso keep an eye on his own little house, which was being painted and\ndecorated for him in one of the Surrey suburbs, and in which he hoped to\ninstall himself soon after Christmas. Yes, he would go up after lunch in\nhis new motor, and the town servants, who had come down for the funeral,\nwould go up by train.\n\nHe found his father s chauffeur in the garage, said \"Morning\" without\nlooking at the man s face, and bending over the car, continued: \"Hullo!\nmy new car s been driven!\"\n\n\"Has it, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Charles, getting rather red; \"and whoever s driven it hasn t\ncleaned it properly, for there s mud on the axle. Take it off.\"\n\nThe man went for the cloths without a word. He was a chauffeur as ugly\nas sin--not that this did him disservice with Charles, who thought charm\nin a man rather rot, and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast\nwith whom they had started.\n\n\"Charles--\" His bride was tripping after him over the hoar-frost, a\ndainty black column, her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming\nthe capital thereof.\n\n\"One minute, I m busy. Well, Crane, who s been driving it, do you\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Don t know, I m sure, sir. No one s driven it since I ve been back,\nbut, of course, there s the fortnight I ve been away with the other car\nin Yorkshire.\"\n\nThe mud came off easily.\n\n\"Charles, your father s down. Something s happened. He wants you in the\nhouse at once. Oh, Charles!\"\n\n\"Wait, dear, wait a minute. Who had the key of the garage while you were\naway, Crane?\"\n\n\"The gardener, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor?\"\n\n\"No, sir; no one s had the motor out, sir.\"\n\n\"Then how do you account for the mud on the axle?\"\n\n\"I can t, of course, say for the time I ve been in Yorkshire. No more\nmud now, sir.\"\n\nCharles was vexed. The man was treating him as a fool, and if his heart\nhad not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father. But it\nwas not a morning for complaints. Ordering the motor to be round after\nlunch, he joined his wife, who had all the while been pouring out some\nincoherent story about a letter and a Miss Schlegel.\n\n\"Now, Dolly, I can attend to you. Miss Schlegel? What does she want?\"\n\nWhen people wrote a letter Charles always asked what they wanted. Want\nwas to him the only cause of action. And the question in this case was\ncorrect, for his wife replied, \"She wants Howards End.\"\n\n\"Howards End? Now, Crane, just don t forget to put on the Stepney\nwheel.\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, mind you don t forget, for I--Come, little woman.\" When they were\nout of the chauffeur s sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed\nher against him. All his affection and half his attention--it was what\nhe granted her throughout their happy married life.\n\n\"But you haven t listened, Charles.\"\n\n\"What s wrong?\"\n\n\"I keep on telling you--Howards End. Miss Schlegel s got it.\"\n\n\"Got what?\" said Charles, unclasping her. \"What the dickens are you\ntalking about?\"\n\n\"Now, Charles, you promised not to say those naughty--\"\n\n\"Look here, I m in no mood for foolery. It s no morning for it either.\"\n\n\"I tell you--I keep on telling you--Miss Schlegel--she s got it--your\nmother s left it to her--and you ve all got to move out!\"\n\n\"HOWARDS END?\"\n\n\"HOWARDS END!\" she screamed, mimicking him, and as she did so Evie came\ndashing out of the shubbery.\n\n\"Dolly, go back at once! My father s much annoyed with you.\nCharles\"--she hit herself wildly--\"come in at once to father. He s had a\nletter that s too awful.\"\n\nCharles began to run, but checked himself, and stepped heavily across\nthe gravel path. There the house was with the nine windows, the\nunprolific vine. He exclaimed, \"Schlegels again!\" and as if to complete\nchaos, Dolly said, \"Oh no, the matron of the nursing home has written\ninstead of her.\"\n\n\"Come in, all three of you!\" cried his father, no longer inert.\n\n\"Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wilcox--\"\n\n\"I told you not to go out to the garage. I ve heard you all shouting in\nthe garden. I won t have it. Come in.\"\n\nHe stood in the porch, transformed, letters in his hand.\n\n\"Into the dining-room, every one of you. We can t discuss private\nmatters in the middle of all the servants. Here, Charles, here; read\nthese. See what you make.\"\n\nCharles took two letters, and read them as he followed the procession.\nThe first was a covering note from the matron. Mrs. Wilcox had desired\nher, when the funeral should be over, to forward the enclosed. The\nenclosed--it was from his mother herself. She had written: \"To my\nhusband: I should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards End.\"\n\n\"I suppose we re going to have a talk about this?\" he remarked,\nominously calm.\n\n\"Certainly. I was coming out to you when Dolly--\"\n\n\"Well, let s sit down.\"\n\n\"Come, Evie, don t waste time, sit--down.\"\n\nIn silence they drew up to the breakfast-table. The events of\nyesterday--indeed, of this morning suddenly receded into a past so\nremote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it. Heavy breathings\nwere heard. They were calming themselves. Charles, to steady\nthem further, read the enclosure out loud: \"A note in my mother s\nhandwriting, in an envelope addressed to my father, sealed. Inside:  I\nshould like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards End.  No date, no\nsignature. Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home. Now, the\nquestion is--\"\n\nDolly interrupted him. \"But I say that note isn t legal. Houses ought to\nbe done by a lawyer, Charles, surely.\"\n\nHer husband worked his jaw severely. Little lumps appeared in front of\neither ear--a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect, and she\nasked whether she might see the note. Charles looked at his father for\npermission, who said abstractedly, \"Give it her.\" She seized it, and\nat once exclaimed: \"Why, it s only in pencil! I said so. Pencil never\ncounts.\"\n\n\"We know that it is not legally binding, Dolly,\" said Mr. Wilcox,\nspeaking from out of his fortress. \"We are aware of that. Legally, I\nshould be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire. Of\ncourse, my dear, we consider you as one of the family, but it will be\nbetter if you do not interfere with what you do not understand.\"\n\nCharles, vexed both with his father and his wife, then repeated: \"The\nquestion is--\" He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from plates\nand knives, so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth. \"The\nquestion is whether Miss Schlegel, during the fortnight we were all\naway, whether she unduly--\" He stopped.\n\n\"I don t think that,\" said his father, whose nature was nobler than his\nson s.\n\n\"Don t think what?\"\n\n\"That she would have--that it is a case of undue influence. No, to\nmy mind the question is the--the invalid s condition at the time she\nwrote.\"\n\n\"My dear father, consult an expert if you like, but I don t admit it is\nmy mother s writing.\"\n\n\"Why, you just said it was!\" cried Dolly.\n\n\"Never mind if I did,\" he blazed out; \"and hold your tongue.\"\n\nThe poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her handkerchief\nfrom her pocket, shed a few tears. No one noticed her. Evie was scowling\nlike an angry boy. The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the\ncommittee-room. They were both at their best when serving on committees.\nThey did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk, but\ndisposed of them item by item, sharply. Caligraphy was the item before\nthem now, and on it they turned their well-trained brains. Charles,\nafter a little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and they passed\non to the next point. It is the best--perhaps the only--way of dodging\nemotion. They were the average human article, and had they considered\nthe note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad.\nConsidered item by item, the emotional content was minimised, and all\nwent forward smoothly. The clock ticked, the coals blazed higher, and\ncontended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows.\nUnnoticed, the sun occupied his sky, and the shadows of the tree stems,\nextraordinarily solid, fell like trenches of purple across the frosted\nlawn. It was a glorious winter morning. Evie s fox terrier, who had\npassed for white, was only a dirty grey dog now, so intense was the\npurity that surrounded him. He was discredited, but the blackbirds that\nhe was chasing glowed with Arabian darkness, for all the conventional\ncolouring of life had been altered. Inside, the clock struck ten with a\nrich and confident note. Other clocks confirmed it, and the discussion\nmoved towards its close.\n\nTo follow it is unnecessary. It is rather a moment when the commentator\nshould step forward. Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to\nMargaret? I think not. The appeal was too flimsy. It was not legal; it\nhad been written in illness, and under the spell of a sudden friendship;\nit was contrary to the dead woman s intentions in the past, contrary to\nher very nature, so far as that nature was understood by them. To them\nHowards End was a house: they could not know that to her it had been\na spirit, for which she sought a spiritual heir. And--pushing one step\nfarther in these mists--may they not have decided even better than\nthey supposed? Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be\nbequeathed at all? Has the soul offspring? A wych-elm tree, a vine, a\nwisp of hay with dew on it--can passion for such things be transmitted\nwhere there is no bond of blood? No; the Wilcoxes are not to be blamed.\nThe problem is too terrific, and they could not even perceive a problem.\nNo; it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear\nthe note up and throw it on to their dining-room fire. The practical\nmoralist may acquit them absolutely. He who strives to look deeper\nmay acquit them--almost. For one hard fact remains. They did neglect a\npersonal appeal. The woman who had died did say to them, \"Do this,\" and\nthey answered, \"We will not.\"\n\nThe incident made a most painful impression on them. Grief mounted into\nthe brain and worked there disquietingly. Yesterday they had lamented:\n\"She was a dear mother, a true wife; in our absence she neglected her\nhealth and died.\" To-day they thought: \"She was not as true, as dear, as\nwe supposed.\" The desire for a more inward light had found expression at\nlast, the unseen had impacted on the seen, and all that they could say\nwas \"Treachery.\" Mrs. Wilcox had been treacherous to the family, to the\nlaws of property, to her own written word. How did she expect Howards\nEnd to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel? Was her husband, to whom it legally\nbelonged, to make it over to her as a free gift? Was the said Miss\nSchlegel to have a life interest in it, or to own it absolutely? Was\nthere to be no compensation for the garage and other improvements that\nthey had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some\nday? Treacherous! treacherous and absurd! When we think the dead both\ntreacherous and absurd, we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves\nto their departure. That note, scribbled in pencil, sent through the\nmatron, was unbusinesslike as well as cruel, and decreased at once the\nvalue of the woman who had written it.\n\n\"Ah, well!\" said Mr. Wilcox, rising from the table. \"I shouldn t have\nthought it possible.\"\n\n\"Mother couldn t have meant it,\" said Evie, still frowning.\n\n\"No, my girl, of course not.\"\n\n\"Mother believed so in ancestors too--it isn t like her to leave\nanything to an outsider, who d never appreciate.\"\n\n\"The whole thing is unlike her,\" he announced. \"If Miss Schlegel had\nbeen poor, if she had wanted a house, I could understand it a little.\nBut she has a house of her own. Why should she want another? She\nwouldn t have any use for Howards End.\"\n\n\"That time may prove,\" murmured Charles.\n\n\"How?\" asked his sister.\n\n\"Presumably she knows--mother will have told her. She got twice or three\ntimes into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments.\"\n\n\"What a horrid woman!\" And Dolly, who had recovered, cried, \"Why, she\nmay be coming down to turn us out now!\"\n\nCharles put her right. \"I wish she would,\" he said ominously. \"I could\nthen deal with her.\"\n\n\"So could I,\" echoed his father, who was feeling rather in the cold.\nCharles had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in\ntelling him to eat his breakfast, but the boy as he grew up was a little\ndictatorial, and assumed the post of chairman too readily. \"I could deal\nwith her, if she comes, but she won t come. You re all a bit hard on\nMiss Schlegel.\"\n\n\"That Paul business was pretty scandalous, though.\"\n\n\"I want no more of the Paul business, Charles, as I said at the time,\nand besides, it is quite apart from this business. Margaret Schlegel has\nbeen officious and tiresome during this terrible week, and we have\nall suffered under her, but upon my soul she s honest. She s NOT in\ncollusion with the matron. I m absolutely certain of it. Nor was she\nwith the doctor, I m equally certain of that. She did not hide anything\nfrom us, for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are.\nShe, like ourselves, was a dupe--\" He stopped for a moment. \"You see,\nCharles, in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions.\nPaul would not have left England, you would not have gone to Italy, nor\nEvie and I into Yorkshire, if only we had known. Well, Miss Schlegel s\nposition has been equally false. Take all in all, she has not come out\nof it badly.\"\n\nEvie said: \"But those chrysanthemums--\"\n\n\"Or coming down to the funeral at all--\" echoed Dolly.\n\n\"Why shouldn t she come down? She had the right to, and she stood far\nback among the Hilton women. The flowers--certainly we should not have\nsent such flowers, but they may have seemed the right thing to her,\nEvie, and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany.\"\n\n\"Oh, I forget she isn t really English,\" cried Evie. \"That would explain\na lot.\"\n\n\"She s a cosmopolitan,\" said Charles, looking at his watch. \"I admit I m\nrather down on cosmopolitans. My fault, doubtless. I cannot stand them,\nand a German cosmopolitan is the limit. I think that s about all, isn t\nit? I want to run down and see Chalkeley. A bicycle will do. And, by the\nway, I wish you d speak to Crane some time. I m certain he s had my new\ncar out.\"\n\n\"Has he done it any harm?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In that case I shall let it pass. It s not worth while having a row.\"\n\nCharles and his father sometimes disagreed. But they always parted\nwith an increased regard for one another, and each desired no doughtier\ncomrade when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions.\nSo the sailors of Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens, having first stopped\none another s ears with wool.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XII\n\nCharles need not have been anxious. Miss Schlegel had never heard of his\nmother s strange request. She was to hear of it in after years, when she\nhad built up her life differently, and it was to fit into position as\nthe headstone of the corner. Her mind was bent on other questions\nnow, and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an\ninvalid.\n\nShe was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second time. Paul and his\nmother, ripple and great wave, had flowed into her life and ebbed out of\nit for ever. The ripple had left no traces behind; the wave had strewn\nat her feet fragments torn from the unknown. A curious seeker, she stood\nfor a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little, but tells\na little, and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide. Her\nfriend had vanished in agony, but not, she believed, in degradation.\nHer withdrawal had hinted at other things besides disease and pain. Some\nleave our life with tears, others with an insane frigidity; Mrs. Wilcox\nhad taken the middle course, which only rarer natures can pursue. She\nhad kept proportion. She had told a little of her grim secret to her\nfriends, but not too much; she had shut up her heart--almost, but\nnot entirely. It is thus, if there is any rule, that we ought to\ndie--neither as victim nor as fanatic, but as the seafarer who can greet\nwith an equal eye the deep that he is entering, and the shore that he\nmust leave.\n\nThe last word--whatever it would be--had certainly not been said in\nHilton churchyard. She had not died there. A funeral is not death, any\nmore than baptism is birth or marriage union. All three are the clumsy\ndevices, coming now too late, now too early, by which Society would\nregister the quick motions of man. In Margaret s eyes Mrs. Wilcox had\nescaped registration. She had gone out of life vividly, her own way, and\nno dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin, lowered\nwith ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth, no flowers so\nutterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered\nbefore morning. Margaret had once said she \"loved superstition.\" It was\nnot true. Few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in\nwhich body and soul are enwrapped. The death of Mrs. Wilcox had helped\nher in her work. She saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a\nhuman being is, and to what he may aspire. Truer relationships gleamed.\nPerhaps the last word would be hope--hope even on this side of the\ngrave.\n\nMeanwhile, she could take an interest in the survivors. In spite of her\nChristmas duties, in spite of her brother, the Wilcoxes continued to\nplay a considerable part in her thoughts. She had seen so much of them\nin the final week. They were not \"her sort,\" they were often suspicious\nand stupid, and deficient where she excelled; but collision with them\nstimulated her, and she felt an interest that verged into liking, even\nfor Charles. She desired to protect them, and often felt that they could\nprotect her, excelling where she was deficient. Once past the rocks of\nemotion, they knew so well what to do, whom to send for; their hands\nwere on all the ropes, they had grit as well as grittiness and she\nvalued grit enormously. They led a life that she could not attain\nto--the outer life of \"telegrams and anger,\" which had detonated when\nHelen and Paul had touched in June, and had detonated again the other\nweek. To Margaret this life was to remain a real force. She could not\ndespise it, as Helen and Tibby affected to do. It fostered such virtues\nas neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no\ndoubt, but they have formed our civilisation. They form character, too;\nMargaret could not doubt it; they keep the soul from becoming sloppy.\nHow dare Schlegels despise Wilcoxes, when it takes all sorts to make a\nworld?\n\n\"Don t brood too much,\" she wrote to Helen, \"on the superiority of\nthe unseen to the seen. It s true, but to brood on it is medieval. Our\nbusiness is not to contrast the two, but to reconcile them.\"\n\nHelen replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull\nsubject. What did her sister take her for? The weather was magnificent.\nShe and the Mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that\nPomerania boasted. It was fun, but over-crowded, for the rest of\nPomerania had gone there too. Helen loved the country, and her letter\nglowed with physical exercise and poetry. She spoke of the scenery,\nquiet, yet august; of the snow-clad fields, with their scampering herds\nof deer; of the river and its quaint entrance into the Baltic Sea; of\nthe Oderberge, only three hundred feet high, from which one slid all too\nquickly back into the Pomeranian plains, and yet these Oderberge were\nreal mountains, with pine-forests, streams, and views complete. \"It\nisn t size that counts so much as the way things are arranged.\" In\nanother paragraph she referred to Mrs. Wilcox sympathetically, but the\nnews had not bitten into her. She had not realised the accessories\nof death, which are in a sense more memorable than death itself. The\natmosphere of precautions and recriminations, and in the midst a human\nbody growing more vivid because it was in pain; the end of that body in\nHilton churchyard; the survival of something that suggested hope, vivid\nin its turn against life s workaday cheerfulness;--all these were lost\nto Helen, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be pleasant no\nlonger. She returned to Wickham Place full of her own affairs--she had\nhad another proposal--and Margaret, after a moment s hesitation, was\ncontent that this should be so.\n\nThe proposal had not been a serious matter. It was the work of Fraulein\nMosebach, who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning\nback her cousins to the Fatherland by matrimony. England had played Paul\nWilcox, and lost; Germany played Herr Forstmeister some one--Helen could\nnot remember his name. Herr Forstmeister lived in a wood, and, standing\non the summit of the Oderberge, he had pointed out his house to Helen,\nor rather, had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay. She had\nexclaimed, \"Oh, how lovely! That s the place for me!\" and in the evening\nFrieda appeared in her bedroom. \"I have a message, dear Helen,\" etc.,\nand so she had, but had been very nice when Helen laughed; quite\nunderstood--a forest too solitary and damp--quite agreed, but Herr\nForstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary. Germany had\nlost, but with good-humour; holding the manhood of the world, she felt\nbound to win. \"And there will even be some one for Tibby,\" concluded\nHelen. \"There now, Tibby, think of that; Frieda is saving up a little\ngirl for you, in pig-tails and white worsted stockings but the feet\nof the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in\nstrawberries. I ve talked too much. My head aches. Now you talk.\"\n\nTibby consented to talk. He too was full of his own affairs, for he had\njust been up to try for a scholarship at Oxford. The men were down, and\nthe candidates had been housed in various colleges, and had dined in\nhall. Tibby was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he\ngave a description of his visit that was almost glowing. The august and\nmellow University, soaked with the richness of the western counties that\nit has served for a thousand years, appealed at once to the boy s taste;\nit was the kind of thing he could understand, and he understood it\nall the better because it was empty. Oxford is--Oxford; not a mere\nreceptacle for youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its inmates to\nlove it rather than to love one another; such at all events was to\nbe its effect on Tibby. His sisters sent him there that he might make\nfriends, for they knew that his education had been cranky, and had\nsevered him from other boys and men. He made no friends. His Oxford\nremained Oxford empty, and he took into life with him, not the memory of\na radiance, but the memory of a colour scheme.\n\nIt pleased Margaret to hear her brother and sister talking. They did\nnot get on overwell as a rule. For a few moments she listened to them,\nfeeling elderly and benign.\n\nThen something occurred to her, and she interrupted.\n\n\"Helen, I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox; that sad business?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have had a correspondence with her son. He was winding up the estate,\nand wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything.\nI thought it good of him, considering I knew her so little. I said that\nshe had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present, but we both forgot\nabout it afterwards.\"\n\n\"I hope Charles took the hint.\"\n\n\"Yes--that is to say, her husband wrote later on, and thanked me for\nbeing a little kind to her, and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette.\nDon t you think that is extraordinarily generous? It has made me\nlike him very much. He hopes that this will not be the end of our\nacquaintance, but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in\nthe future. I like Mr. Wilcox. He is taking up his work--rubber--it is\na big business. I gather he is launching out rather. Charles is in it,\ntoo. Charles is married--a pretty little creature, but she doesn t seem\nwise. They took on the flat, but now they have gone off to a house of\ntheir own.\"\n\nHelen, after a decent pause, continued her account of Stettin. How\nquickly a situation changes! In June she had been in a crisis; even in\nNovember she could blush and be unnatural; now it was January and\nthe whole affair lay forgotten. Looking back on the past six months,\nMargaret realised the chaotic nature of our daily life, and its\ndifference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by\nhistorians. Actual life is full of false clues and sign-posts that lead\nnowhere. With infinite effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never\ncomes. The most successful career must show a waste of strength that\nmight have removed mountains, and the most unsuccessful is not that\nof the man who is taken unprepared, but of him who has prepared and is\nnever taken. On a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly\nsilent. It assumes that preparation against danger is in itself a good,\nand that men, like nations, are the better for staggering through life\nfully armed. The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save\nby the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality\nwould have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of\nit is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its\nessence is romantic beauty. Margaret hoped that for the future she would\nbe less cautious, not more cautious, than she had been in the past.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIII\n\nOver two years passed, and the Schlegel household continued to lead its\nlife of cultured, but not ignoble, ease, still swimming gracefully on\nthe grey tides of London. Concerts and plays swept past them, money had\nbeen spent and renewed, reputations won and lost, and the city herself,\nemblematic of their lives, rose and fell in a continual flux, while her\nshallows washed more widely against the hills of Surrey and over the\nfields of Hertfordshire. This famous building had arisen, that was\ndoomed. To-day Whitehall had been transformed; it would be the turn\nof Regent Street to-morrow. And month by month the roads smelt more\nstrongly of petrol, and were more difficult to cross, and human beings\nheard each other speak with greater difficulty, breathed less of the\nair, and saw less of the sky. Nature withdrew; the leaves were falling\nby midsummer; the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity.\n\nTo speak against London is no longer fashionable. The Earth as an\nartistic cult has had its day, and the literature of the near future\nwill probably ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town. One\ncan understand the reaction. Of Pan and the elemental forces, the public\nhas heard a little too much--they seem Victorian, while London is\nGeorgian--and those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long\nere the pendulum swings back to her again. Certainly London fascinates.\nOne visualises it as a tract of quivering grey, intelligent without\npurpose, and excitable without love; as a spirit that has altered before\nit can be chronicled; as a heart that certainly beats, but with no\npulsation of humanity. It lies beyond everything; Nature, with all\nher cruelty, comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men. A friend\nexplains himself; the earth is explicable--from her we came, and we must\nreturn to her. But who can explain Westminster Bridge Road or Liverpool\nStreet in the morning--the city inhaling--or the same thoroughfares\nin the evening--the city exhaling her exhausted air? We reach in\ndesperation beyond the fog, beyond the very stars, the voids of the\nuniverse are ransacked to justify the monster, and stamped with a human\nface. London is religion s opportunity--not the decorous religion of\ntheologians, but anthropomorphic, crude. Yes, the continuous flow\nwould be tolerable if a man of our own sort--not any one pompous or\ntearful--were caring for us up in the sky.\n\nThe Londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him, too, away\nfrom his moorings, and Margaret s eyes were not opened until the lease\nof Wickham Place expired. She had always known that it must expire, but\nthe knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event.\nThen the house was suddenly ringed with pathos. It had seen so much\nhappiness. Why had it to be swept away? In the streets of the city\nshe noted for the first time the architecture of hurry and heard the\nlanguage of hurry on the mouths of its inhabitants--clipped words,\nformless sentences, potted expressions of approval or disgust. Month by\nmonth things were stepping livelier, but to what goal? The population\nstill rose, but what was the quality of the men born? The particular\nmillionaire who owned the freehold of Wickham Place, and desired to\nerect Babylonian flats upon it--what right had he to stir so large a\nportion of the quivering jelly? He was not a fool--she had heard him\nexpose Socialism--but true insight began just where his intelligence\nended, and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires.\nWhat right had such men--But Margaret checked herself. That way lies\nmadness. Thank goodness, she, too, had some money, and could purchase a\nnew home.\n\nTibby, now in his second year at Oxford, was down for the Easter\nvacation, and Margaret took the opportunity of having a serious talk\nwith him. Did he at all know where he wanted to live? Tibby didn t\nknow that he did know. Did he at all know what he wanted to do? He was\nequally uncertain, but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to\nbe quite free of any profession. Margaret was not shocked, but went on\nsewing for a few minutes before she replied:\n\n\"I was thinking of Mr. Vyse. He never strikes me as particularly happy.\"\n\n\"Ye--es.\" said Tibby, and then held his mouth open in a curious quiver,\nas if he, too, had thought of Mr. Vyse, had seen round, through, over,\nand beyond Mr. Vyse, had weighed Mr. Vyse, grouped him, and finally\ndismissed him as having no possible bearing on the Subject under\ndiscussion. That bleat of Tibby s infuriated Helen. But Helen was now\ndown in the dining room preparing a speech about political economy. At\ntimes her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor.\n\n\"But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched, weedy man, don t you think? Then\nthere s Guy. That was a pitiful business. Besides\"--shifting to the\ngeneral--\"every one is the better for some regular work.\"\n\nGroans.\n\n\"I shall stick to it,\" she continued, smiling. \"I am not saying it\nto educate you; it is what I really think. I believe that in the last\ncentury men have developed the desire for work, and they must not starve\nit. It s a new desire. It goes with a great deal that s bad, but in\nitself it s good, and I hope that for women, too,  not to work  will\nsoon become as shocking as  not to be married  was a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude,\"\n enunciated Tibby.\n\n\"Then we ll leave the subject till you do. I m not going to rattle you\nround. Take your time. Only do think over the lives of the men you like\nmost, and see how they ve arranged them.\"\n\n\"I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most,\" said Tibby faintly, and leant so far\nback in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to\nthroat.\n\n\"And don t think I m not serious because I don t use the traditional\narguments--making money, a sphere awaiting you, and so on--all of which\nare, for various reasons, cant.\" She sewed on. \"I m only your sister.\nI haven t any authority over you, and I don t want to have any. Just\nto put before you what I think the Truth. You see\"--she shook off the\npince-nez to which she had recently taken--\"in a few years we shall be\nthe same age practically, and I shall want you to help me. Men are so\nmuch nicer than women.\"\n\n\"Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry?\"\n\n\"I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance.\"\n\n\"Has nobody arst you?\"\n\n\"Only ninnies.\"\n\n\"Do people ask Helen?\"\n\n\"Plentifully.\"\n\n\"Tell me about them.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Tell me about your ninnies, then.\"\n\n\"They were men who had nothing better to do,\" said his sister, feeling\nthat she was entitled to score this point. \"So take warning; you must\nwork, or else you must pretend to work, which is what I do. Work, work,\nwork if you d save your soul and your body. It is honestly a necessity,\ndear boy. Look at the Wilcoxes, look at Mr. Pembroke. With all their\ndefects of temper and understanding, such men give me more pleasure than\nmany who are better equipped, and I think it is because they have worked\nregularly and honestly.\"\n\n\"Spare me the Wilcoxes,\" he moaned.\n\n\"I shall not. They are the right sort.\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness me, Meg--!\" he protested, suddenly sitting up, alert and\nangry. Tibby, for all his defects, had a genuine personality.\n\n\"Well, they re as near the right sort as you can imagine.\"\n\n\"No, no--oh, no!\"\n\n\"I was thinking of the younger son, whom I once classed as a ninny,\nbut who came back so ill from Nigeria. He s gone out there again, Evie\nWilcox tells me--out to his duty.\"\n\n\"Duty\" always elicited a groan.\n\n\"He doesn t want the money, it is work he wants, though it is beastly\nwork--dull country, dishonest natives, an eternal fidget over fresh\nwater and food... A nation that can produce men of that sort may well be\nproud. No wonder England has become an Empire.\"\n\n\"EMPIRE!\"\n\n\"I can t bother over results,\" said Margaret, a little sadly. \"They are\ntoo difficult for me. I can only look at the men. An Empire bores me,\nso far, but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up. London\nbores me, but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make\nLondon--\"\n\n\"What it is,\" he sneered.\n\n\"What it is, worse luck. I want activity without civilisation. How\nparadoxical! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Tibby, \"want civilisation without activity, which, I\nexpect, is what we shall find in the other place.\"\n\n\"You needn t go as far as the other place, Tibbikins, if you want that.\nYou can find it at Oxford.\"\n\n\"Stupid--\"\n\n\"If I m stupid, get me back to the house-hunting. I ll even live in\nOxford if you like--North Oxford. I ll live anywhere except Bournemouth,\nTorquay, and Cheltenham. Oh yes, or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge\nWells and Surbiton and Bedford. There on no account.\"\n\n\"London, then.\"\n\n\"I agree, but Helen rather wants to get away from London. However,\nthere s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a\nflat in town, provided we all stick together and contribute. Though of\ncourse--Oh, how one does maunder on and to think, to think of the people\nwho are really poor. How do they live? Not to move about the world would\nkill me.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the door was flung open, and Helen burst in in a state of\nextreme excitement.\n\n\"Oh, my dears, what do you think? You ll never guess. A woman s been\nhere asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?\" (Helen was fond of supplying\nher own surprise.) \"Yes, for her husband, and it really is so.\"\n\n\"Not anything to do with Bracknell?\" cried Margaret, who had lately\ntaken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots.\n\n\"I offered Bracknell, and he was rejected. So was Tibby. (Cheer up,\nTibby!) It s no one we know. I said,  Hunt, my good woman; have a good\nlook round, hunt under the tables, poke up the chimney, shake out the\nantimacassars. Husband? husband?  Oh, and she so magnificently dressed\nand tinkling like a chandelier.\"\n\n\"Now, Helen, what did really happen?\"\n\n\"What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech. Annie opens the door\nlike a fool, and shows a female straight in on me, with my mouth open.\nThen we began--very civilly.  I want my husband, what I have reason to\nbelieve is here.  No--how unjust one is. She said  whom,  not  what. \nShe got it perfectly. So I said,  Name, please?  and she said,  Lan,\nMiss,  and there we were.\"\n\n\"Lan?\"\n\n\"Lan or Len. We were not nice about our vowels. Lanoline.\"\n\n\"But what an extraordinary--\"\n\n\"I said,  My good Mrs. Lanoline, we have some grave misunderstanding\nhere. Beautiful as I am, my modesty is even more remarkable than my\nbeauty, and never, never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine. \"\n\n\"I hope you were pleased,\" said Tibby.\n\n\"Of course,\" Helen squeaked. \"A perfectly delightful experience.\nOh, Mrs. Lanoline s a dear--she asked for a husband as if he were\nan umbrella. She mislaid him Saturday afternoon--and for a long time\nsuffered no inconvenience. But all night, and all this morning her\napprehensions grew. Breakfast didn t seem the same--no, no more did\nlunch, and so she strolled up to 2 Wickham Place as being the most\nlikely place for the missing article.\"\n\n\"But how on earth--\"\n\n\"Don t begin how on earthing.  I know what I know,  she kept repeating,\nnot uncivilly, but with extreme gloom. In vain I asked her what she did\nknow. Some knew what others knew, and others didn t, and then others\nagain had better be careful. Oh dear, she was incompetent! She had\na face like a silkworm, and the dining-room reeks of orris-root. We\nchatted pleasantly a little about husbands, and I wondered where hers\nwas too, and advised her to go to the police. She thanked me. We agreed\nthat Mr. Lanoline s a notty, notty man, and hasn t no business to go\non the lardy-da. But I think she suspected me up to the last. Bags I\nwriting to Aunt Juley about this. Now, Meg, remember--bags I.\"\n\n\"Bag it by all means,\" murmured Margaret, putting down her work. \"I m\nnot sure that this is so funny, Helen. It means some horrible volcano\nsmoking somewhere, doesn t it?\"\n\n\"I don t think so--she doesn t really mind. The admirable creature isn t\ncapable of tragedy.\"\n\n\"Her husband may be, though,\" said Margaret, moving to the window.\n\n\"Oh no, not likely. No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs.\nLanoline.\"\n\n\"Was she pretty?\"\n\n\"Her figure may have been good once.\"\n\nThe flats, their only outlook, hung like an ornate curtain between\nMargaret and the welter of London. Her thoughts turned sadly\nto house-hunting. Wickham Place had been so safe. She feared,\nfantastically, that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil\nand squalor, into nearer contact with such episodes as these.\n\n\"Tibby and I have again been wondering where we ll live next September,\"\n she said at last.\n\n\"Tibby had better first wonder what he ll do,\" retorted Helen; and that\ntopic was resumed, but with acrimony. Then tea came, and after tea Helen\nwent on preparing her speech, and Margaret prepared one, too, for they\nwere going out to a discussion society on the morrow. But her thoughts\nwere poisoned. Mrs. Lanoline had risen out of the abyss, like a faint\nsmell, a goblin football, telling of a life where love and hatred had\nboth decayed.\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIV\n\nThe mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained. Next day, just as\nthey were dressed to go out to dinner, a Mr. Bast called. He was a clerk\nin the employment of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. Thus much\nfrom his card. He had come \"about the lady yesterday.\" Thus much from\nAnnie, who had shown him into the dining-room.\n\n\"Cheers, children!\" cried Helen. \"It s Mrs. Lanoline.\"\n\nTibby was interested. The three hurried downstairs, to find, not the\ngay dog they expected, but a young man, colourless, toneless, who had\nalready the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so\ncommon in London, and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing\npresences. One guessed him as the third generation, grandson to the\nshepherd or ploughboy whom civilisation had sucked into the town; as one\nof the thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach\nthe life of the spirit. Hints of robustness survived in him, more than a\nhint of primitive good looks, and Margaret, noting the spine that might\nhave been straight, and the chest that might have broadened, wondered\nwhether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a\ncouple of ideas. Culture had worked in her own case, but during the last\nfew weeks she had doubted whether it humanised the majority, so wide\nand so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the\nphilosophic man, so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to\ncross it. She knew this type very well--the vague aspirations, the\nmental dishonesty, the familiarity with the outsides of books. She knew\nthe very tones in which he would address her. She was only unprepared\nfor an example of her own visiting-card.\n\n\"You wouldn t remember giving me this, Miss Schlegel?\" said he, uneasily\nfamiliar.\n\n\"No; I can t say I do.\"\n\n\"Well, that was how it happened, you see.\"\n\n\"Where did we meet, Mr. Bast? For the minute I don t remember.\"\n\n\"It was a concert at the Queen s Hall. I think you will recollect,\" he\nadded pretentiously, \"when I tell you that it included a performance of\nthe Fifth Symphony of Beethoven.\"\n\n\"We hear the Fifth practically every time it s done, so I m not sure--do\nyou remember, Helen?\"\n\n\"Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?\"\n\nHe thought not.\n\n\"Then I don t remember. That s the only Beethoven I ever remember\nspecially.\"\n\n\"And you, if I may say so, took away my umbrella, inadvertently of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Likely enough,\" Helen laughed, \"for I steal umbrellas even oftener than\nI hear Beethoven. Did you get it back?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you, Miss Schlegel.\"\n\n\"The mistake arose out of my card, did it?\" interposed Margaret.\n\n\"Yes, the mistake arose--it was a mistake.\"\n\n\"The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too,\nand that she could find you?\" she continued, pushing him forward, for,\nthough he had promised an explanation, he seemed unable to give one.\n\n\"That s so, calling too--a mistake.\"\n\n\"Then why--?\" began Helen, but Margaret laid a hand on her arm.\n\n\"I said to my wife,\" he continued more rapidly \"I said to Mrs. Bast,  I\nhave to pay a call on some friends,  and Mrs. Bast said to me,  Do go. \nWhile I was gone, however, she wanted me on important business, and\nthought I had come here, owing to the card, and so came after me, and I\nbeg to tender my apologies, and hers as well, for any inconvenience we\nmay have inadvertently caused you.\"\n\n\"No inconvenience,\" said Helen; \"but I still don t understand.\"\n\nAn air of evasion characterised Mr. Bast. He explained again, but was\nobviously lying, and Helen didn t see why he should get off. She had the\ncruelty of youth. Neglecting her sister s pressure, she said, \"I still\ndon t understand. When did you say you paid this call?\"\n\n\"Call? What call?\" said he, staring as if her question had been a\nfoolish one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream.\n\n\"This afternoon call.\"\n\n\"In the afternoon, of course!\" he replied, and looked at Tibby to see\nhow the repartee went. But Tibby was unsympathetic, and said, \"Saturday\nafternoon or Sunday afternoon?\"\n\n\"S--Saturday.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said Helen; \"and you were still calling on Sunday, when your\nwife came here. A long visit.\"\n\n\"I don t call that fair,\" said Mr. Bast, going scarlet and handsome.\nThere was fight in his eyes. \"I know what you mean, and it isn t so.\"\n\n\"Oh, don t let us mind,\" said Margaret, distressed again by odours from\nthe abyss.\n\n\"It was something else,\" he asserted, his elaborate manner breaking\ndown. \"I was somewhere else to what you think, so there!\"\n\n\"It was good of you to come and explain,\" she said. \"The rest is\nnaturally no concern of ours.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I want--I wanted--have you ever read The Ordeal of Richard\nFeverel?\"\n\nMargaret nodded.\n\n\"It s a beautiful book. I wanted to get back to the earth, don t you\nsee, like Richard does in the end. Or have you ever read Stevenson s\nPrince Otto?\"\n\nHelen and Tibby groaned gently.\n\n\"That s another beautiful book. You get back to the earth in that. I\nwanted--\" He mouthed affectedly. Then through the mists of his culture\ncame a hard fact, hard as a pebble. \"I walked all the Saturday night,\"\n said Leonard. \"I walked.\" A thrill of approval ran through the sisters.\nBut culture closed in again. He asked whether they had ever read E. V.\nLucas s Open Road.\n\nSaid Helen, \"No doubt it s another beautiful book, but I d rather hear\nabout your road.\"\n\n\"Oh, I walked.\"\n\n\"How far?\"\n\n\"I don t know, nor for how long. It got too dark to see my watch.\"\n\n\"Were you walking alone, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, straightening himself; \"but we d been talking it over at\nthe office. There s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these\nthings. The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked\nit up in the celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so\nmixed.\"\n\n\"Don t talk to me about the Pole Star,\" interrupted Helen, who was\nbecoming interested. \"I know its little ways. It goes round and round,\nand you go round after it.\"\n\n\"Well, I lost it entirely. First of all the street lamps, then the\ntrees, and towards morning it got cloudy.\"\n\nTibby, who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from the room. He\nknew that this fellow would never attain to poetry, and did not want to\nhear him trying.\n\nMargaret and Helen remained. Their brother influenced them more than\nthey knew; in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily.\n\n\"Where did you start from?\" cried Margaret. \"Do tell us more.\"\n\n\"I took the Underground to Wimbledon. As I came out of the office I said\nto myself,  I must have a walk once in a way. If I don t take this walk\nnow, I shall never take it.  I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon, and\nthen--\"\n\n\"But not good country there, is it?\"\n\n\"It was gas-lamps for hours. Still, I had all the night, and being out\nwas the great thing. I did get into woods, too, presently.\"\n\n\"Yes, go on,\" said Helen.\n\n\"You ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark.\"\n\n\"Did you actually go off the roads?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I always meant to go off the roads, but the worst of it is that\nit s more difficult to find one s way.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bast, you re a born adventurer,\" laughed Margaret. \"No professional\nathlete would have attempted what you ve done. It s a wonder your walk\ndidn t end in a broken neck. Whatever did your wife say?\"\n\n\"Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses,\" said\nHelen. \"Besides, they can t walk. It tires them. Go on.\"\n\n\"I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the wood. This  ere wood. How did you get out of it?\"\n\n\"I managed one wood, and found a road the other side which went a good\nbit uphill. I rather fancy it was those North Downs, for the road went\noff into grass, and I got into another wood. That was awful, with gorse\nbushes. I did wish I d never come, but suddenly it got light--just while\nI seemed going under one tree. Then I found a road down to a station,\nand took the first train I could back to London.\"\n\n\"But was the dawn wonderful?\" asked Helen.\n\nWith unforgettable sincerity he replied, \"No.\" The word flew again like\na pebble from the sling. Down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or\nliterary in his talk, down toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the \"love of\nthe earth\" and his silk top-hat. In the presence of these women Leonard\nhad arrived, and he spoke with a flow, an exultation, that he had seldom\nknown.\n\n\"The dawn was only grey, it was nothing to mention.\"\n\n\"Just a grey evening turned upside down. I know.\"\n\n\"--and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it, and so cold\ntoo. I m glad I did it, and yet at the time it bored me more than I can\nsay. And besides--you can believe me or not as you choose--I was very\nhungry. That dinner at Wimbledon--I meant it to last me all night\nlike other dinners. I never thought that walking would make such a\ndifference. Why, when you re walking you want, as it were, a breakfast\nand luncheon and tea during the night as well, and I d nothing but a\npacket of Woodbines. Lord, I did feel bad! Looking back, it wasn t what\nyou may call enjoyment. It was more a case of sticking to it. I did\nstick. I--I was determined. Oh, hang it all! what s the good--I mean,\nthe good of living in a room for ever? There one goes on day after day,\nsame old game, same up and down to town, until you forget there is any\nother game. You ought to see once in a way what s going on outside, if\nit s only nothing particular after all.\"\n\n\"I should just think you ought,\" said Helen, sitting on the edge of the\ntable.\n\nThe sound of a lady s voice recalled him from sincerity, and he said:\n\"Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard\nJefferies.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Bast, but you re wrong there. It didn t. It came from\nsomething far greater.\"\n\nBut she could not stop him. Borrow was imminent after Jefferies--Borrow,\nThoreau, and sorrow. R. L. S. brought up the rear, and the outburst\nended in a swamp of books. No disrespect to these great names. The fault\nis ours, not theirs. They mean us to use them for sign-posts, and are not\nto blame if, in our weakness, we mistake the sign-post for the destination.\nAnd Leonard had reached the destination. He had visited the county of\nSurrey when darkness covered its amenities, and its cosy villas had\nre-entered ancient night. Every twelve hours this miracle happens, but he\nhad troubled to go and see for himself. Within his cramped little mind\ndwelt something that was greater than Jefferies  books--the spirit that led\nJefferies to write them; and his dawn, though revealing nothing but\nmonotones, was part of the eternal sunrise that shows George Borrow\nStonehenge.\n\n\"Then you don t think I was foolish?\" he asked becoming again the naive\nand sweet-tempered boy for whom Nature intended him.\n\n\"Heavens, no!\" replied Margaret.\n\n\"Heaven help us if we do!\" replied Helen.\n\n\"I m very glad you say that. Now, my wife would never understand--not if\nI explained for days.\"\n\n\"No, it wasn t foolish!\" cried Helen, her eyes aflame. \"You ve pushed\nback the boundaries; I think it splendid of you.\"\n\n\"You ve not been content to dream as we have--\"\n\n\"Though we have walked, too--\"\n\n\"I must show you a picture upstairs--\"\n\nHere the door-bell rang. The hansom had come to take them to their\nevening party.\n\n\"Oh, bother, not to say dash--I had forgotten we were dining out; but\ndo, do, come round again and have a talk.\" \"Yes, you must--do,\" echoed\nMargaret.\n\nLeonard, with extreme sentiment, replied: \"No, I shall not. It s better\nlike this.\"\n\n\"Why better?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I shall always look\nback on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life.\nReally. I mean this. We can never repeat. It has done me real good, and\nthere we had better leave it.\"\n\n\"That s rather a sad view of life, surely.\"\n\n\"Things so often get spoiled.\"\n\n\"I know,\" flashed Helen, \"but people don t.\"\n\nHe could not understand this. He continued in a vein which mingled true\nimagination and false. What he said wasn t wrong, but it wasn t right,\nand a false note jarred. One little twist, they felt, and the instrument\nmight be in tune. One little strain, and it might be silent for ever. He\nthanked the ladies very much, but he would not call again. There was a\nmoment s awkwardness, and then Helen said: \"Go, then; perhaps you know\nbest; but never forget you re better than Jefferies.\" And he went. Their\nhansom caught him up at the corner, passed with a waving of hands, and\nvanished with its accomplished load into the evening.\n\nLondon was beginning to illuminate herself against the night. Electric\nlights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares, gas-lamps in the\nside streets glimmered a canary gold or green. The sky was a crimson\nbattlefield of spring, but London was not afraid. Her smoke mitigated\nthe splendour, and the clouds down Oxford Street were a delicately\npainted ceiling, which adorned while it did not distract. She had never\nknown the clear-cut armies of the purer air. Leonard hurried through her\ntinted wonders, very much part of the picture. His was a grey life,\nand to brighten it he had ruled off a few corners for romance. The Miss\nSchlegels--or, to speak more accurately, his interview with them--were\nto fill such a corner, nor was it by any means the first time that\nhe had talked intimately to strangers. The habit was analogous to a\ndebauch, an outlet, though the worst of outlets, for instincts that\nwould not be denied. Terrifying him, it would beat down his suspicions\nand prudence until he was confiding secrets to people whom he had\nscarcely seen. It brought him many fears and some pleasant memories.\nPerhaps the keenest happiness he had ever known was during a railway\njourney to Cambridge, where a decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken\nto him. They had got into conversation, and gradually Leonard flung\nreticence aside, told some of his domestic troubles and hinted at the\nrest. The undergraduate, supposing they could start a friendship, asked\nhim to \"coffee after hall,\" which he accepted, but afterwards grew shy,\nand took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he lodged.\nHe did not want Romance to collide with the Porphyrion, still less with\nJacky, and people with fuller, happier lives are slow to understand\nthis. To the Schlegels, as to the undergraduate, he was an interesting\ncreature, of whom they wanted to see more. But they to him were denizens\nof Romance, who must keep to the corner he had assigned them, pictures\nthat must not walk out of their frames.\n\nHis behaviour over Margaret s visiting-card had been typical. His\nhad scarcely been a tragic marriage. Where there is no money and no\ninclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated. He could not leave\nhis wife, and he did not want to hit her. Petulance and squalor were\nenough. Here \"that card\" had come in. Leonard, though furtive, was\nuntidy, and left it lying about. Jacky found it, and then began, \"What s\nthat card, eh?\" \"Yes, don t you wish you knew what that card was?\" \"Len,\nwho s Miss Schlegel?\" etc. Months passed, and the card, now as a joke,\nnow as a grievance, was handed about, getting dirtier and dirtier. It\nfollowed them when they moved from Camelia Road to Tulse Hill. It was\nsubmitted to third parties. A few inches of pasteboard, it became the\nbattlefield on which the souls of Leonard and his wife contended. Why\ndid he not say, \"A lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I\nmight call for my umbrella\"? Because Jacky would have disbelieved him?\nPartly, but chiefly because he was sentimental. No affection gathered\nround the card, but it symbolised the life of culture, that Jacky should\nnever spoil. At night he would say to himself, \"Well, at all events, she\ndoesn t know about that card. Yah! done her there!\"\n\nPoor Jacky! she was not a bad sort, and had a great deal to bear.\nShe drew her own conclusion--she was only capable of drawing one\nconclusion--and in the fulness of time she acted upon it. All the Friday\nLeonard had refused to speak to her, and had spent the evening observing\nthe stars. On the Saturday he went up, as usual, to town, but he came\nnot back Saturday night, nor Sunday morning, nor Sunday afternoon. The\ninconvenience grew intolerable, and though she was now of a retiring\nhabit, and shy of women, she went up to Wickham Place. Leonard returned\nin her absence. The card, the fatal card, was gone from the pages of\nRuskin, and he guessed what had happened.\n\n\"Well?\" he had exclaimed, greeting her with peals of laughter. \"I know\nwhere you ve been, but you don t know where I ve been.\"\n\nJacky sighed, said, \"Len, I do think you might explain,\" and resumed\ndomesticity.\n\nExplanations were difficult at this stage, and Leonard was too silly--or\nit is tempting to write, too sound a chap to attempt them. His reticence\nwas not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes, the\nreticence that pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind\nthe Daily Telegraph. The adventurer, also, is reticent, and it is an\nadventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness. You may laugh\nat him, you who have slept nights out on the veldt, with your rifle\nbeside you and all the atmosphere of adventure pat. And you also may\nlaugh who think adventures silly. But do not be surprised if Leonard is\nshy whenever he meets you, and if the Schlegels rather than Jacky hear\nabout the dawn.\n\nThat the Schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent\njoy. He was at his best when he thought of them. It buoyed him as he\njourneyed home beneath fading heavens. Somehow the barriers of wealth\nhad fallen, and there had been--he could not phrase it--a general\nassertion of the wonder of the world. \"My conviction,\" says the mystic,\n\"gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it,\" and they\nhad agreed that there was something beyond life s daily grey. He took\noff his top-hat and smoothed it thoughtfully. He had hitherto supposed\nthe unknown to be books, literature, clever conversation, culture. One\nraised oneself by study, and got upsides with the world. But in that\nquick interchange a new light dawned. Was that \"something\" walking in\nthe dark among the suburban hills?\n\nHe discovered that he was going bareheaded down Regent Street. London\ncame back with a rush. Few were about at this hour, but all whom he\npassed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive\nbecause it was unconscious. He put his hat on. It was too big; his head\ndisappeared like a pudding into a basin, the ears bending outwards at\nthe touch of the curly brim. He wore it a little backwards, and its\neffect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance\nbetween the eyes and the moustache. Thus equipped, he escaped criticism.\nNo one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements, the heart of a\nman ticking fast in his chest.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XV\n\nThe sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure, and when they\nwere both full of the same subject, there were few dinner-parties that\ncould stand up against them. This particular one, which was all ladies,\nhad more kick in it than most, but succumbed after a struggle. Helen at\none part of the table, Margaret at the other, would talk of Mr. Bast\nand of no one else, and somewhere about the entree their monologues\ncollided, fell ruining, and became common property. Nor was this all.\nThe dinner-party was really an informal discussion club; there was a\npaper after it, read amid coffee-cups and laughter in the drawing-room,\nbut dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general\ninterest. After the paper came a debate, and in this debate Mr. Bast\nalso figured, appearing now as a bright spot in civilisation, now as a\ndark spot, according to the temperament of the speaker. The subject of\nthe paper had been, \"How ought I to dispose of my money?\" the reader\nprofessing to be a millionaire on the point of death, inclined to\nbequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries, but open\nto conviction from other sources. The various parts had been assigned\nbeforehand, and some of the speeches were amusing. The hostess assumed\nthe ungrateful role of \"the millionaire s eldest son,\" and implored her\nexpiring parent not to dislocate Society by allowing such vast sums\nto pass out of the family. Money was the fruit of self-denial, and the\nsecond generation had a right to profit by the self-denial of the first.\nWhat right had \"Mr. Bast\" to profit? The National Gallery was good\nenough for the likes of him. After property had had its say--a saying\nthat is necessarily ungracious--the various philanthropists stepped\nforward. Something must be done for \"Mr. Bast\"; his conditions must\nbe improved without impairing his independence; he must have a free\nlibrary, or free tennis-courts; his rent must be paid in such a way that\nhe did not know it was being paid; it must be made worth his while to\njoin the Territorials; he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring\nwife, the money going to her as compensation; he must be assigned a\nTwin Star, some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him\nceaselessly (groans from Helen); he must be given food but no clothes,\nclothes but no food, a third-return ticket to Venice, without either\nfood or clothes when he arrived there. In short, he might be given\nanything and everything so long as it was not the money itself.\n\nAnd here Margaret interrupted.\n\n\"Order, order, Miss Schlegel!\" said the reader of the paper. \"You are\nhere, I understand, to advise me in the interests of the Society for the\nPreservation of Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. I cannot\nhave you speaking out of your role. It makes my poor head go round, and\nI think you forget that I am very ill.\"\n\n\"Your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument,\" said\nMargaret. \"Why not give him the money itself? You re supposed to have\nabout thirty thousand a year.\"\n\n\"Have I? I thought I had a million.\"\n\n\"Wasn t a million your capital? Dear me! we ought to have settled that.\nStill, it doesn t matter. Whatever you ve got, I order you to give as\nmany poor men as you can three hundred a year each.\"\n\n\"But that would be pauperising them,\" said an earnest girl, who liked\nthe Schlegels, but thought them a little unspiritual at times.\n\n\"Not if you gave them so much. A big windfall would not pauperise a man.\nIt is these little driblets, distributed among too many, that do the\nharm. Money s educational. It s far more educational than the things\nit buys.\" There was a protest. \"In a sense,\" added Margaret, but the\nprotest continued. \"Well, isn t the most civilized thing going, the man\nwho has learnt to wear his income properly?\"\n\n\"Exactly what your Mr. Basts won t do.\"\n\n\"Give them a chance. Give them money. Don t dole them out poetry-books\nand railway-tickets like babies. Give them the wherewithal to buy these\nthings. When your Socialism comes it may be different, and we may think\nin terms of commodities instead of cash. Till it comes give people\ncash, for it is the warp of civilisation, whatever the woof may be. The\nimagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly, for it s\nthe--the second most important thing in the world. It is so slurred over\nand hushed up, there is so little clear thinking--oh, political economy,\nof course, but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes,\nand admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the\nresult of independent means. Money: give Mr. Bast money, and don t\nbother about his ideals. He ll pick up those for himself.\"\n\nShe leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to\nmisconstrue her. The female mind, though cruelly practical in daily\nlife, cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation, and Miss\nSchlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things, and what\nit would profit Mr. Bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own\nsoul. She answered, \"Nothing, but he would not gain his soul until\nhe had gained a little of the world.\" Then they said, \"No, we do not\nbelieve it,\" and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul\nin the superterrestrial sense, where the effort will be taken for the\ndeed, but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources\nof this world, will ever know the rarer joys of the body, or attain to\nclear and passionate intercourse with his fellows. Others had attacked\nthe fabric of Society--Property, Interest, etc.; she only fixed her eyes\non a few human beings, to see how, under present conditions, they could\nbe made happier. Doing good to humanity was useless: the many-coloured\nefforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in\nan universal grey. To do good to one, or, as in this case, to a few, was\nthe utmost she dare hope for.\n\nBetween the idealists, and the political economists, Margaret had a\nbad time. Disagreeing elsewhere, they agreed in disowning her, and\nin keeping the administration of the millionaire s money in their\nown hands. The earnest girl brought forward a scheme of \"personal\nsupervision and mutual help,\" the effect of which was to alter poor\npeople until they became exactly like people who were not so poor. The\nhostess pertinently remarked that she, as eldest son, might surely rank\namong the millionaire s legatees. Margaret weakly admitted the claim,\nand another claim was at once set up by Helen, who declared that she\nhad been the millionaire s housemaid for over forty years, overfed and\nunderpaid; was nothing to be done for her, so corpulent and poor? The\nmillionaire then read out her last will and testament, in which she left\nthe whole of her fortune to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Then she\ndied. The serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than\nthe playful--in a men s debate is the reverse more general?--but the\nmeeting broke up hilariously enough, and a dozen happy ladies dispersed\nto their homes.\n\nHelen and Margaret walked with the earnest girl as far as Battersea\nBridge Station, arguing copiously all the way. When she had gone\nthey were conscious of an alleviation, and of the great beauty of the\nevening. They turned back towards Oakley Street. The lamps and the\nplane-trees, following the line of the embankment, struck a note of\ndignity that is rare in English cities. The seats, almost deserted, were\nhere and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress, who had strolled\nout from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the\nrising tide. There is something continental about Chelsea Embankment. It\nis an open space used rightly, a blessing more frequent in Germany than\nhere. As Margaret and Helen sat down, the city behind them seemed to\nbe a vast theatre, an opera-house in which some endless trilogy was\nperforming, and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers, who did\nnot mind losing a little of the second act.\n\n\"Cold?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Tired?\"\n\n\"Doesn t matter.\"\n\nThe earnest girl s train rumbled away over the bridge.\n\n\"I say, Helen--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Are we really going to follow up Mr. Bast?\"\n\n\"I don t know.\"\n\n\"I think we won t.\"\n\n\"As you like.\"\n\n\"It s no good, I think, unless you really mean to know people. The\ndiscussion brought that home to me. We got on well enough with him in a\nspirit of excitement, but think of rational intercourse. We mustn t play\nat friendship. No, it s no good.\"\n\n\"There s Mrs. Lanoline, too,\" Helen yawned. \"So dull.\"\n\n\"Just so, and possibly worse than dull.\"\n\n\"I should like to know how he got hold of your card.\"\n\n\"But he said--something about a concert and an umbrella.\"\n\n\"Then did the card see the wife--\"\n\n\"Helen, come to bed.\"\n\n\"No, just a little longer, it is so beautiful. Tell me; oh yes; did you\nsay money is the warp of the world?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then what s the woof?\"\n\n\"Very much what one chooses,\" said Margaret. \"It s something that isn t\nmoney--one can t say more.\"\n\n\"Walking at night?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"For Tibby, Oxford?\"\n\n\"It seems so.\"\n\n\"For you?\"\n\n\"Now that we have to leave Wickham Place, I begin to think it s that.\nFor Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End.\"\n\nOne s own name will carry immense distances. Mr. Wilcox, who was sitting\nwith friends many seats away, heard this, rose to his feet, and strolled\nalong towards the speakers.\n\n\"It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than\npeople,\" continued Margaret.\n\n\"Why, Meg? They re so much nicer generally. I d rather think of that\nforester s house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who\nlived in it.\"\n\n\"I believe we shall come to care about people less and less, Helen. The\nmore people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them. It s one\nof the curses of London. I quite expect to end my life caring most for a\nplace.\"\n\nHere Mr. Wilcox reached them. It was several weeks since they had met.\n\n\"How do you do?\" he cried. \"I thought I recognised your voices. Whatever\nare you both doing down here?\"\n\nHis tones were protective. He implied that one ought not to sit out\non Chelsea Embankment without a male escort. Helen resented this, but\nMargaret accepted it as part of the good man s equipment.\n\n\"What an age it is since I ve seen you, Mr. Wilcox. I met Evie in the\nTube, though, lately. I hope you have good news of your son.\"\n\n\"Paul?\" said Mr. Wilcox, extinguishing his cigarette, and sitting down\nbetween them. \"Oh, Paul s all right. We had a line from Madeira. He ll\nbe at work again by now.\"\n\n\"Ugh--\" said Helen, shuddering from complex causes.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Isn t the climate of Nigeria too horrible?\"\n\n\"Some one s got to go,\" he said simply. \"England will never keep her\ntrade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices. Unless we get\nfirm in West Africa, Ger--untold complications may follow. Now tell me\nall your news.\"\n\n\"Oh, we ve had a splendid evening,\" cried Helen, who always woke up at\nthe advent of a visitor. \"We belong to a kind of club that reads papers,\nMargaret and I--all women, but there is a discussion after. This evening\nit was on how one ought to leave one s money--whether to one s family,\nor to the poor, and if so how--oh, most interesting.\"\n\nThe man of business smiled. Since his wife s death he had almost doubled\nhis income. He was an important figure at last, a reassuring name on\ncompany prospectuses, and life had treated him very well. The world\nseemed in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames, which still\nflowed inland from the sea. So wonderful to the girls, it held no\nmysteries for him. He had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by\ntaking shares in the lock at Teddington, and if he and other capitalists\nthought good, some day it could be shortened again. With a good dinner\ninside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank, he felt\nthat his hands were on all the ropes of life, and that what he did not\nknow could not be worth knowing.\n\n\"Sounds a most original entertainment!\" he exclaimed, and laughed in\nhis pleasant way. \"I wish Evie would go to that sort of thing. But she\nhasn t the time. She s taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers--jolly little\ndogs.\"\n\n\"I expect we d better be doing the same, really.\"\n\n\"We pretend we re improving ourselves, you see,\" said Helen a little\nsharply, for the Wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns, and she\nhad bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made\nwould have impressed her favourably. \"We suppose it a good thing to\nwaste an evening once a fortnight over a debate, but, as my sister says,\nit may be better to breed dogs.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I don t agree with your sister. There s nothing like a\ndebate to teach one quickness. I often wish I had gone in for them when\nI was a youngster. It would have helped me no end.\"\n\n\"Quickness--?\"\n\n\"Yes. Quickness in argument. Time after time I ve missed scoring a point\nbecause the other man has had the gift of the gab and I haven t. Oh, I\nbelieve in these discussions.\"\n\nThe patronising tone, thought Margaret, came well enough from a man who\nwas old enough to be their father. She had always maintained that Mr.\nWilcox had a charm. In times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had\npained her, but it was pleasant to listen to him now, and to watch his\nthick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars. But Helen\nwas nettled. The aim of their debates she implied was Truth.\n\n\"Oh yes, it doesn t much matter what subject you take,\" said he.\n\nMargaret laughed and said, \"But this is going to be far better than the\ndebate itself.\" Helen recovered herself and laughed too. \"No, I won t go\non,\" she declared. \"I ll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"About Mr. Bast? Yes, do. He ll be more lenient to a special case.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Wilcox, do first light another cigarette. It s this. We ve\njust come across a young fellow, who s evidently very poor, and who\nseems interest--\"\n\n\"What s his profession?\"\n\n\"Clerk.\"\n\n\"What in?\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Margaret?\"\n\n\"Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new hearth rug. He seems\ninteresting, in some ways very, and one wishes one could help him. He is\nmarried to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much. He likes books,\nand what one may roughly call adventure, and if he had a chance--But he\nis so poor. He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense\nand clothes. One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong\nfor him and that he will sink. Well, he got mixed up in our debate. He\nwasn t the subject of it, but it seemed to bear on his point. Suppose\na millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such a man. How\nshould he be helped? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year\ndirect, which was Margaret s plan? Most of them thought this would\npauperise him. Should he and those like him be given free libraries?\nI said  No!  He doesn t want more books to read, but to read books\nrightly. My suggestion was he should be given something every year\ntowards a summer holiday, but then there is his wife, and they said she\nwould have to go too. Nothing seemed quite right! Now what do you think?\nImagine that you were a millionaire, and wanted to help the poor. What\nwould you do?\"\n\nMr. Wilcox, whose fortune was not so very far below the standard\nindicated, laughed exuberantly. \"My dear Miss Schlegel, I will not rush\nin where your sex has been unable to tread. I will not add another plan\nto the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested. My only\ncontribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion\nFire Insurance Company with all possible speed.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Margaret.\n\nHe lowered his voice. \"This is between friends. It ll be in the\nReceiver s hands before Christmas. It ll smash,\" he added, thinking that\nshe had not understood.\n\n\"Dear me, Helen, listen to that. And he ll have to get another place!\"\n\n\"WILL have? Let him leave the ship before it sinks. Let him get one\nnow.\"\n\n\"Rather than wait, to make sure?\"\n\n\"Decidedly.\"\n\n\"Why s that?\"\n\nAgain the Olympian laugh, and the lowered voice. \"Naturally the man\nwho s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance, is in a\nstronger position, that the man who isn t. It looks as if he s worth\nsomething. I know by myself--(this is letting you into the State\nsecrets)--it affects an employer greatly. Human nature, I m afraid.\"\n\n\"I hadn t thought of that,\" murmured Margaret, while Helen said, \"Our\nhuman nature appears to be the other way round. We employ people because\nthey re unemployed. The boot man, for instance.\"\n\n\"And how does he clean the boots?\"\n\n\"Not well,\" confessed Margaret.\n\n\"There you are!\"\n\n\"Then do you really advise us to tell this youth--?\"\n\n\"I advise nothing,\" he interrupted, glancing up and down the Embankment,\nin case his indiscretion had been overheard. \"I oughtn t to have\nspoken--but I happen to know, being more or less behind the scenes. The\nPorphyrion s a bad, bad concern--Now, don t say I said so. It s outside\nthe Tariff Ring.\"\n\n\"Certainly I won t say. In fact, I don t know what that means.\"\n\n\"I thought an insurance company never smashed,\" was Helen s\ncontribution. \"Don t the others always run in and save them?\"\n\n\"You re thinking of reinsurance,\" said Mr. Wilcox mildly. \"It is exactly\nthere that the Porphyrion is weak. It has tried to undercut, has been\nbadly hit by a long series of small fires, and it hasn t been able to\nreinsure. I m afraid that public companies don t save one another for\nlove.\"\n\n\" Human nature,  I suppose,\" quoted Helen, and he laughed and agreed\nthat it was. When Margaret said that she supposed that clerks, like\nevery one else, found it extremely difficult to get situations in these\ndays, he replied, \"Yes, extremely,\" and rose to rejoin his friends. He\nknew by his own office--seldom a vacant post, and hundreds of applicants\nfor it; at present no vacant post.\n\n\"And how s Howards End looking?\" said Margaret, wishing to change the\nsubject before they parted. Mr. Wilcox was a little apt to think one\nwanted to get something out of him.\n\n\"It s let.\"\n\n\"Really. And you wandering homeless in longhaired Chelsea? How strange\nare the ways of Fate!\"\n\n\"No; it s let unfurnished. We ve moved.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought of you both as anchored there for ever. Evie never told\nme.\"\n\n\"I dare say when you met Evie the thing wasn t settled. We only moved\na week ago. Paul has rather a feeling for the old place, and we held on\nfor him to have his holiday there; but, really, it is impossibly small.\nEndless drawbacks. I forget whether you ve been up to it?\"\n\n\"As far as the house, never.\"\n\n\"Well, Howards End is one of those converted farms. They don t really\ndo, spend what you will on them. We messed away with a garage all among\nthe wych-elm roots, and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and\nattempted a rockery. Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants. But it\ndidn t do--no, it didn t do. You remember, your sister will remember,\nthe farm with those abominable guinea-fowls, and the hedge that the old\nwoman never would cut properly, so that it all went thin at the\nbottom. And, inside the house, the beams--and the staircase through a\ndoor--picturesque enough, but not a place to live in.\" He glanced\nover the parapet cheerfully. \"Full tide. And the position wasn t right\neither. The neighbourhood s getting suburban. Either be in London or out\nof it, I say; so we ve taken a house in Ducie Street, close to Sloane\nStreet, and a place right down in Shropshire--Oniton Grange. Ever heard\nof Oniton? Do come and see us--right away from everywhere, up towards\nWales.\"\n\n\"What a change!\" said Margaret. But the change was in her own voice,\nwhich had become most sad. \"I can t imagine Howards End or Hilton\nwithout you.\"\n\n\"Hilton isn t without us,\" he replied. \"Charles is there still.\"\n\n\"Still?\" said Margaret, who had not kept up with the Charles s. \"But I\nthought he was still at Epsom. They were furnishing that Christmas--one\nChristmas. How everything alters! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our\nwindows very often. Wasn t it Epsom?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they moved eighteen months ago. Charles, the good chap\"--his\nvoice dropped--\"thought I should be lonely. I didn t want him to move,\nbut he would, and took a house at the other end of Hilton, down by\nthe Six Hills. He had a motor, too. There they all are, a very jolly\nparty--he and she and the two grandchildren.\"\n\n\"I manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them\nthemselves,\" said Margaret as they shook hands. \"When you moved out of\nHowards End, I should have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it. I should\nhave kept so remarkable a place in the family.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" he replied. \"I haven t sold it, and don t mean to.\"\n\n\"No; but none of you are there.\"\n\n\"Oh, we ve got a splendid tenant--Hamar Bryce, an invalid. If\nCharles ever wanted it--but he won t. Dolly is so dependent on modern\nconveniences. No, we have all decided against Howards End.

You re doing yourself\nproud, Mr. Wilcox. My congratulations.\"\n\n\"And mine,\" said Helen.\n\n\"Do remind Evie to come and see us--2 Wickham Place. We shan t be there\nvery long, either.\"\n\n\"You, too, on the move?\"\n\n\"Next September,\" Margaret sighed.\n\n\"Every one moving! Good-bye.\"\n\nThe tide had begun to ebb. Margaret leant over the parapet and watched\nit sadly. Mr. Wilcox had forgotten his wife, Helen her lover; she\nherself was probably forgetting. Every one moving. Is it worth while\nattempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts\nof men?\n\nHelen roused her by saying: \"What a prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has\ngrown! I have very little use for him in these days. However, he did\ntell us about the Porphyrion. Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever\nwe get home, and tell him to clear out of it at once.\"\n\n\"Do; yes, that s worth doing. Let us.\"\n\n\n\n",

He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes. One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink. Well, he got mixed up in our debate.

Should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct, which was Margaret s plan? Most of them thought this would pauperise him. Should he and those like him be given free libraries? I said  No!

        "raw text": " XVI\n\nLeonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday. But he was right;\nthe visit proved a conspicuous failure.\n\n\"Sugar?\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Cake?\" said Helen. \"The big cake or the little deadlies? I m afraid\nyou thought my letter rather odd, but we ll explain--we aren t odd,\nreally--nor affected, really. We re over-expressive--that s all.\"\n\nAs a lady s lap-dog Leonard did not excel. He was not an Italian,\nstill less a Frenchman, in whose blood there runs the very spirit of\npersiflage and of gracious repartee. His wit was the Cockney s; it\nopened no doors into imagination, and Helen was drawn up short by \"The\nmore a lady has to say, the better,\" administered waggishly.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said.\n\n\"Ladies brighten--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. The darlings are regular sunbeams. Let me give you a\nplate.\"\n\n\"How do you like your work?\" interposed Margaret.\n\nHe, too, was drawn up short. He would not have these women prying into\nhis work. They were Romance, and so was the room to which he had at last\npenetrated, with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls,\nand so were the very tea-cups, with their delicate borders of wild\nstrawberries. But he would not let romance interfere with his life.\nThere is the devil to pay then.\n\n\"Oh, well enough,\" he answered.\n\n\"Your company is the Porphyrion, isn t it?\"\n\n\"Yes, that s so.\"--becoming rather offended. \"It s funny how things get\nround.\"\n\n\"Why funny?\" asked Helen, who did not follow the workings of his mind.\n\"It was written as large as life on your card, and considering we wrote\nto you there, and that you replied on the stamped paper--\"\n\n\"Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance Companies?\"\n pursued Margaret.\n\n\"It depends on what you call big.\"\n\n\"I mean by big, a solid, well-established concern, that offers a\nreasonably good career to its employes.\"\n\n\"I couldn t say--some would tell you one thing and others another,\" said\nthe employee uneasily. \"For my own part\"--he shook his head--\"I only\nbelieve half I hear. Not that even; it s safer. Those clever ones come\nto the worse grief, I ve often noticed. Ah, you can t be too careful.\"\n\nHe drank, and wiped his moustache, which was going to be one of those\nmoustaches that always droop into tea-cups--more bother than they re\nworth, surely, and not fashionable either.\n\n\"I quite agree, and that s why I was curious to know; is it a solid,\nwell-established concern?\"\n\nLeonard had no idea. He understood his own corner of the machine,\nbut nothing beyond it. He desired to confess neither knowledge nor\nignorance, and under these circumstances, another motion of the head\nseemed safest. To him, as to the British public, the Porphyrion was the\nPorphyrion of the advertisement--a giant, in the classical style, but\ndraped sufficiently, who held in one hand a burning torch, and pointed\nwith the other to St. Paul s and Windsor Castle. A large sum of money\nwas inscribed below, and you drew your own conclusions. This giant\ncaused Leonard to do arithmetic and write letters, to explain the\nregulations to new clients, and re-explain them to old ones. A giant\nwas of an impulsive morality--one knew that much. He would pay for\nMrs. Munt s hearthrug with ostentatious haste, a large claim he would\nrepudiate quietly, and fight court by court. But his true fighting\nweight, his antecedents, his amours with other members of the commercial\nPantheon--all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the\nescapades of Zeus. While the gods are powerful, we learn little about\nthem. It is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light\nbeats into heaven.\n\n\"We were told the Porphyrion s no go,\" blurted Helen. \"We wanted to tell\nyou; that s why we wrote.\"\n\n\"A friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured,\" said\nMargaret.\n\nNow Leonard had his clue.\n\nHe must praise the Porphyrion. \"You can tell your friend,\" he said,\n\"that he s quite wrong.\"\n\n\"Oh, good!\"\n\nThe young man coloured a little. In his circle to be wrong was fatal.\nThe Miss Schlegels did not mind being wrong. They were genuinely glad\nthat they had been misinformed. To them nothing was fatal but evil.\n\n\"Wrong, so to speak,\" he added.\n\n\"How  so to speak ?\"\n\n\"I mean I wouldn t say he s right altogether.\"\n\nBut this was a blunder. \"Then he is right partly,\" said the elder woman,\nquick as lightning.\n\nLeonard replied that every one was right partly, if it came to that.\n\n\"Mr. Bast, I don t understand business, and I dare say my questions are\nstupid, but can you tell me what makes a concern  right  or  wrong ?\"\n\nLeonard sat back with a sigh.\n\n\"Our friend, who is also a business man, was so positive. He said before\nChristmas--\"\n\n\"And advised you to clear out of it,\" concluded Helen. \"But I don t see\nwhy he should know better than you do.\"\n\nLeonard rubbed his hands. He was tempted to say that he knew nothing\nabout the thing at all. But a commercial training was too strong for\nhim. Nor could he say it was a bad thing, for this would be giving\nit away; nor yet that it was good, for this would be giving it away\nequally. He attempted to suggest that it was something between the two,\nwith vast possibilities in either direction, but broke down under the\ngaze of four sincere eyes. And yet he scarcely distinguished between\nthe two sisters. One was more beautiful and more lively, but \"the Miss\nSchlegels\" still remained a composite Indian god, whose waving arms and\ncontradictory speeches were the product of a single mind.\n\n\"One can but see,\" he remarked, adding, \"as Ibsen says,  things\nhappen. \" He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his\nromantic hour. Minute after minute slipped away, while the ladies, with\nimperfect skill, discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their\nanonymous friend. Leonard grew annoyed--perhaps rightly. He made vague\nremarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being\ntalked over by others, but they did not take the hint. Men might have\nshown more tact. Women, however tactful elsewhere, are heavy-handed\nhere. They cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects\nin a veil. \"How much exactly have you, and how much do you expect to\nhave next June?\" And these were women with a theory, who held that\nreticence about money matters is absurd, and that life would be truer\nif each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he\nstands, the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is\nnot money. How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise?\n\nAnd the precious minutes slipped away, and Jacky and squalor came\nnearer. At last he could bear it no longer, and broke in, reciting\nthe names of books feverishly. There was a moment of piercing joy when\nMargaret said, \"So YOU like Carlyle\" and then the door opened, and \"Mr.\nWilcox, Miss Wilcox\" entered, preceded by two prancing puppies.\n\n\"Oh, the dears! Oh, Evie, how too impossibly sweet!\" screamed Helen,\nfalling on her hands and knees.\n\n\"We brought the little fellows round,\" said Mr. Wilcox.\n\n\"I bred  em myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, really! Mr. Bast, come and play with puppies.\"\n\n\"I ve got to be going now,\" said Leonard sourly.\n\n\"But play with puppies a little first.\"\n\n\"This is Ahab, that s Jezebel,\" said Evie, who was one of those who name\nanimals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history.\n\n\"I ve got to be going.\"\n\nHelen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him.\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Ba--Must you be really? Good-bye!\"\n\n\"Come again,\" said Helen from the floor.\n\nThen Leonard s gorge arose. Why should he come again? What was the good\nof it? He said roundly: \"No, I shan t; I knew it would be a failure.\"\n\nMost people would have let him go. \"A little mistake. We tried knowing\nanother class--impossible.\"\n\nBut the Schlegels had never played with life. They had attempted\nfriendship, and they would take the consequences. Helen retorted, \"I\ncall that a very rude remark. What do you want to turn on me like that\nfor?\" and suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row.\n\n\"You ask me why I turn on you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you want to have me here for?\"\n\n\"To help you, you silly boy!\" cried Helen. \"And don t shout.\"\n\n\"I don t want your patronage. I don t want your tea. I was quite happy.\nWhat do you want to unsettle me for?\" He turned to Mr. Wilcox. \"I put it\nto this gentleman. I ask you, sir, am I to have my brain picked?\"\n\nMr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air of humorous strength that he\ncould so well command. \"Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel? Can we be of\nany use, or shall we go?\"\n\nBut Margaret ignored him.\n\n\"I m connected with a leading insurance company, sir. I receive what I\ntake to be an invitation from these--ladies\" (he drawled the word). \"I\ncome, and it s to have my brain picked. I ask you, is it fair?\"\n\n\"Highly unfair,\" said Mr. Wilcox, drawing a gasp from Evie, who knew\nthat her father was becoming dangerous.\n\n\"There, you hear that? Most unfair, the gentleman says. There! Not\ncontent with\"--pointing at Margaret--\"you can t deny it.\" His voice\nrose; he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with Jacky. \"But as\nsoon as I m useful it s a very different thing.  Oh yes, send for him.\nCross-question him. Pick his brains.  Oh yes. Now, take me on the whole,\nI m a quiet fellow: I m law-abiding, I don t wish any unpleasantness;\nbut I--I--\"\n\n\"You,\" said Margaret--\"you--you--\"\n\nLaughter from Evie as at a repartee.\n\n\"You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star.\"\n\nMore laughter.\n\n\"You saw the sunrise.\"\n\nLaughter.\n\n\"You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all--away past\nbooks and houses to the truth. You were looking for a real home.\"\n\n\"I fail to see the connection,\" said Leonard, hot with stupid anger.\n\n\"So do I.\" There was a pause. \"You were that last Sunday--you are this\nto-day. Mr. Bast! I and my sister have talked you over. We wanted to\nhelp you; we also supposed you might help us. We did not have you here\nout of charity--which bores us--but because we hoped there would be a\nconnection between last Sunday and other days. What is the good of your\nstars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into\nour daily lives? They have never entered into mine, but into yours,\nwe thought--Haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness,\nagainst pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion?\nI struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering\nsome place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you one of these.\"\n\n\"Of course, if there s been any misunderstanding,\" mumbled Leonard, \"all\nI can do is to go. But I beg to state--\" He paused. Ahab and Jezebel\ndanced at his boots and made him look ridiculous. \"You were picking my\nbrain for official information--I can prove it--I--\" He blew his nose\nand left them.\n\n\"Can I help you now?\" said Mr. Wilcox, turning to Margaret. \"May I have\none quiet word with him in the hall?\"\n\n\"Helen, go after him--do anything--anything--to make the noodle\nunderstand.\"\n\nHelen hesitated.\n\n\"But really--\" said their visitor. \"Ought she to?\"\n\nAt once she went.\n\nHe resumed. \"I would have chimed in, but I felt that you could polish\nhim off for yourselves--I didn t interfere. You were splendid, Miss\nSchlegel--absolutely splendid. You can take my word for it, but there\nare very few women who could have managed him.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Margaret distractedly.\n\n\"Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me,\" cried\nEvie.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" chuckled her father; \"all that part about  mechanical\ncheerfulness --oh, fine!\"\n\n\"I m very sorry,\" said Margaret, collecting herself. \"He s a nice\ncreature really. I cannot think what set him off. It has been most\nunpleasant for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn t mind.\" Then he changed his mood. He asked if he might\nspeak as an old friend, and, permission given, said: \"Oughtn t you\nreally to be more careful?\"\n\nMargaret laughed, though her thoughts still strayed after Helen. \"Do you\nrealise that it s all your fault?\" she said. \"You re responsible.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion. We\nwarn him, and--look!\"\n\nMr. Wilcox was annoyed. \"I hardly consider that a fair deduction,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Obviously unfair,\" said Margaret. \"I was only thinking how tangled\nthings are. It s our fault mostly--neither yours nor his.\"\n\n\"Not his?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Miss Schlegel, you are too kind.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" nodded Evie, a little contemptuously.\n\n\"You behave much too well to people, and then they impose on you. I know\nthe world and that type of man, and as soon as I entered the room I saw\nyou had not been treating him properly. You must keep that type at a\ndistance. Otherwise they forget themselves. Sad, but true. They aren t\nour sort, and one must face the fact.\"\n\n\"Ye--es.\"\n\n\"Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"I admit it willingly,\" said Margaret, who was pacing up and down the\nroom. \"A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox watched her with a vague uneasiness.\n\n\"What did he suspect you of?\"\n\n\"Of wanting to make money out of him.\"\n\n\"Intolerable brute! But how were you to benefit?\"\n\n\"Exactly. How indeed! Just horrible, corroding suspicion. One touch of\nthought or of goodwill would have brushed it away. Just the senseless\nfear that does make men intolerable brutes.\"\n\n\"I come back to my original point. You ought to be more careful, Miss\nSchlegel. Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in.\"\n\nShe turned to him frankly. \"Let me explain exactly why we like this man,\nand want to see him again.\"\n\n\"That s your clever way of talking. I shall never believe you like him.\"\n\n\"I do. Firstly, because he cares for physical adventure, just as you\ndo. Yes, you go motoring and shooting; he would like to go camping out.\nSecondly, he cares for something special IN adventure. It is quickest to\ncall that special something poetry--\"\n\n\"Oh, he s one of that writer sort.\"\n\n\"No--oh no! I mean he may be, but it would be loathsome stuff. His brain\nis filled with the husks of books, culture--horrible; we want him to\nwash out his brain and go to the real thing. We want to show him how\nhe may get upsides with life. As I said, either friends or the country,\nsome\"--she hesitated--\"either some very dear person or some very dear\nplace seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey, and to show that it\nis grey. If possible, one should have both.\"\n\nSome of her words ran past Mr. Wilcox. He let them run past. Others he\ncaught and criticised with admirable lucidity.\n\n\"Your mistake is this, and it is a very common mistake. This young\nbounder has a life of his own. What right have you to conclude it is an\nunsuccessful life, or, as you call it,  grey ?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\n\"One minute. You know nothing about him. He probably has his own\njoys and interests--wife, children, snug little home. That s where we\npractical fellows\" he smiled--\"are more tolerant than you intellectuals.\nWe live and let live, and assume that things are jogging on fairly well\nelsewhere, and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after\nhis own affairs. I quite grant--I look at the faces of the clerks in my\nown office, and observe them to be dull, but I don t know what s going\non beneath. So, by the way, with London. I have heard you rail against\nLondon, Miss Schlegel, and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very\nangry with you. What do you know about London? You only see civilisation\nfrom the outside. I don t say in your case, but in too many cases that\nattitude leads to morbidity, discontent, and Socialism.\"\n\nShe admitted the strength of his position, though it undermined\nimagination. As he spoke, some outposts of poetry and perhaps of\nsympathy fell ruining, and she retreated to what she called her \"second\nline\"--to the special facts of the case.\n\n\"His wife is an old bore,\" she said simply. \"He never came home last\nSaturday night because he wanted to be alone, and she thought he was\nwith us.\"\n\n\"With YOU?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Evie tittered. \"He hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed. He\nneeds outside interests.\"\n\n\"Naughty young man!\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Naughty?\" said Margaret, who hated naughtiness more than sin. \"When\nyou re married Miss Wilcox, won t you want outside interests?\"\n\n\"He has apparently got them,\" put in Mr. Wilcox slyly.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, father.\"\n\n\"He was tramping in Surrey, if you mean that,\" said Margaret, pacing\naway rather crossly.\n\n\"Oh, I dare say!\"\n\n\"Miss Wilcox, he was!\"\n\n\"M--m--m--m!\" from Mr. Wilcox, who thought the episode amusing, if\nrisque. With most ladies he would not have discussed it, but he was\ntrading on Margaret s reputation as an emancipated woman.\n\n\"He said so, and about such a thing he wouldn t lie.\"\n\nThey both began to laugh.\n\n\"That s where I differ from you. Men lie about their positions and\nprospects, but not about a thing of that sort.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Miss Schlegel, excuse me, but I know the type.\"\n\n\"I said before--he isn t a type. He cares about adventures rightly. He s\ncertain that our smug existence isn t all. He s vulgar and hysterical\nand bookish, but don t think that sums him up. There s manhood in him as\nwell. Yes, that s what I m trying to say. He s a real man.\"\n\nAs she spoke their eyes met, and it was as if Mr. Wilcox s defences\nfell. She saw back to the real man in him. Unwittingly she had touched\nhis emotions.\n\nA woman and two men--they had formed the magic triangle of sex, and\nthe male was thrilled to jealousy, in case the female was attracted by\nanother male. Love, say the ascetics, reveals our shameful kinship with\nthe beasts. Be it so: one can bear that; jealousy is the real shame. It\nis jealousy, not love, that connects us with the farmyard intolerably,\nand calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen. Margaret\ncrushed complacency down because she was civilised. Mr. Wilcox,\nuncivilised, continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his\ndefences, and was again presenting a bastion to the world.\n\n\"Miss Schlegel, you re a pair of dear creatures, but you really MUST be\ncareful in this uncharitable world. What does your brother say?\"\n\n\"I forget.\"\n\n\"Surely he has some opinion?\"\n\n\"He laughs, if I remember correctly.\"\n\n\"He s very clever, isn t he?\" said Evie, who had met and detested Tibby\nat Oxford.\n\n\"Yes, pretty well--but I wonder what Helen s doing.\"\n\n\"She is very young to undertake this sort of thing,\" said Mr. Wilcox.\n\nMargaret went out to the landing. She heard no sound, and Mr. Bast s\ntopper was missing from the hall.\n\n\"Helen!\" she called.\n\n\"Yes!\" replied a voice from the library.\n\n\"You in there?\"\n\n\"Yes--he s gone some time.\"\n\nMargaret went to her. \"Why, you re all alone,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes--it s all right, Meg. Poor, poor creature--\"\n\n\"Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later--Mr. W much concerned, and\nslightly titillated.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ve no patience with him. I hate him. Poor dear Mr. Bast! he\nwanted to talk literature, and we would talk business. Such a muddle of\na man, and yet so worth pulling through. I like him extraordinarily.\"\n\n\"Well done,\" said Margaret, kissing her, \"but come into the drawing-room\nnow, and don t talk about him to the Wilcoxes. Make light of the whole\nthing.\"\n\nHelen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their\nvisitor--this hen at all events was fancy-free.\n\n\"He s gone with my blessing,\" she cried, \"and now for puppies.\"\n\nAs they drove away, Mr. Wilcox said to his daughter:\n\n\"I am really concerned at the way those girls go on. They are as clever\nas you make  em, but unpractical--God bless me! One of these days\nthey ll go too far. Girls like that oughtn t to live alone in London.\nUntil they marry, they ought to have some one to look after them. We\nmust look in more often--we re better than no one. You like them, don t\nyou, Evie?\"\n\nEvie replied: \"Helen s right enough, but I can t stand the toothy one.\nAnd I shouldn t have called either of them girls.\"\n\nEvie had grown up handsome. Dark-eyed, with the glow of youth under\nsunburn, built firmly and firm-lipped, she was the best the Wilcoxes\ncould do in the way of feminine beauty. For the present, puppies and\nher father were the only things she loved, but the net of matrimony was\nbeing prepared for her, and a few days later she was attracted to a Mr.\nPercy Cahill, an uncle of Mrs. Charles s, and he was attracted to her.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XVII\n\nThe Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor. When\na move is imminent, furniture becomes ridiculous, and Margaret now\nlay awake at nights wondering where, where on earth they and all\ntheir belongings would be deposited in September next. Chairs, tables,\npictures, books, that had rumbled down to them through the generations,\nmust rumble forward again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to\ngive the final push, and send toppling into the sea. But there were\nall their father s books--they never read them, but they were\ntheir father s, and must be kept. There was the marble-topped\nchiffonier--their mother had set store by it, they could not remember\nwhy. Round every knob and cushion in the house gathered a sentiment\nthat was at times personal, but more often a faint piety to the dead, a\nprolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave.\n\nIt was absurd, if you came to think of it; Helen and Tibby came to think\nof it; Margaret was too busy with the house-agents. The feudal ownership\nof land did bring dignity, whereas the modern ownership of movables\nis reducing us again to a nomadic horde. We are reverting to the\ncivilisation of luggage, and historians of the future will note how the\nmiddle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth,\nand may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty. The\nSchlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of Wickham Place. It\nhad helped to balance their lives, and almost to counsel them. Nor is\ntheir ground-landlord spiritually the richer. He has built flats on\nits site, his motor-cars grow swifter, his exposures of Socialism more\ntrenchant. But he has spilt the precious distillation of the years, and\nno chemistry of his can give it back to society again.\n\nMargaret grew depressed; she was anxious to settle on a house before\nthey left town to pay their annual visit to Mrs. Munt. She enjoyed this\nvisit, and wanted to have her mind at ease for it. Swanage, though dull,\nwas stable, and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air\nand for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north. But London\nthwarted her; in its atmosphere she could not concentrate. London only\nstimulates, it cannot sustain; and Margaret, hurrying over its surface\nfor a house without knowing what sort of a house she wanted, was paying\nfor many a thrilling sensation in the past. She could not even break\nloose from culture, and her time was wasted by concerts which it would\nbe a sin to miss, and invitations which it would never do to refuse. At\nlast she grew desperate; she resolved that she would go nowhere and be\nat home to no one until she found a house, and broke the resolution in\nhalf an hour.\n\nOnce she had humorously lamented that she had never been to Simpson s\nrestaurant in the Strand. Now a note arrived from Miss Wilcox, asking\nher to lunch there. Mr Cahill was coming and the three would have such a\njolly chat, and perhaps end up at the Hippodrome. Margaret had no strong\nregard for Evie, and no desire to meet her fiance, and she was surprised\nthat Helen, who had been far funnier about Simpson s, had not been asked\ninstead. But the invitation touched her by its intimate tone. She\nmust know Evie Wilcox better than she supposed, and declaring that she\n\"simply must,\" she accepted.\n\nBut when she saw Evie at the entrance of the restaurant, staring\nfiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic women, her heart\nfailed her anew. Miss Wilcox had changed perceptibly since her\nengagement. Her voice was gruffer, her manner more downright, and she\nwas inclined to patronise the more foolish virgin. Margaret was silly\nenough to be pained at this. Depressed at her isolation, she saw not\nonly houses and furniture, but the vessel of life itself slipping past\nher, with people like Evie and Mr. Cahill on board.\n\nThere are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us, and one of them came\nto her at Simpson s in the Strand. As she trod the staircase, narrow,\nbut carpeted thickly, as she entered the eating-room, where saddles of\nmutton were being trundled up to expectant clergymen, she had a strong,\nif erroneous, conviction of her own futility, and wished she had never\ncome out of her backwater, where nothing happened except art and\nliterature, and where no one ever got married or succeeded in\nremaining engaged. Then came a little surprise. \"Father might be of the\nparty--yes, father was.\" With a smile of pleasure she moved forward to\ngreet him, and her feeling of loneliness vanished.\n\n\"I thought I d get round if I could,\" said he. \"Evie told me of her\nlittle plan, so I just slipped in and secured a table. Always secure\na table first. Evie, don t pretend you want to sit by your old father,\nbecause you don t. Miss Schlegel, come in my side, out of pity. My\ngoodness, but you look tired! Been worrying round after your young\nclerks?\"\n\n\"No, after houses,\" said Margaret, edging past him into the box. \"I m\nhungry, not tired; I want to eat heaps.\"\n\n\"That s good. What ll you have?\"\n\n\"Fish pie,\" said she, with a glance at the menu.\n\n\"Fish pie! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson s. It s not a bit the\nthing to go for here.\"\n\n\"Go for something for me, then,\" said Margaret, pulling off her gloves.\nHer spirits were rising, and his reference to Leonard Bast had warmed\nher curiously.\n\n\"Saddle of mutton,\" said he after profound reflection; \"and cider to\ndrink. That s the type of thing. I like this place, for a joke, once in\na way. It is so thoroughly Old English. Don t you agree?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Margaret, who didn t. The order was given, the joint rolled\nup, and the carver, under Mr. Wilcox s direction, cut the meat where\nit was succulent, and piled their plates high. Mr. Cahill insisted on\nsirloin, but admitted that he had made a mistake later on. He and\nEvie soon fell into a conversation of the \"No, I didn t; yes, you did\"\n type--conversation which, though fascinating to those who are engaged in\nit, neither desires nor deserves the attention of others.\n\n\"It s a golden rule to tip the carver. Tip everywhere s my motto.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it does make life more human.\"\n\n\"Then the fellows know one again. Especially in the East, if you tip,\nthey remember you from year s end to year s end.\"\n\n\"Have you been in the East?\"\n\n\"Oh, Greece and the Levant. I used to go out for sport and business to\nCyprus; some military society of a sort there. A few piastres, properly\ndistributed, help to keep one s memory green. But you, of course, think\nthis shockingly cynical. How s your discussion society getting on? Any\nnew Utopias lately?\"\n\n\"No, I m house-hunting, Mr. Wilcox, as I ve already told you once. Do\nyou know of any houses?\"\n\n\"Afraid I don t.\"\n\n\"Well, what s the point of being practical if you can t find two\ndistressed females a house? We merely want a small house with large\nrooms, and plenty of them.\"\n\n\"Evie, I like that! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn house-agent for\nher!\"\n\n\"What s that, father?\"\n\n\"I want a new home in September, and some one must find it. I can t.\"\n\n\"Percy, do you know of anything?\"\n\n\"I can t say I do,\" said Mr. Cahill.\n\n\"How like you! You re never any good.\"\n\n\"Never any good. Just listen to her! Never any good. Oh, come!\"\n\n\"Well, you aren t. Miss Schlegel, is he?\"\n\nThe torrent of their love, having splashed these drops at Margaret,\nswept away on its habitual course. She sympathised with it now, for a\nlittle comfort had restored her geniality. Speech and silence pleased\nher equally, and while Mr. Wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about\ncheese, her eyes surveyed the restaurant, and aired its well-calculated\ntributes to the solidity of our past. Though no more Old English than\nthe works of Kipling, it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly\nthat her criticism was lulled, and the guests whom it was nourishing for\nimperial purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson Adams or Tom Jones.\nScraps of their talk jarred oddly on the ear. \"Right you are! I ll cable\nout to Uganda this evening,\" came from the table behind. \"Their Emperor\nwants war; well, let him have it,\" was the opinion of a clergyman. She\nsmiled at such incongruities. \"Next time,\" she said to Mr. Wilcox, \"you\nshall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles s.\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\"\n\n\"No, you d hate it,\" she said, pushing her glass towards him for some\nmore cider. \"It s all proteids and body buildings, and people come up to\nyou and beg your pardon, but you have such a beautiful aura.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"Never heard of an aura? Oh, happy, happy man! I scrub at mine for\nhours. Nor of an astral plane?\"\n\nHe had heard of astral planes, and censured them.\n\n\"Just so. Luckily it was Helen s aura, not mine, and she had to\nchaperone it and do the politenesses. I just sat with my handkerchief in\nmy mouth till the man went.\"\n\n\"Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls. No one s ever asked me\nabout my--what d ye call it? Perhaps I ve not got one.\"\n\n\"You re bound to have one, but it may be such a terrible colour that no\none dares mention it.\"\n\n\"Tell me, though, Miss Schlegel, do you really believe in the\nsupernatural and all that?\"\n\n\"Too difficult a question.\"\n\n\"Why s that? Gruyere or Stilton?\"\n\n\"Gruyere, please.\"\n\n\"Better have Stilton.\"\n\n\"Stilton. Because, though I don t believe in auras, and think\nTheosophy s only a halfway-house--\"\n\n\"--Yet there may be something in it all the same,\" he concluded, with a\nfrown.\n\n\"Not even that. It may be halfway in the wrong direction. I can t\nexplain. I don t believe in all these fads, and yet I don t like saying\nthat I don t believe in them.\"\n\nHe seemed unsatisfied, and said: \"So you wouldn t give me your word that\nyou DON T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it?\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Margaret, surprised that the point was of any importance\nto him. \"Indeed, I will. When I talked about scrubbing my aura, I was\nonly trying to be funny. But why do you want this settled?\"\n\n\"I don t know.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Wilcox, you do know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" \"No, you re not,\" burst from the lovers opposite. Margaret\nwas silent for a moment, and then changed the subject.\n\n\"How s your house?\"\n\n\"Much the same as when you honoured it last week.\"\n\n\"I don t mean Ducie Street. Howards End, of course.\"\n\n\"Why  of course ?\"\n\n\"Can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us? We re nearly demented.\"\n\n\"Let me think. I wish I could help you. But I thought you wanted to be\nin town. One bit of advice: fix your district, then fix your price, and\nthen don t budge. That s how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton. I said\nto myself,  I mean to be exactly here,  and I was, and Oniton s a place\nin a thousand.\"\n\n\"But I do budge. Gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses--cow them with an\neye, and up they come, trembling. Ladies can t. It s the houses that are\nmesmerising me. I ve no control over the saucy things. Houses are alive.\nNo?\"\n\n\"I m out of my depth,\" he said, and added: \"Didn t you talk rather like\nthat to your office boy?\"\n\n\"Did I?--I mean I did, more or less. I talk the same way to every\none--or try to.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. And how much of it do you suppose he understood?\"\n\n\"That s his lookout. I don t believe in suiting my conversation to my\ncompany. One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems\nto do well enough, but it s no more like the real thing than money\nis like food. There s no nourishment in it. You pass it to the lower\nclasses, and they pass it back to you, and this you call  social\nintercourse  or  mutual endeavour,  when it s mutual priggishness if\nit s anything. Our friends at Chelsea don t see this. They say one ought\nto be at all costs intelligible, and sacrifice--\"\n\n\"Lower classes,\" interrupted Mr. Wilcox, as it were thrusting his hand\ninto her speech. \"Well, you do admit that there are rich and poor.\nThat s something.\"\n\nMargaret could not reply. Was he incredibly stupid, or did he understand\nher better than she understood herself?\n\n\"You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in a few years\nthere would be rich and poor again just the same. The hard-working man\nwould come to the top, the wastrel sink to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Every one admits that.\"\n\n\"Your Socialists don t.\"\n\n\"My Socialists do. Yours mayn t; but I strongly suspect yours of being\nnot Socialists, but ninepins, which you have constructed for your own\namusement. I can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite\nso easily.\"\n\nHe would have resented this had she not been a woman. But women may say\nanything--it was one of his holiest beliefs--and he only retorted, with\na gay smile: \"I don t care. You ve made two damaging admissions, and I m\nheartily with you in both.\"\n\nIn time they finished lunch, and Margaret, who had excused herself from\nthe Hippodrome, took her leave. Evie had scarcely addressed her, and she\nsuspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father. He\nand she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more\nintimate acquaintance. It had begun long ago. She had been his wife s\nfriend and, as such, he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a\nmemento. It was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette, and he had\nalways preferred her to Helen--unlike most men. But the advance had been\nastonishing lately. They had done more in a week than in two years, and\nwere really beginning to know each other.\n\nShe did not forget his promise to sample Eustace Miles, and asked him as\nsoon as she could secure Tibby as his chaperon. He came, and partook of\nbody-building dishes with humility.\n\nNext morning the Schlegels left for Swanage. They had not succeeded in\nfinding a new home.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XVIII\n\nAs they were seated at Aunt Juley s breakfast-table at The Bays,\nparrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay, a\nletter came for Margaret and threw her into perturbation. It was from\nMr. Wilcox. It announced an \"important change\" in his plans. Owing to\nEvie s marriage, he had decided to give up his house in Ducie Street,\nand was willing to let it on a yearly tenancy. It was a businesslike\nletter, and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would\nnot do. Also the rent. If they approved, Margaret was to come up AT\nONCE--the words were underlined, as is necessary when dealing with\nwomen--and to go over the house with him. If they disapproved, a wire\nwould oblige, as he should put it into the hands of an agent.\n\nThe letter perturbed, because she was not sure what it meant. If he\nliked her, if he had manoeuvred to get her to Simpson s, might this be a\nmanoeuvre to get her to London, and result in an offer of marriage?\nShe put it to herself as indelicately as possible, in the hope that her\nbrain would cry, \"Rubbish, you re a self-conscious fool!\" But her brain\nonly tingled a little and was silent, and for a time she sat gazing at\nthe mincing waves, and wondering whether the news would seem strange to\nthe others.\n\nAs soon as she began speaking, the sound of her own voice reassured her.\nThere could be nothing in it. The replies also were typical, and in the\nburr of conversation her fears vanished.\n\n\"You needn t go though--\" began her hostess.\n\n\"I needn t, but hadn t I better? It s really getting rather serious. We\nlet chance after chance slip, and the end of it is we shall be bundled\nout bag and baggage into the street. We don t know what we WANT, that s\nthe mischief with us--\"\n\n\"No, we have no real ties,\" said Helen, helping herself to toast.\n\n\"Shan t I go up to town to-day, take the house if it s the least\npossible, and then come down by the afternoon train to-morrow, and start\nenjoying myself. I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this\nbusiness is off my mind.\"\n\n\"But you won t do anything rash, Margaret?\"\n\n\"There s nothing rash to do.\"\n\n\"Who ARE the Wilcoxes?\" said Tibby, a question that sounds silly, but\nwas really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried\nto answer it. \"I don t MANAGE the Wilcoxes; I don t see where they come\nIN.\"\n\n\"No more do I,\" agreed Helen. \"It s funny that we just don t lose sight\nof them. Out of all our hotel acquaintances, Mr. Wilcox is the only one\nwho has stuck. It is now over three years, and we have drifted away from\nfar more interesting people in that time.\"\n\n\"Interesting people don t get one houses.\"\n\n\"Meg, if you start in your honest-English vein, I shall throw the\ntreacle at you.\"\n\n\"It s a better vein than the cosmopolitan,\" said Margaret, getting up.\n\"Now, children, which is it to be? You know the Ducie Street house.\nShall I say yes or shall I say no? Tibby love--which? I m specially\nanxious to pin you both.\"\n\n\"It all depends on what meaning you attach to the word  possible \"\n\n\"It depends on nothing of the sort. Say  yes. \"\n\n\"Say  no. \"\n\nThen Margaret spoke rather seriously. \"I think,\" she said, \"that our\nrace is degenerating. We cannot settle even this little thing; what will\nit be like when we have to settle a big one?\"\n\n\"It will be as easy as eating,\" returned Helen.\n\n\"I was thinking of father. How could he settle to leave Germany as he\ndid, when he had fought for it as a young man, and all his feelings\nand friends were Prussian? How could he break loose with Patriotism and\nbegin aiming at something else? It would have killed me. When he was\nnearly forty he could change countries and ideals--and we, at our age,\ncan t change houses. It s humiliating.\"\n\n\"Your father may have been able to change countries,\" said Mrs. Munt\nwith asperity, \"and that may or may not be a good thing. But he could\nchange houses no better than you can, in fact, much worse. Never shall I\nforget what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" cried Helen. \"I told you so. It is the little things one\nbungles at. The big, real ones are nothing when they come.\"\n\n\"Bungle, my dear! You are too little to recollect--in fact, you weren t\nthere. But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move\nbefore the lease for Wickham Place was signed, and Emily took train with\nbaby--who was Margaret then--and the smaller luggage for London, without\nso much as knowing where her new home would be. Getting away from that\nhouse may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we all went\nthrough getting you into it.\"\n\nHelen, with her mouth full, cried:\n\n\"And that s the man who beat the Austrians, and the Danes, and the\nFrench, and who beat the Germans that were inside himself. And we re\nlike him.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Tibby. \"Remember that I am cosmopolitan,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Helen may be right.\"\n\n\"Of course she s right,\" said Helen.\n\nHelen might be right, but she did not go up to London. Margaret did\nthat. An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries, and one\nmay be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one\naway from the sea and friends. She could not believe that her father had\never felt the same. Her eyes had been troubling her lately, so that she\ncould not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape,\nwhich she had seen but yesterday. At Southampton she \"waved\" to Frieda;\nFrieda was on her way down to join them at Swanage, and Mrs. Munt had\ncalculated that their trains would cross. But Frieda was looking the\nother way, and Margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and\nold-maidish. How like an old maid to fancy that Mr. Wilcox was\ncourting her! She had once visited a spinster--poor, silly, and\nunattractive--whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell\nin love. How Margaret s heart had bled for the deluded thing! How she\nhad lectured, reasoned, and in despair acquiesced! \"I may have been\ndeceived by the curate, my dear, but the young fellow who brings the\nmidday post really is fond of me, and has, as a matter of fact--\" It had\nalways seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age, yet she might\nbe driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity.\n\nMr. Wilcox met her at Waterloo himself. She felt certain that he was\nnot the same as usual; for one thing, he took offence at everything she\nsaid.\n\n\"This is awfully kind of you,\" she began, \"but I m afraid it s not going\nto do. The house has not been built that suits the Schlegel family.\"\n\n\"What! Have you come up determined not to deal?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Not exactly? In that case let s be starting.\"\n\nShe lingered to admire the motor, which was new, and a fairer creature\nthan the vermilion giant that had borne Aunt Juley to her doom three\nyears before.\n\n\"Presumably it s very beautiful,\" she said. \"How do you like it, Crane?\"\n\n\"Come, let s be starting,\" repeated her host. \"How on earth did you know\nthat my chauffeur was called Crane?\"\n\n\"Why, I know Crane; I ve been for a drive with Evie once. I know that\nyou ve got a parlourmaid called Milton. I know all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Evie!\" he echoed in injured tones. \"You won t see her. She s gone out\nwith Cahill. It s no fun, I can tell you, being left so much alone. I ve\ngot my work all day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when I\ncome home in the evening, I tell you, I can t stand the house.\"\n\n\"In my absurd way, I m lonely too,\" Margaret replied. \"It s\nheart-breaking to leave one s old home. I scarcely remember anything\nbefore Wickham Place, and Helen and Tibby were born there. Helen says--\"\n\n\"You, too, feel lonely?\"\n\n\"Horribly. Hullo, Parliament s back!\"\n\nMr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament contemptuously. The more important\nropes of life lay elsewhere. \"Yes, they are talking again,\" said he.\n\"But you were going to say--\"\n\n\"Only some rubbish about furniture. Helen says it alone endures while\nmen and houses perish, and that in the end the world will be a desert of\nchairs and sofas--just imagine it!--rolling through infinity with no one\nto sit upon them.\"\n\n\"Your sister always likes her little joke.\"\n\n\"She says  Yes,  my brother says `No,  to Ducie Street. It s no fun\nhelping us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you.\"\n\n\"You are not as unpractical as you pretend. I shall never believe it.\"\n\nMargaret laughed. But she was--quite as unpractical. She could not\nconcentrate on details. Parliament, the Thames, the irresponsive\nchauffeur, would flash into the field of house-hunting, and all demand\nsome comment or response. It is impossible to see modern life steadily\nand see it whole, and she had chosen to see it whole. Mr. Wilcox saw\nsteadily. He never bothered over the mysterious or the private. The\nThames might run inland from the sea, the chauffeur might conceal all\npassion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin. They knew their own\nbusiness, and he knew his.\n\nYet she liked being with him. He was not a rebuke, but a stimulus, and\nbanished morbidity. Some twenty years her senior, he preserved a gift\nthat she supposed herself to have already lost--not youth s creative\npower, but its self-confidence and optimism. He was so sure that it was\na very pleasant world. His complexion was robust, his hair had receded\nbut not thinned, the thick moustache and the eyes that Helen had\ncompared to brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them, whether they\nwere turned towards the slums or towards the stars. Some day--in the\nmillennium--there may be no need for his type. At present, homage is due\nto it from those who think themselves superior, and who possibly are.\n\n\"At all events you responded to my telegram promptly,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Oh, even I know a good thing when I see it.\"\n\n\"I m glad you don t despise the goods of this world.\"\n\n\"Heavens, no! Only idiots and prigs do that.\"\n\n\"I am glad, very glad,\" he repeated, suddenly softening and turning to\nher, as if the remark had pleased him. \"There is so much cant talked in\nwould-be intellectual circles. I am glad you don t share it. Self-denial\nis all very well as a means of strengthening the character. But I can t\nstand those people who run down comforts. They have usually some axe to\ngrind. Can you?\"\n\n\"Comforts are of two kinds,\" said Margaret, who was keeping herself in\nhand--\"those we can share with others, like fire, weather, or music; and\nthose we can t--food, food, for instance. It depends.\"\n\n\"I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn t like to think that\nyou--\" He bent nearer; the sentence died unfinished. Margaret s head\nturned very stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the\nbeacon in a lighthouse. He did not kiss her, for the hour was half-past\ntwelve, and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham Palace. But\nthe atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to\nexist on her account, and she was surprised that Crane did not realise\nthis, and turn round. Idiot though she might be, surely Mr. Wilcox was\nmore--how should one put it?--more psychological than usual. Always a\ngood judge of character for business purposes, he seemed this afternoon\nto enlarge his field, and to note qualities outside neatness, obedience,\nand decision.\n\n\"I want to go over the whole house,\" she announced when they arrived.\n\"As soon as I get back to Swanage, which will be to-morrow afternoon,\nI ll talk it over once more with Helen and Tibby, and wire you  yes  or\n no. \"\n\n\"Right. The dining-room.\" And they began their survey.\n\nThe dining-room was big, but over-furnished. Chelsea would have moaned\naloud. Mr. Wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince,\nand relent, and refrain, and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and\npluck. After so much self-colour and self-denial, Margaret viewed with\nrelief the sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded wall-paper, amid whose\nfoliage parrots sang. It would never do with her own furniture, but\nthose heavy chairs, that immense sideboard loaded with presentation\nplate, stood up against its pressure like men. The room suggested men,\nand Margaret, keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and\nhunters of the past, saw it as an ancient guest-hall, where the lord sat\nat meat among his thanes. Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that Charles\nhad brought back from the Boer War--fell into position. Such a room\nadmitted loot.\n\n\"Now the entrance-hall.\"\n\nThe entrance-hall was paved.\n\n\"Here we fellows smoke.\"\n\nWe fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather. It was as if a motor-car\nhad spawned. \"Oh, jolly!\" said Margaret, sinking into one of them.\n\n\"You do like it?\" he said, fixing his eyes on her upturned face, and\nsurely betraying an almost intimate note. \"It s all rubbish not making\noneself comfortable. Isn t it?\"\n\n\"Ye--es. Semi-rubbish. Are those Cruikshanks?\"\n\n\"Gillrays. Shall we go on upstairs?\"\n\n\"Does all this furniture come from Howards End?\"\n\n\"The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton.\"\n\n\"Does--However, I m concerned with the house, not the furniture. How big\nis this smoking-room?\"\n\n\"Thirty by fifteen. No, wait a minute. Fifteen and a half.\"\n\n\"Ah, well. Mr. Wilcox, aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with\nwhich we middle classes approach the subject of houses?\"\n\nThey proceeded to the drawing-room. Chelsea managed better here. It was\nsallow and ineffective. One could visualise the ladies withdrawing\nto it, while their lords discussed life s realities below, to the\naccompaniment of cigars. Had Mrs. Wilcox s drawing-room at Howards End\nlooked thus? Just as this thought entered Margaret s brain, Mr. Wilcox\ndid ask her to be his wife, and the knowledge that she had been right so\novercame her that she nearly fainted.\n\nBut the proposal was not to rank among the world s great love scenes.\n\n\"Miss Schlegel\"--his voice was firm--\"I have had you up on false\npretences. I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a\nhouse.\"\n\nMargaret almost answered: \"I know--\"\n\n\"Could you be induced to share my--is it probable--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wilcox!\" she interrupted, taking hold of the piano and averting\nher eyes. \"I see, I see. I will write to you afterwards if I may.\"\n\nHe began to stammer. \"Miss Schlegel--Margaret you don t understand.\"\n\n\"Oh yes! Indeed, yes!\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I am asking you to be my wife.\"\n\nSo deep already was her sympathy, that when he said, \"I am asking you\nto be my wife,\" she made herself give a little start. She must show\nsurprise if he expected it. An immense joy came over her. It was\nindescribable. It had nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled\nthe all-pervading happiness of fine weather. Fine weather is due to the\nsun, but Margaret could think of no central radiance here. She stood in\nhis drawing-room happy, and longing to give happiness. On leaving him\nshe realised that the central radiance had been love.\n\n\"You aren t offended, Miss Schlegel?\"\n\n\"How could I be offended?\"\n\nThere was a moment s pause. He was anxious to get rid of her, and she\nknew it. She had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for\npossessions that money cannot buy. He desired comradeship and affection,\nbut he feared them, and she, who had taught herself only to desire, and\ncould have clothed the struggle with beauty, held back, and hesitated\nwith him.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she continued. \"You will have a letter from me--I am going\nback to Swanage to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, and it s you I thank.\"\n\n\"I may order the motor round, mayn t I?\"\n\n\"That would be most kind.\"\n\n\"I wish I had written. Ought I to have written?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"There s just one question--\"\n\nShe shook her head. He looked a little bewildered as they parted.\n\nThey parted without shaking hands; she had kept the interview, for his\nsake, in tints of the quietest grey. She thrilled with happiness ere\nshe reached her house. Others had loved her in the past, if one apply\nto their brief desires so grave a word, but the others had been\n\"ninnies\"--young men who had nothing to do, old men who could find\nnobody better. And she had often  loved,  too, but only so far as\nthe facts of sex demanded: mere yearnings for the masculine sex to be\ndismissed for what they were worth, with a sigh. Never before had her\npersonality been touched. She was not young or very rich, and it amazed\nher that a man of any standing should take her seriously.  As she sat,\ntrying to do accounts in her empty house, amidst beautiful pictures and\nnoble books, waves of emotion broke, as if a tide of passion was flowing\nthrough the night air. She shook her head, tried to concentrate her\nattention, and failed. In vain did she repeat: \"But I ve been through\nthis sort of thing before.\" She had never been through it; the big\nmachinery, as opposed to the little, had been set in motion, and the\nidea that Mr. Wilcox loved, obsessed her before she came to love him in\nreturn.\n\nShe would come to no decision yet. \"Oh, sir, this is so sudden\"--that\nprudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came. Premonitions\nare not preparation. She must examine more closely her own nature and\nhis; she must talk it over judicially with Helen. It had been a strange\nlove-scene--the central radiance unacknowledged from first to last. She,\nin his place, would have said Ich liebe dich, but perhaps it was not\nhis habit to open the heart. He might have done it if she had pressed\nhim--as a matter of duty, perhaps; England expects every man to open\nhis heart once; but the effort would have jarred him, and never, if\nshe could avoid it, should he lose those defences that he had chosen to\nraise against the world. He must never be bothered with emotional talk,\nor with a display of sympathy. He was an elderly man now, and it would\nbe futile and impudent to correct him.\n\nMrs. Wilcox strayed in and out, ever a welcome ghost; surveying the\nscene, thought Margaret, without one hint of bitterness.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XIX\n\nIf one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the wisest course\nwould be to take him to the final section of the Purbeck Hills, and\nstand him on their summit, a few miles to the east of Corfe. Then system\nafter system of our island would roll together under his feet. Beneath\nhim is the valley of the Frome, and all the wild lands that come tossing\ndown from Dorchester, black and gold, to mirror their gorse in the\nexpanses of Poole. The valley of the Stour is beyond, unaccountable\nstream, dirty at Blandford, pure at Wimborne--the Stour, sliding out of\nfat fields, to marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christ church. The\nvalley of the Avon--invisible, but far to the north the trained eye may\nsee Clearbury Ring that guards it, and the imagination may leap beyond\nthat on to Salisbury Plain itself, and beyond the Plain to all the\nglorious downs of Central England. Nor is Suburbia absent. Bournemouth s\nignoble coast cowers to the right, heralding the pine-trees that mean,\nfor all their beauty, red houses, and the Stock Exchange, and extend to\nthe gates of London itself. So tremendous is the City s trail! But the\ncliffs of Freshwater it shall never touch, and the island will guard the\nIsland s purity till the end of time. Seen from the west the Wight is\nbeautiful beyond all laws of beauty. It is as if a fragment of England\nfloated forward to greet the foreigner--chalk of our chalk, turf of\nour turf, epitome of what will follow. And behind the fragment lies\nSouthampton, hostess to the nations, and Portsmouth, a latent fire, and\nall around it, with double and treble collision of tides, swirls the\nsea. How many villages appear in this view! How many castles! How many\nchurches, vanished or triumphant! How many ships, railways, and roads!\nWhat incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what\nfinal end! The reason fails, like a wave on the Swanage beach; the\nimagination swells, spreads, and deepens, until it becomes geographic\nand encircles England.\n\nSo Frieda Mosebach, now Frau Architect Liesecke, and mother to her\nhusband s baby, was brought up to these heights to be impressed, and,\nafter a prolonged gaze, she said that the hills were more swelling\nhere than in Pomerania, which was true, but did not seem to Mrs. Munt\napposite. Poole Harbour was dry, which led her to praise the absence of\nmuddy foreshore at Friedrich Wilhelms Bad, Rugen, where beech-trees hang\nover the tideless Baltic, and cows may contemplate the brine. Rather\nunhealthy Mrs. Munt thought this would be, water being safer when it\nmoved about.\n\n\"And your English lakes--Vindermere, Grasmere they, then, unhealthy?\"\n\n\"No, Frau Liesecke; but that is because they are fresh water, and\ndifferent. Salt water ought to have tides, and go up and down a great\ndeal, or else it smells. Look, for instance, at an aquarium.\"\n\n\"An aquarium! Oh, MEESIS Munt, you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums\nstink less than salt? Why, then Victor, my brother-in-law, collected\nmany tadpoles--\" \"You are not to say  stink, \" interrupted Helen; \"at\nleast, you may say it, but you must pretend you are being funny while\nyou say it.\"\n\n\"Then  smell.  And the mud of your Pool down there--does it not smell,\nor may I say  stink,  ha, ha?\"\n\n\"There always has been mud in Poole Harbour,\" said Mrs. Munt, with\na slight frown. \"The rivers bring it down, and a most valuable\noyster-fishery depends upon it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" conceded Frieda; and another international incident\nwas closed.\n\n\" Bournemouth is, \" resumed their hostess, quoting a local rhyme to\nwhich she was much attached--\" Bournemouth is, Poole was, and Swanage\nis to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three.  Now,\nFrau Liesecke, I have shown you Bournemouth, and I have shown you Poole,\nso let us walk backward a little, and look down again at Swanage.\"\n\n\"Aunt Juley, wouldn t that be Meg s train?\"\n\nA tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour, and now was bearing\nsouthwards towards them over the black and the gold.\n\n\"Oh, dearest Margaret, I do hope she won t be overtired.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do wonder--I do wonder whether she s taken the house.\"\n\n\"I hope she hasn t been hasty.\"\n\n\"So do I--oh, SO do I.\"\n\n\"Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place?\" Frieda asked.\n\n\"I should think it would. Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud. All\nthose Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way, and I can t\nthink why he doesn t keep on with it. But it s really for Evie that he\nwent there, and now that Evie s going to be married--\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"You ve never seen Miss Wilcox, Frieda. How absurdly matrimonial you\nare!\"\n\n\"But sister to that Paul?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And to that Charles,\" said Mrs. Munt with feeling. \"Oh, Helen, Helen,\nwhat a time that was!\"\n\nHelen laughed. \"Meg and I haven t got such tender hearts. If there s a\nchance of a cheap house, we go for it.\"\n\n\"Now look, Frau Liesecke, at my niece s train. You see, it is coming\ntowards us--coming, coming; and, when it gets to Corfe, it will actually\ngo THROUGH the downs, on which we are standing, so that, if we walk\nover, as I suggested, and look down on Swanage, we shall see it coming\non the other side. Shall we?\"\n\nFrieda assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and\nexchanged the greater view for the lesser. Rather a dull valley lay\nbelow, backed by the slope of the coastward downs. They were looking\nacross the Isle of Purbeck and on to Swanage, soon to be the most\nimportant town of all, and ugliest of the three. Margaret s train\nreappeared as promised, and was greeted with approval by her aunt.\nIt came to a standstill in the middle distance, and there it had been\nplanned that Tibby should meet her, and drive her, and a tea-basket, up\nto join them.\n\n\"You see,\" continued Helen to her cousin, \"the Wilcoxes collect houses\nas your Victor collects tadpoles. They have, one, Ducie Street; two,\nHowards End, where my great rumpus was; three, a country seat in\nShropshire; four, Charles has a house in Hilton; and five, another near\nEpsom; and six, Evie will have a house when she marries, and probably a\npied-a-terre in the country--which makes seven. Oh yes, and Paul a\nhut in Africa makes eight. I wish we could get Howards End. That was\nsomething like a dear little house! Didn t you think so, Aunt Juley?\"\n\n\"I had too much to do, dear, to look at it,\" said Mrs. Munt, with a\ngracious dignity. \"I had everything to settle and explain, and Charles\nWilcox to keep in his place besides. It isn t likely I should remember\nmuch. I just remember having lunch in your bedroom.\"\n\n\"Yes, so do I. But, oh dear, dear, how dreadful it all seems! And in the\nautumn there began that anti-Pauline movement--you, and Frieda, and\nMeg, and Mrs. Wilcox, all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry\nPaul.\"\n\n\"You yet may,\" said Frieda despondently.\n\nHelen shook her head. \"The Great Wilcox Peril will never return. If I m\ncertain of anything it s of that.\"\n\n\"One is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions.\"\n\nThe remark fell damply on the conversation. But Helen slipped her arm\nround her cousin, somehow liking her the better for making it. It was\nnot an original remark, nor had Frieda appropriated it passionately, for\nshe had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind. Yet it betrayed that\ninterest in the universal which the average Teuton possesses and the\naverage Englishman does not. It was, however illogically, the good,\nthe beautiful, the true, as opposed to the respectable, the pretty,\nthe adequate. It was a landscape of Bocklin s beside a landscape of\nLeader s, strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural\nlife. It sharpened idealism, stirred the soul. It may have been a bad\npreparation for what followed.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Aunt Juley, hurrying away from generalities over the\nnarrow summit of the down. \"Stand where I stand, and you will see the\npony-cart coming. I see the pony-cart coming.\"\n\nThey stood and saw the pony-cart coming. Margaret and Tibby were\npresently seen coming in it. Leaving the outskirts of Swanage, it drove\nfor a little through the budding lanes, and then began the ascent.\n\n\"Have you got the house?\" they shouted, long before she could possibly\nhear.\n\nHelen ran down to meet her. The highroad passed over a saddle, and a\ntrack went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down.\n\n\"Have you got the house?\"\n\nMargaret shook her head.\n\n\"Oh, what a nuisance! So we re as we were?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\nShe got out, looking tired.\n\n\"Some mystery,\" said Tibby. \"We are to be enlightened presently.\"\n\nMargaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal\nof marriage from Mr. Wilcox.\n\nHelen was amused. She opened the gate on to the downs so that her\nbrother might lead the pony through. \"It s just like a widower,\" she\nremarked. \"They ve cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one\nof their first wife s friends.\"\n\nMargaret s face flashed despair.\n\n\"That type--\" She broke off with a cry. \"Meg, not anything wrong with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Wait one minute,\" said Margaret, whispering always.\n\n\"But you ve never conceivably--you ve never--\" She pulled herself\ntogether. \"Tibby, hurry up through; I can t hold this gate indefinitely.\nAunt Juley! I say, Aunt Juley, make the tea, will you, and Frieda; we ve\ngot to talk houses, and will come on afterwards.\" And then, turning her\nface to her sister s, she burst into tears.\n\nMargaret was stupefied. She heard herself saying, \"Oh, really--\" She\nfelt herself touched with a hand that trembled.\n\n\"Don t,\" sobbed Helen, \"don t, don t, Meg, don t!\" She seemed incapable\nof saying any other word. Margaret, trembling herself, led her forward\nup the road, till they strayed through another gate on to the down.\n\n\"Don t, don t do such a thing! I tell you not to--don t! I know--don t!\"\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\n\"Panic and emptiness,\" sobbed Helen. \"Don t!\"\n\nThen Margaret thought, \"Helen is a little selfish. I have never behaved\nlike this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying.\" She said:\n\"But we would still see each other very--often, and you--\"\n\n\"It s not a thing like that,\" sobbed Helen. And she broke right away and\nwandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and\ncrying.\n\n\"What s happened to you?\" called Margaret, following through the wind\nthat gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills. \"But it s\nstupid!\" And suddenly stupidity seized her, and the immense landscape\nwas blurred. But Helen turned back.\n\n\"I don t know what s happened to either of us,\" said Margaret, wiping\nher eyes. \"We must both have gone mad.\" Then Helen wiped hers, and they\neven laughed a little.\n\n\"Look here, sit down.\"\n\n\"All right; I ll sit down if you ll sit down.\"\n\n\"There. (One kiss.) Now, whatever, whatever is the matter?\"\n\n\"I do mean what I said. Don t; it wouldn t do.\"\n\n\"Oh, Helen, stop saying  don t ! It s ignorant. It s as if your head\nwasn t out of the slime.  Don t  is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the\nday to Mr. Bast.\"\n\nHelen was silent.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Tell me about it first, and meanwhile perhaps I ll have got my head out\nof the slime.\"\n\n\"That s better. Well, where shall I begin? When I arrived at\nWaterloo--no, I ll go back before that, because I m anxious you should\nknow everything from the first. The  first  was about ten days ago. It\nwas the day Mr. Bast came to tea and lost his temper. I was defending\nhim, and Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me, however slightly. I thought\nit was the involuntary thing, which men can t help any more than we can.\nYou know--at least, I know in my own case--when a man has said to me,\n So-and-so s a pretty girl,  I am seized with a momentary sourness\nagainst So-and-so, and long to tweak her ear. It s a tiresome feeling,\nbut not an important one, and one easily manages it. But it wasn t only\nthis in Mr. Wilcox s case, I gather now.\"\n\n\"Then you love him?\"\n\nMargaret considered. \"It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for\nyou,\" she said. \"The mere fact of that grows more tremendous. Remember,\nI ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years.\"\n\n\"But loved him?\"\n\nMargaret peered into her past. It is pleasant to analyse feelings while\nthey are still only feelings, and unembodied in the social fabric. With\nher arm round Helen, and her eyes shifting over the view, as if this\ncountry or that could reveal the secret of her own heart, she meditated\nhonestly, and said, \"No.\"\n\n\"But you will?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Margaret, \"of that I m pretty sure. Indeed, I began the\nmoment he spoke to me.\"\n\n\"And have settled to marry him?\"\n\n\"I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now. What is it against him,\nHelen? You must try and say.\"\n\nHelen, in her turn, looked outwards. \"It is ever since Paul,\" she said\nfinally.\n\n\"But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul?\"\n\n\"But he was there, they were all there that morning when I came down\nto breakfast, and saw that Paul was frightened--the man who loved me\nfrightened and all his paraphernalia fallen, so that I knew it was\nimpossible, because personal relations are the important thing for ever\nand ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger.\"\n\nShe poured the sentence forth in one breath, but her sister understood\nit, because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them.\n\n\"That s foolish. In the first place, I disagree about the outer life.\nWell, we ve often argued that. The real point is that there is the\nwidest gulf between my love-making and yours. Yours was romance; mine\nwill be prose. I m not running it down--a very good kind of prose, but\nwell considered, well thought out. For instance, I know all Mr. Wilcox s\nfaults. He s afraid of emotion. He cares too much about success, too\nlittle about the past. His sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn t sympathy\nreally. I d even say\"--she looked at the shining lagoons--\"that,\nspiritually, he s not as honest as I am. Doesn t that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn t,\" said Helen. \"It makes me feel worse and worse. You\nmust be mad.\"\n\nMargaret made a movement of irritation.\n\n\"I don t intend him, or any man or any woman, to be all my life--good\nheavens, no! There are heaps of things in me that he doesn t, and shall\nnever, understand.\"\n\nThus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union,\nbefore the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between\nmarried couples and the world. She was to keep her independence more\nthan do most women as yet. Marriage was to alter her fortunes rather\nthan her character, and she was not far wrong in boasting that she\nunderstood her future husband. Yet he did alter her character--a little.\nThere was an unforeseen surprise, a cessation of the winds and odours of\nlife, a social pressure that would have her think conjugally.\n\n\"So with him,\" she continued. \"There are heaps of things in him--more\nespecially things that he does that will always be hidden from me. He\nhas all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all\nthis--\" She waved her hand at the landscape, which confirmed anything.\n\"If Wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in England for thousands of years,\nyou and I couldn t sit here without having our throats cut. There would\nbe no trains, no ships to carry us literary people about in, no fields\neven. Just savagery. No--perhaps not even that. Without their spirit\nlife might never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I refuse\nto draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it. There are times\nwhen it seems to me--\"\n\n\"And to me, and to all women. So one kissed Paul.\"\n\n\"That s brutal,\" said Margaret. \"Mine is an absolutely different case.\nI ve thought things out.\"\n\n\"It makes no difference thinking things out. They come to the same.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\"\n\nThere was a long silence, during which the tide returned into Poole\nHarbour. \"One would lose something,\" murmured Helen, apparently to\nherself. The water crept over the mud-flats towards the gorse and the\nblackened heather. Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores, and\nbecame a sombre episode of trees. Frome was forced inward towards\nDorchester, Stour against Wimborne, Avon towards Salisbury, and over the\nimmense displacement the sun presided, leading it to triumph ere he sank\nto rest. England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying\nfor joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with\ncontrary motion, blew stronger against her rising seas. What did it\nmean? For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her\nsinuous coast? Does she belong to those who have moulded her and made\nher feared by other lands, or to those who have added nothing to her\npower, but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying\nas a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the\nbrave world s fleet accompanying her towards eternity?\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XX\n\nMargaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the\nworld s waters, when Love, who seems so tiny a pebble, slips in. Whom\ndoes Love concern beyond the beloved and the lover? Yet his impact\ndeluges a hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit\nof the generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against\nthe ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand. But\nLove cannot understand this. He cannot comprehend another s infinity; he\nis conscious only of his own--flying sunbeam, falling rose, pebble that\nasks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and\ntime. He knows that he will survive at the end of things, and be\ngathered by Fate as a jewel from the slime, and be handed with\nadmiration round the assembly of the gods. \"Men did produce this\"\n they will say, and, saying, they will give men immortality. But\nmeanwhile--what agitations meanwhile! The foundations of Property and\nPropriety are laid bare, twin rocks; Family Pride flounders to the\nsurface, puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted; Theology,\nvaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty ground swell. Then the lawyers are\naroused--cold brood--and creep out of their holes. They do what they\ncan; they tidy up Property and Propriety, reassure Theology and Family\nPride. Half-guineas are poured on the troubled waters, the lawyers creep\nback, and, if all has gone well, Love joins one man and woman together\nin Matrimony.\n\nMargaret had expected the disturbance, and was not irritated by it.\nFor a sensitive woman she had steady nerves, and could bear with the\nincongruous and the grotesque; and, besides, there was nothing excessive\nabout her love-affair. Good-humour was the dominant note of her\nrelations with Mr. Wilcox, or, as I must now call him, Henry. Henry\ndid not encourage romance, and she was no girl to fidget for it. An\nacquaintance had become a lover, might become a husband, but would\nretain all that she had noted in the acquaintance; and love must confirm\nan old relation rather than reveal a new one.\n\nIn this spirit she promised to marry him.\n\nHe was in Swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring.\n\nThey greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed\nAunt Juley. Henry dined at The Bays, but had engaged a bedroom in the\nprincipal hotel; he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by\ninstinct. After dinner he asked Margaret if she wouldn t care for a turn\non the Parade. She accepted, and could not repress a little tremor; it\nwould be her first real love scene. But as she put on her hat she burst\nout laughing. Love was so unlike the article served up in books; the\njoy, though genuine was different; the mystery an unexpected mystery.\nFor one thing, Mr. Wilcox still seemed a stranger.\n\nFor a time they talked about the ring; then she said: \"Do you remember\nthe Embankment at Chelsea? It can t be ten days ago.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, laughing. \"And you and your sister were head and ears\ndeep in some Quixotic scheme. Ah well!\"\n\n\"I little thought then, certainly. Did you?\"\n\n\"I don t know about that; I shouldn t like to say.\"\n\n\"Why, was it earlier?\" she cried. \"Did you think of me this way earlier!\nHow extraordinarily interesting, Henry! Tell me.\"\n\nBut Henry had no intention of telling. Perhaps he could not have told,\nfor his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through\nthem. He misliked the very word \"interesting,\" connoting it with wasted\nenergy and even with morbidity. Hard facts were enough for him.\n\n\"I didn t think of it,\" she pursued. \"No; when you spoke to me in the\ndrawing-room, that was practically the first. It was all so different\nfrom what it s supposed to be. On the stage, or in books, a proposal\nis--how shall I put it?--a full-blown affair, a kind of bouquet;\nit loses its literal meaning. But in life a proposal really is a\nproposal--\"\n\n\"By the way--\"\n\n\"--a suggestion, a seed,\" she concluded; and the thought flew away\ninto darkness.\n\n\"I was thinking, if you didn t mind, that we ought to spend this evening\nin a business talk; there will be so much to settle.\"\n\n\"I think so too.  Tell me, in the first place, how did you get on with Tibby?\"\n\n\"With your brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, during cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well.\"\n\n\"I am so glad,\" she answered, a little surprised. \"What did you talk\nabout? Me, presumably.\"\n\n\"About Greece too.\"\n\n\"Greece was a very good card, Henry. Tibby s only a boy still, and one\nhas to pick and choose subjects a little. Well done.\"\n\n\"I was telling him I have shares in a currant-farm near Calamata.\"\n\n\"What a delightful thing to have shares in! Can t we go there for our\nhoneymoon?\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"To eat the currants. And isn t there marvellous scenery?\"\n\n\"Moderately, but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to\nwith a lady.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"No hotels.\"\n\n\"Some ladies do without hotels. Are you aware that Helen and I have\nwalked alone over the Apennines, with our luggage on our backs?\"\n\n\"I wasn t aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never do such a thing\nagain.\"\n\nShe said more gravely: \"You haven t found time for a talk with Helen\nyet, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do, before you go. I am so anxious you two should be friends.\"\n\n\"Your sister and I have always hit it off,\" he said negligently. \"But\nwe re drifting away from our business. Let me begin at the beginning.\nYou know that Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill.\"\n\n\"Dolly s uncle.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The girl s madly in love with him. A very good sort of fellow,\nbut he demands--and rightly--a suitable provision with her. And in the\nsecond place you will naturally understand, there is Charles. Before\nleaving town, I wrote Charles a very careful letter. You see, he has\nan increasing family and increasing expenses, and the I. and W. A. is\nnothing particular just now, though capable of development.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" murmured Margaret, looking out to sea, and not\nunderstanding.\n\n\"Charles being the elder son, some day Charles will have Howards End;\nbut I am anxious, in my own happiness, not to be unjust to others.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" she began, and then gave a little cry. \"you mean money.\nHow stupid I am! Of course not!\"\n\nOddly enough, he winced a little at the word. \"Yes, Money, since you put\nit so frankly. I am determined to be just to all--just to you, just to\nthem. I am determined that my children shall have me.\"\n\n\"Be generous to them,\" she said sharply. \"Bother justice!\"\n\n\"I am determined--and have already written to Charles to that effect--\"\n\n\"But how much have you got?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"How much have you a year? I ve six hundred.\"\n\n\"My income?\"\n\n\"Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we can settle how\nmuch you can give Charles. Justice, and even generosity, depend on\nthat.\"\n\n\"I must say you re a downright young woman,\" he observed, patting her\narm and laughing a little. \"What a question to spring on a fellow!\"\n\n\"Don t you know your income? Or don t you want to tell it me?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"That s all right\"--now she patted him--\"don t tell me. I don t want to\nknow. I can do the sum just as well by proportion. Divide your income\ninto ten parts. How many parts would you give to Evie, how many to\nCharles, how many to Paul?\"\n\n\"The fact is, my dear, I hadn t any intention of bothering you with\ndetails. I only wanted to let you know that--well, that something must\nbe done for the others, and you ve understood me perfectly, so let s\npass on to the next point.\"\n\n\"Yes, we ve settled that,\" said Margaret, undisturbed by his strategic\nblunderings. \"Go ahead; give away all you can, bearing in mind that I ve\na clear six hundred. What a mercy it is to have all this money about\none.\"\n\n\"We ve none too much, I assure you; you re marrying a poor man.\"\n\n\"Helen wouldn t agree with me here,\" she continued. \"Helen daren t slang\nthe rich, being rich herself, but she would like to. There s an odd\nnotion, that I haven t yet got hold of, running about at the back of her\nbrain, that poverty is somehow  real.  She dislikes all organisation,\nand probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth. Sovereigns in\na stocking wouldn t bother her; cheques do. Helen is too relentless. One\ncan t deal in her high-handed manner with the world.\"\n\n\"There s this other point, and then I must go back to my hotel and write\nsome letters. What s to be done now about the house in Ducie Street?\"\n\n\"Keep it on--at least, it depends. When do you want to marry me?\"\n\nShe raised her voice, as too often, and some youths, who were also\ntaking the evening air, overheard her. \"Getting a bit hot, eh?\" said\none. Mr. Wilcox turned on them, and said sharply, \"I say!\" There was\nsilence. \"Take care I don t report you to the police.\" They moved away\nquietly enough, but were only biding their time, and the rest of the\nconversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter.\n\nLowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it, he said:\n\"Evie will probably be married in September. We could scarcely think of\nanything before then.\"\n\n\"The earlier the nicer, Henry. Females are not supposed to say such\nthings, but the earlier the nicer.\"\n\n\"How about September for us too?\" he asked, rather dryly.\n\n\"Right. Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September? Or shall\nwe try to bounce Helen and Tibby into it? That s rather an idea. They\nare so unbusinesslike, we could make them do anything by judicious\nmanagement. Look here--yes. We ll do that. And we ourselves could live\nat Howards End or Shropshire.\"\n\nHe blew out his cheeks. \"Heavens! how you women do fly round! My head s\nin a whirl. Point by point, Margaret. Howards End s impossible. I let\nit to Hamar Bryce on a three years  agreement last March. Don t you\nremember? Oniton. Well, that is much, much too far away to rely on\nentirely. You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain\namount, but we must have a house within easy reach of Town. Only Ducie\nStreet has huge drawbacks. There s a mews behind.\"\n\nMargaret could not help laughing. It was the first she had heard of\nthe mews behind Ducie Street. When she was a possible tenant it had\nsuppressed itself, not consciously, but automatically. The breezy\nWilcox manner, though genuine, lacked the clearness of vision that is\nimperative for truth. When Henry lived in Ducie Street he remembered\nthe mews; when he tried to let he forgot it; and if any one had remarked\nthat the mews must be either there or not, he would have felt annoyed,\nand afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatising the speaker\nas academic. So does my grocer stigmatise me when I complain of the\nquality of his sultanas, and he answers in one breath that they are the\nbest sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price? It\nis a flaw inherent in the business mind, and Margaret may do well to\nbe tender to it, considering all that the business mind has done for\nEngland.\n\n\"Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a serious nuisance. The\nsmoking-room, too, is an abominable little den. The house opposite\nhas been taken by operatic people. Ducie Street s going down, it s my\nprivate opinion.\"\n\n\"How sad! It s only a few years since they built those pretty houses.\"\n\n\"Shows things are moving. Good for trade.\"\n\n\"I hate this continual flux of London. It is an epitome of us at\nour worst--eternal formlessness; all the qualities, good, bad, and\nindifferent, streaming away--streaming, streaming for ever. That s why I\ndread it so. I mistrust rivers, even in scenery. Now, the sea--\"\n\n\"High tide, yes.\"\n\n\"Hoy toid\"--from the promenading youths.\n\n\"And these are the men to whom we give the vote,\" observed Mr. Wilcox,\nomitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as\nclerks--work that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men.\n\"However, they have their own lives and interests. Let s get on.\"\n\nHe turned as he spoke, and prepared to see her back to The Bays. The\nbusiness was over. His hotel was in the opposite direction, and if he\naccompanied her his letters would be late for the post. She implored him\nnot to come, but he was obdurate.\n\n\"A nice beginning, if your aunt saw you slip in alone!\"\n\n\"But I always do go about alone. Considering I ve walked over the\nApennines, it s common sense. You will make me so angry. I don t the\nleast take it as a compliment.\"\n\nHe laughed, and lit a cigar. \"It isn t meant as a compliment, my dear. I\njust won t have you going about in the dark. Such people about too! It s\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"Can t I look after myself? I do wish--\"\n\n\"Come along, Margaret; no wheedling.\"\n\nA younger woman might have resented his masterly ways, but Margaret\nhad too firm a grip of life to make a fuss. She was, in her own way, as\nmasterly. If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak, whom all might\ntread, but whom the snows made nightly virginal. Disdaining the heroic\noutfit, excitable in her methods, garrulous, episodical, shrill,\nshe misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt. He mistook her\nfertility for Weakness. He supposed her \"as clever as they make them,\"\n but no more, not realising that she was penetrating to the depths of his\nsoul, and approving of what she found there.\n\nAnd if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of\nlife, their happiness had been assured.\n\nThey walked ahead briskly. The parade and the road after it were well\nlighted, but it was darker in Aunt Juley s garden. As they were going\nup by the side-paths, through some rhododendrons, Mr. Wilcox, who was\nin front, said \"Margaret\" rather huskily, turned, dropped his cigar, and\ntook her in his arms.\n\nShe was startled, and nearly screamed, but recovered herself at once,\nand kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own.\nIt was their first kiss, and when it was over he saw her safely to the\ndoor and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the\nmaid answered it. On looking back, the incident displeased her. It was\nso isolated. Nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it,\nand, worse still, no tenderness had ensued. If a man cannot lead up to\npassion he can at all events lead down from it, and she had hoped,\nafter her complaisance, for some interchange of gentle words. But he had\nhurried away as if ashamed, and for an instant she was reminded of Helen\nand Paul.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXII\n\nMargaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow. Mature\nas he was, she might yet be able to help him to the building of the\nrainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion.\nWithout it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts,\nunconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is\nborn, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the grey, sober\nagainst the fire. Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of\nthese outspread wings. The roads of his soul lie clear, and he and his\nfriends shall find easy-going.\n\nIt was hard-going in the roads of Mr. Wilcox s soul. From boyhood he\nhad neglected them. \"I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside.\"\n Outwardly he was cheerful, reliable, and brave; but within, all\nhad reverted to chaos, ruled, so far as it was ruled at all, by an\nincomplete asceticism. Whether as boy, husband, or widower, he had\nalways the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad, a belief that is\ndesirable only when held passionately. Religion had confirmed him. The\nwords that were read aloud on Sunday to him and to other respectable men\nwere the words that had once kindled the souls of St. Catherine and St.\nFrancis into a white-hot hatred of the carnal. He could not be as the\nsaints and love the Infinite with a seraphic ardour, but he could be a\nlittle ashamed of loving a wife. Amabat, amare timebat. And it was here\nthat Margaret hoped to help him.\n\nIt did not seem so difficult. She need trouble him with no gift of her\nown. She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own\nsoul, and in the soul of every man. Only connect! That was the whole\nof her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be\nexalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no\nlonger. Only connect and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation\nthat is life to either, will die.\n\nNor was the message difficult to give. It need not take the form of a\ngood \"talking.\" By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span\ntheir lives with beauty.\n\nBut she failed. For there was one quality in Henry for which she was\nnever prepared, however much she reminded herself of it: his obtuseness.\nHe simply did not notice things, and there was no more to be said. He\nnever noticed that Helen and Frieda were hostile, or that Tibby was\nnot interested in currant plantations; he never noticed the lights and\nshades that exist in the greyest conversation, the finger-posts, the\nmilestones, the collisions, the illimitable views. Once--on another\noccasion--she scolded him about it. He was puzzled, but replied with a\nlaugh: \"My motto is Concentrate. I ve no intention of frittering away\nmy strength on that sort of thing.\" \"It isn t frittering away the\nstrength,\" she protested. \"It s enlarging the space in which you may\nbe strong.\" He answered: \"You re a clever little woman, but my motto s\nConcentrate.\" And this morning he concentrated with a vengeance.\n\nThey met in the rhododendrons of yesterday. In the daylight the bushes\nwere inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun. She was\nwith Helen, who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled.\n\"Here we all are!\" she cried, and took him by one hand, retaining her\nsister s in the other.\n\n\"Here we are. Good-morning, Helen.\"\n\nHelen replied, \"Good-morning, Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"Henry, she has had such a nice letter from the queer, cross boy. Do\nyou remember him? He had a sad moustache, but the back of his head was\nyoung.\"\n\n\"I have had a letter too. Not a nice one--I want to talk it over with\nyou\"; for Leonard Bast was nothing to him now that she had given him her\nword; the triangle of sex was broken for ever.\n\n\"Thanks to your hint, he s clearing out of the Porphyrion.\"\n\n\"Not a bad business that Porphyrion,\" he said absently, as he took his\nown letter out of his pocket.\n\n\"Not a BAD--\" she exclaimed, dropping his hand. \"Surely, on Chelsea\nEmbankment--\"\n\n\"Here s our hostess. Good-morning, Mrs. Munt. Fine rhododendrons.\nGood-morning, Frau Liesecke; we manage to grow flowers in England, don t\nwe?\"\n\n\"Not a BAD business?\"\n\n\"No. My letter s about Howards End. Bryce has been ordered abroad, and\nwants to sublet it--I am far from sure that I shall give him permission.\nThere was no clause in the agreement. In my opinion, subletting is a\nmistake. If he can find me another tenant, whom I consider suitable,\nI may cancel the agreement. Morning, Schlegel. Don t you think that s\nbetter than subletting?\"\n\nHelen had dropped her hand now, and he had steered her past the whole\nparty to the seaward side of the house. Beneath them was the bourgeois\nlittle bay, which must have yearned all through the centuries for just\nsuch a watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin.\n\nThe waves were colourless, and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further\ntouch of insipidity, drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for\nexcursionists.\n\n\"When there is a sublet I find that damage--\"\n\n\"Do excuse me, but about the Porphyrion. I don t feel easy--might I just\nbother you, Henry?\"\n\nHer manner was so serious that he stopped, and asked her a little\nsharply what she wanted.\n\n\"You said on Chelsea Embankment, surely, that it was a bad concern, so\nwe advised this clerk to clear out. He writes this morning that he s\ntaken our advice, and now you say it s not a bad concern.\"\n\n\"A clerk who clears out of any concern, good or bad, without securing a\nberth somewhere else first, is a fool, and I ve no pity for him.\"\n\n\"He has not done that. He s going into a bank in Camden Town, he says.\nThe salary s much lower, but he hopes to manage--a branch of Dempster s\nBank. Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Dempster! Why goodness me, yes.\"\n\n\"More right than the Porphyrion?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes; safe as houses--safer.\"\n\n\"Very many thanks. I m sorry--if you sublet--?\"\n\n\"If he sublets, I shan t have the same control. In theory there should\nbe no more damage done at Howards End; in practice there will be. Things\nmay be done for which no money can compensate. For instance, I shouldn t\nwant that fine wych-elm spoilt. It hangs--Margaret, we must go and see\nthe old place some time. It s pretty in its way. We ll motor down and\nhave lunch with Charles.\"\n\n\"I should enjoy that,\" said Margaret bravely.\n\n\"What about next Wednesday?\"\n\n\"Wednesday? No, I couldn t well do that. Aunt Juley expects us to stop\nhere another week at least.\"\n\n\"But you can give that up now.\"\n\n\"Er--no,\" said Margaret, after a moment s thought.\n\n\"Oh, that ll be all right. I ll speak to her.\"\n\n\"This visit is a high solemnity. My aunt counts on it year after\nyear. She turns the house upside down for us; she invites our special\nfriends--she scarcely knows Frieda, and we can t leave her on her hands.\nI missed one day, and she would be so hurt if I didn t stay the full\nten.\"\n\n\"But I ll say a word to her. Don t you bother.\"\n\n\"Henry, I won t go. Don t bully me.\"\n\n\"You want to see the house, though?\"\n\n\"Very much--I ve heard so much about it, one way or the other. Aren t\nthere pigs  teeth in the wych-elm?\"\n\n\"PIGS TEETH?\"\n\n\"And you chew the bark for toothache.\"\n\n\"What a rum notion! Of course not!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree. There are still a\ngreat number of sacred trees in England, it seems.\"\n\nBut he left her to intercept Mrs. Munt, whose voice could be heard in\nthe distance; to be intercepted himself by Helen.\n\n\"Oh. Mr. Wilcox, about the Porphyrion--\" she began and went scarlet all\nover her face.\n\n\"It s all right,\" called Margaret, catching them up. \"Dempster s Bank s\nbetter.\"\n\n\"But I think you told us the Porphyrion was bad, and would smash before\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"Did I? It was still outside the Tariff Ring, and had to take rotten\npolicies. Lately it came in--safe as houses now.\"\n\n\"In other words, Mr. Bast need never have left it.\"\n\n\"No, the fellow needn t.\"\n\n\"--and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary.\"\n\n\"He only says  reduced, \" corrected Margaret, seeing trouble ahead.\n\n\"With a man so poor, every reduction must be great. I consider it a\ndeplorable misfortune.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox, intent on his business with Mrs. Munt, was going steadily\non, but the last remark made him say: \"What? What s that? Do you mean\nthat I m responsible?\"\n\n\"You re ridiculous, Helen.\"\n\n\"You seem to think--\" He looked at his watch. \"Let me explain the point\nto you. It is like this. You seem to assume, when a business concern is\nconducting a delicate negotiation, it ought to keep the public informed\nstage by stage. The Porphyrion, according to you, was bound to say,  I\nam trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring. I am not sure that\nI shall succeed, but it is the only thing that will save me from\ninsolvency, and I am trying.  My dear Helen--\"\n\n\"Is that your point? A man who had little money has less--that s mine.\"\n\n\"I am grieved for your clerk. But it is all in the day s work. It s part\nof the battle of life.\"\n\n\"A man who had little money--\" she repeated, \"has less, owing to\nus. Under these circumstances I consider  the battle of life  a happy\nexpression.\"\n\n\"Oh come, come!\" he protested pleasantly, \"you re not to blame. No one s\nto blame.\"\n\n\"Is no one to blame for anything?\"\n\n\"I wouldn t say that, but you re taking it far too seriously. Who is\nthis fellow?\"\n\n\"We have told you about the fellow twice already,\" said Helen. \"You\nhave even met the fellow. He is very poor and his wife is an\nextravagant imbecile. He is capable of better things. We--we, the upper\nclasses--thought we would help him from the height of our superior\nknowledge--and here s the result!\"\n\nHe raised his finger. \"Now, a word of advice.\"\n\n\"I require no more advice.\"\n\n\"A word of advice. Don t take up that sentimental attitude over the\npoor. See that she doesn t, Margaret. The poor are poor, and one s sorry\nfor them, but there it is. As civilisation moves forward, the shoe is\nbound to pinch in places, and it s absurd to pretend that any one is\nresponsible personally. Neither you, nor I, nor my informant, nor the\nman who informed him, nor the directors of the Porphyrion, are to blame\nfor this clerk s loss of salary. It s just the shoe pinching--no one can\nhelp it; and it might easily have been worse.\"\n\nHelen quivered with indignation.\n\n\"By all means subscribe to charities--subscribe to them largely--but\ndon t get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform. I see a good\ndeal behind the scenes, and you can take it from me that there is no\nSocial Question--except for a few journalists who try to get a living\nout of the phrase. There are just rich and poor, as there always have\nbeen and always will be. Point me out a time when men have been equal--\"\n\n\"I didn t say--\"\n\n\"Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier. No,\nno. You can t. There always have been rich and poor. I m no fatalist.\nHeaven forbid! But our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal\nforces\" (his voice grew complacent; it always did when he eliminated the\npersonal), \"and there always will be rich and poor. You can t deny it\"\n (and now it was a respectful voice)--\"and you can t deny that, in spite\nof all, the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward.\"\n\n\"Owing to God, I suppose,\" flashed Helen.\n\nHe stared at her.\n\n\"You grab the dollars. God does the rest.\"\n\nIt was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about God\nin that neurotic modern way. Fraternal to the last, he left her for\nthe quieter company of Mrs. Munt. He thought, \"She rather reminds me of\nDolly.\"\n\nHelen looked out at the sea.\n\n\"Don t ever discuss political economy with Henry,\" advised her sister.\n\"It ll only end in a cry.\"\n\n\"But he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with\nreligion,\" said Helen slowly. \"I don t like those men. They are\nscientific themselves, and talk of the survival of the fittest, and cut\ndown the salaries of their clerks, and stunt the independence of all who\nmay menace their comfort, but yet they believe that somehow good--it\nis always that sloppy  somehow  will be the outcome, and that in some\nmystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the Mr.\nBrits of today are in pain.\"\n\n\"He is such a man in theory. But oh, Helen, in theory!\"\n\n\"But oh, Meg, what a theory!\"\n\n\"Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?\"\n\n\"Because I m an old maid,\" said Helen, biting her lip. \"I can t think\nwhy I go on like this myself.\" She shook off her sister s hand and went\ninto the house. Margaret, distressed at the day s beginning, followed\nthe Bournemouth steamer with her eyes. She saw that Helen s nerves\nwere exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the bounds of\npoliteness. There might at any minute be a real explosion, which even\nHenry would notice. Henry must be removed.\n\n\"Margaret!\" her aunt called. \"Magsy! It isn t true, surely, what Mr.\nWilcox says, that you want to go away early next week?\"\n\n\"Not  want, \" was Margaret s prompt reply; \"but there is so much to be\nsettled, and I do want to see the Charles s.\"\n\n\"But going away without taking the Weymouth trip, or even the Lulworth?\"\n said Mrs. Munt, coming nearer. \"Without going once more up Nine Barrows\nDown?\"\n\n\"I m afraid so.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox rejoined her with, \"Good! I did the breaking of the ice.\"\n\nA wave of tenderness came over her. She put a hand on either shoulder,\nand looked deeply into the black, bright eyes. What was behind their\ncompetent stare? She knew, but was not disquieted.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIII\n\nMargaret had no intention of letting things slide, and the evening\nbefore she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding. She\ncensured her, not for disapproving of the engagement, but for throwing\nover her disapproval a veil of mystery. Helen was equally frank. \"Yes,\"\n she said, with the air of one looking inwards, \"there is a mystery.\nI can t help it. It s not my fault. It s the way life has been made.\"\n Helen in those days was over-interested in the subconscious self. She\nexaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as\npuppets, whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war. Margaret\npointed out that if she dwelt on this she, too, would eliminate the\npersonal. Helen was silent for a minute, and then burst into a queer\nspeech, which cleared the air. \"Go on and marry him. I think you re\nsplendid; and if any one can pull it off, you will.\" Margaret denied\nthat there was anything to \"pull off,\" but she continued: \"Yes, there\nis, and I wasn t up to it with Paul. I can do only what s easy. I\ncan only entice and be enticed. I can t, and won t, attempt difficult\nrelations. If I marry, it will either be a man who s strong enough to\nboss me or whom I m strong enough to boss. So I shan t ever marry, for\nthere aren t such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I\nshall certainly run away from him before you can say  Jack Robinson. \nThere! Because I m uneducated. But you, you re different; you re a\nheroine.\"\n\n\"Oh, Helen! Am I? Will it be as dreadful for poor Henry as all that?\"\n\n\"You mean to keep proportion, and that s heroic, it s Greek, and I don t\nsee why it shouldn t succeed with you. Go on and fight with him and help\nhim. Don t ask me for help, or even for sympathy. Henceforward I m going\nmy own way. I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy. I\nmean to dislike your husband, and to tell him so. I mean to make no\nconcessions to Tibby. If Tibby wants to live with me, he must lump me.\nI mean to love you more than ever. Yes, I do. You and I have built\nup something real, because it is purely spiritual. There s no veil of\nmystery over us. Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the\nbody. The popular view is, as usual, exactly the wrong one. Our bothers\nare over tangible things--money, husbands, house-hunting. But Heaven\nwill work of itself.\"\n\nMargaret was grateful for this expression of affection, and answered,\n\"Perhaps.\" All vistas close in the unseen--no one doubts it--but Helen\nclosed them rather too quickly for her taste. At every turn of speech\none was confronted with reality and the absolute. Perhaps Margaret grew\ntoo old for metaphysics, perhaps Henry was weaning her from them, but\nshe felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that\nso readily shreds the visible. The business man who assumes that this\nlife is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail,\non this side and on that, to hit the truth. \"Yes, I see, dear; it s\nabout half-way between,\" Aunt Juley had hazarded in earlier years. No;\ntruth, being alive, was not half-way between anything. It was only to be\nfound by continuous excursions into either realm, and though proportion\nis the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.\n\nHelen, agreeing here, disagreeing there, would have talked till\nmidnight, but Margaret, with her packing to do, focussed the\nconversation on Henry. She might abuse Henry behind his back, but please\nwould she always be civil to him in company? \"I definitely dislike\nhim, but I ll do what I can,\" promised Helen. \"Do what you can with my\nfriends in return.\"\n\nThis conversation made Margaret easier. Their inner life was so safe\nthat they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been\nincredible to Aunt Juley, and impossible for Tibby or Charles. There\nare moments when the inner life actually \"pays,\" when years of\nself-scrutiny, conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of\npractical use. Such moments are still rare in the West; that they come\nat all promises a fairer future. Margaret, though unable to understand\nher sister, was assured against estrangement, and returned to London\nwith a more peaceful mind.\n\nThe following morning, at eleven o clock, she presented herself at the\noffices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company. She was glad to\ngo there, for Henry had implied his business rather than described\nit, and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa\nitself had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth.\nNot that a visit to the office cleared things up. There was just the\nordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars\nthat began and stopped for no possible reason, of electric-light globes\nblossoming in triplets, of little rabbit-hutches faced with glass or\nwire, of little rabbits. And even when she penetrated to the inner\ndepths, she found only the ordinary table and Turkey carpet, and though\nthe map over the fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa, it was\na very ordinary map. Another map hung opposite, on which the whole\ncontinent appeared, looking like a whale marked out for a blubber,\nand by its side was a door, shut, but Henry s voice came through it,\ndictating a \"strong\" letter. She might have been at the Porphyrion, or\nDempster s Bank, or her own wine-merchant s. Everything seems just\nalike in these days. But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial side of the\ncompany rather than its West African, and Imperialism always had been\none of her difficulties.\n\n\"One minute!\" called Mr. Wilcox on receiving her name. He touched a\nbell, the effect of which was to produce Charles.\n\nCharles had written his father an adequate letter--more adequate than\nEvie s, through which a girlish indignation throbbed. And he greeted his\nfuture stepmother with propriety.\n\n\"I hope that my wife--how do you do?--will give you a decent lunch,\" was\nhis opening. \"I left instructions, but we live in a rough-and-ready way.\nShe expects you back to tea, too, after you have had a look at Howards\nEnd. I wonder what you ll think of the place. I wouldn t touch it with\ntongs myself. Do sit down! It s a measly little place.\"\n\n\"I shall enjoy seeing it,\" said Margaret, feeling, for the first time,\nshy.\n\n\"You ll see it at its worst, for Bryce decamped abroad last Monday\nwithout even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him. I never\nsaw such a disgraceful mess. It s unbelievable. He wasn t in the house a\nmonth.\"\n\n\"I ve more than a little bone to pick with Bryce,\" called Henry from the\ninner chamber.\n\n\"Why did he go so suddenly?\"\n\n\"Invalid type; couldn t sleep.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Poor fiddlesticks!\" said Mr. Wilcox, joining them. \"He had the\nimpudence to put up notice-boards without as much as saying with your\nleave or by your leave. Charles flung them down.\"\n\n\"Yes, I flung them down,\" said Charles modestly.\n\n\"I ve sent a telegram after him, and a pretty sharp one, too. He, and\nhe in person, is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next\nthree years.\"\n\n\"The keys are at the farm; we wouldn t have the keys.\"\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\n\"Dolly would have taken them, but I was in, fortunately.\"\n\n\"What s Mr. Bryce like?\" asked Margaret.\n\nBut nobody cared. Mr. Bryce was the tenant, who had no right to sublet;\nto have defined him further was a waste of time. On his misdeeds they\ndescanted profusely, until the girl who had been typing the strong\nletter came out with it. Mr. Wilcox added his signature. \"Now we ll be\noff,\" said he.\n\nA motor-drive, a form of felicity detested by Margaret, awaited her.\nCharles saw them in, civil to the last, and in a moment the offices of\nthe Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away. But it was not\nan impressive drive. Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey\nand banked high with weary clouds. Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely\nintended for motorists. Did not a gentleman once motor so quickly\nthrough Westmoreland that he missed it? and if Westmoreland can\nbe missed, it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure\nparticularly needs the attentive eye. Hertfordshire is England at\nits quietest, with little emphasis of river and hill; it is England\nmeditative. If Drayton were with us again to write a new edition of\nhis incomparable poem, he would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire as\nindeterminate of feature, with hair obfuscated by the London smoke.\nTheir eyes would be sad, and averted from their fate towards the\nNorthern flats, their leader not Isis or Sabrina, but the slowly flowing\nLea. No glory of raiment would be theirs, no urgency of dance; but they\nwould be real nymphs.\n\nThe chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped, for the Great\nNorth Road was full of Easter traffic. But he went quite quick enough\nfor Margaret, a poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on\nthe brain.\n\n\"They re all right,\" said Mr. Wilcox. \"They ll learn--like the swallows\nand the telegraph-wires.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, while they re learning--\"\n\n\"The motor s come to stay,\" he answered. \"One must get about. There s a\npretty church--oh, you aren t sharp enough. Well, look out, if the road\nworries you--right outward at the scenery.\"\n\nShe looked at the scenery. It heaved and merged like porridge. Presently\nit congealed. They had arrived.\n\nCharles s house on the left; on the right the swelling forms of the\nSix Hills. Their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her. They\ninterrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards\nHilton. Beyond them she saw meadows and a wood, and beneath them she\nsettled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried. She hated war and\nliked soldiers--it was one of her amiable inconsistencies.\n\nBut here was Dolly, dressed up to the nines, standing at the door to\ngreet them, and here were the first drops of the rain. They ran in\ngaily, and after a long wait in the drawing-room, sat down to the\nrough-and-ready lunch, every dish of which concealed or exuded cream.\nMr. Bryce was the chief topic of conversation. Dolly described his visit\nwith the key, while her father-in-law gave satisfaction by chaffing her\nand contradicting all she said. It was evidently the custom to laugh\nat Dolly. He chaffed Margaret too, and Margaret roused from a grave\nmeditation was pleased and chaffed him back. Dolly seemed surprised and\neyed her curiously. After lunch the two children came down. Margaret\ndisliked babies, but hit it off better with the two-year-old, and sent\nDolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him. \"Kiss them now, and\ncome away,\" said Mr. Wilcox. She came, but refused to kiss them; it\nwas such hard luck on the little things, she said, and though Dolly\nproffered Chorly-worly and Porgly-woggles in turn, she was obdurate.\n\nBy this time it was raining steadily. The car came round with the\nhood up, and again she lost all sense of space. In a few minutes they\nstopped, and Crane opened the door of the car.\n\n\"What s happened?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"What do you suppose?\" said Henry.\n\nA little porch was close up against her face.\n\n\"Are we there already?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Well, I never! In years ago it seemed so far away.\"\n\nSmiling, but somehow disillusioned, she jumped out, and her impetus\ncarried her to the front-door. She was about to open it, when Henry\nsaid: \"That s no good; it s locked. Who s got the key?\"\n\nAs he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm, no one\nreplied. He also wanted to know who had left the front gate open, since\na cow had strayed in from the road, and was spoiling the croquet lawn.\nThen he said rather crossly: \"Margaret, you wait in the dry. I ll go\ndown for the key. It isn t a hundred yards.\"\n\n\"Mayn t I come too?\"\n\n\"No; I shall be back before I m gone.\"\n\nThen the car turned away, and it was as if a curtain had risen. For the\nsecond time that day she saw the appearance of the earth.\n\nThere were the greengage-trees that Helen had once described, there the\ntennis lawn, there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in\nJune, but the vision now was of black and palest green. Down by the\ndell-hole more vivid colours were awakening, and Lent lilies stood\nsentinel on its margin, or advanced in battalions over the grass. Tulips\nwere a tray of jewels. She could not see the wych-elm tree, but a branch\nof the celebrated vine, studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch.\nShe was struck by the fertility of the soil; she had seldom been in a\ngarden where the flowers looked so well, and even the weeds she was idly\nplucking out of the porch were intensely green. Why had poor Mr. Bryce\nfled from all this beauty? For she had already decided that the place\nwas beautiful.\n\n\"Naughty cow! Go away!\" cried Margaret to the cow, but without\nindignation.\n\nHarder came the rain, pouring out of a windless sky, and spattering up\nfrom the notice-boards of the house-agents, which lay in a row on the\nlawn where Charles had hurled them. She must have interviewed Charles in\nanother world--where one did have interviews. How Helen would revel in\nsuch a notion! Charles dead, all people dead, nothing alive but houses\nand gardens. The obvious dead, the intangible alive, and no connection\nat all between them! Margaret smiled. Would that her own fancies were\nas clear-cut! Would that she could deal as high-handedly with the world!\nSmiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the door. It opened. The\nhouse was not locked up at all.\n\nShe hesitated. Ought she to wait for Henry? He felt strongly about\nproperty, and might prefer to show her over himself. On the other hand,\nhe had told her to keep in the dry, and the porch was beginning to drip.\nSo she went in, and the draught from inside slammed the door behind.\n\nDesolation greeted her. Dirty finger-prints were on the hall-windows,\nflue and rubbish on its unwashed boards. The civilisation of luggage\nhad been here for a month, and then decamped. Dining-room and\ndrawing-room--right and left--were guessed only by their wallpapers.\nThey were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain. Across the\nceiling of each ran a great beam. The dining-room and hall revealed\ntheirs openly, but the drawing-room s was match-boarded--because the\nfacts of life must be concealed from ladies? Drawing-room, dining-room,\nand hall--how petty the names sounded! Here were simply three rooms\nwhere children could play and friends shelter from the rain. Yes, and\nthey were beautiful.\n\nThen she opened one of the doors opposite--there were two--and exchanged\nwall-papers for whitewash. It was the servants  part, though she\nscarcely realised that: just rooms again, where friends might shelter.\nThe garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums. Farther\non were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines. Yes, the meadow\nwas beautiful.\n\nPenned in by the desolate weather, she recaptured the sense of space\nwhich the motor had tried to rob from her. She remembered again that ten\nsquare miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile, that\na thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven. The\nphantom of bigness, which London encourages, was laid for ever when she\npaced from the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and heard the rain run\nthis way and that where the watershed of the roof divided it.\n\nNow Helen came to her mind, scrutinising half Wessex from the ridge of\nthe Purbeck Downs, and saying: \"You will have to lose something.\" She\nwas not so sure. For instance she would double her kingdom by opening\nthe door that concealed the stairs.\n\nNow she thought of the map of Africa; of empires; of her father; of\nthe two supreme nations, streams of whose life warmed her blood, but,\nmingling, had cooled her brain. She paced back into the hall, and as she\ndid so the house reverberated.\n\n\"Is that you, Henry?\" she called.\n\nThere was no answer, but the house reverberated again.\n\n\"Henry, have you got in?\"\n\nBut it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at first, then\nloudly, martially. It dominated the rain.\n\nIt is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished, that is afraid.\nMargaret flung open the door to the stairs. A noise as of drums seemed\nto deafen her. A woman, an old woman, was descending, with figure erect,\nwith face impassive, with lips that parted and said dryly:\n\n\"Oh! Well, I took you for Ruth Wilcox.\"\n\nMargaret stammered: \"I--Mrs. Wilcox--I?\"\n\n\"In fancy, of course--in fancy. You had her way of walking. Good-day.\"\n And the old woman passed out into the rain.\n\n\n\n",

Of\ncourse, a word from me put it all right, but silly old Miss Avery--she\nfrightened you, didn t she, Margaret? There you stood clutching a bunch\nof weeds. She might have said something, instead of coming down the\nstairs with that alarming bonnet on. I passed her as I came in. Enough\nto make the car shy. I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character;\nsome old maids do.\" He lit a cigarette. \"It is their last resource.\nHeaven knows what she was doing in the place; but that s Bryce s\nbusiness, not mine.\"\n\n\"I wasn t as foolish as you suggest,\" said Margaret \"She only startled\nme, for the house had been silent so long.\"\n\n\"Did you take her for a spook?\" asked Dolly, for whom \"spooks\"  and\n\"going to church\" summarised the unseen.\n\n\"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"She really did frighten you,\" said Henry, who was far from discouraging\ntimidity in females. \"Poor Margaret! And very naturally. Uneducated\nclasses are so stupid.\"\n\n\"Is Miss Avery uneducated classes?\" Margaret asked, and found herself\nlooking at the decoration scheme of Dolly s drawing-room.\n\n\"She s just one of the crew at the farm. People like that always assume\nthings. She assumed you d know who she was. She left all the Howards End\nkeys in the front lobby, and assumed that you d seen them as you came\nin, that you d lock up the house when you d done, and would bring them\non down to her. And there was her niece hunting for them down at the\nfarm. Lack of education makes people very casual. Hilton was full of\nwomen like Miss Avery once.\"\n\n\"I shouldn t have disliked it, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present,\" said Dolly.\n\nWhich was illogical but interesting. Through Dolly, Margaret was\ndestined to learn a good deal.\n\n\"But Charles said I must try not to mind, because she had known his\ngrandmother.\"\n\n\"As usual, you ve got the story wrong, my good Dorothea.\"\n\n\"I meant great-grandmother--the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house.\nWeren t both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End, too, was a\nfarm?\"\n\nHer father-in-law blew out a shaft of smoke. His attitude to his dead\nwife was curious. He would allude to her, and hear her discussed, but\nnever mentioned her by name. Nor was he interested in the dim, bucolic\npast. Dolly was--for the following reason.\n\n\"Then hadn t Mrs. Wilcox a brother--or was it an uncle? Anyhow, he\npopped the question, and Miss Avery, she said  No.  Just imagine, if\nshe d said  Yes,  she would have been Charles s aunt. (Oh, I say,\nthat s rather good!  Charlie s Aunt ! I must chaff him about that this\nevening.) And the man went out and was killed. Yes, I m certain I ve\ngot it right now. Tom Howard--he was the last of them.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said Mr. Wilcox negligently.\n\n\"I say! Howards End--Howards Ended!\" cried Dolly. \"I m rather on the\nspot this evening, eh?\"\n\n\"I wish you d ask whether Crane s ended.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Wilcox, how can you?\"\n\n\"Because, if he has had enough tea, we ought to go--Dolly s a good\nlittle woman,\" he continued, \"but a little of her goes a long way. I\ncouldn t live near her if you paid me.\"\n\nMargaret smiled. Though presenting a firm front to outsiders, no Wilcox\ncould live near, or near the possessions of, any other Wilcox. They\nhad the colonial spirit, and were always making for some spot where the\nwhite man might carry his burden unobserved. Of course, Howards End was\nimpossible, so long as the younger couple were established in Hilton.\nHis objections to the house were plain as daylight now.\n\nCrane had had enough tea, and was sent to the garage, where their car\nhad been trickling muddy water over Charles s. The downpour had\nsurely penetrated the Six Hills by now, bringing news of our restless\ncivilisation. \"Curious mounds,\" said Henry, \"but in with you now;\nanother time.\" He had to be up in London by seven--if possible, by\nsix-thirty. Once more she lost the sense of space; once more trees,\nhouses, people, animals, hills, merged and heaved into one dirtiness,\nand she was at Wickham Place.\n\nHer evening was pleasant. The sense of flux which had haunted her\nall the year disappeared for a time. She forgot the luggage and the\nmotor-cars, and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little.\nShe recaptured the sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly\nbeauty, and, starting from Howards End, she attempted to realise\nEngland. She failed--visions do not come when we try, though they may\ncome through trying. But an unexpected love of the island awoke in her,\nconnecting on this side with the joys of the flesh, on that with the\ninconceivable. Helen and her father had known this love, poor Leonard\nBast was groping after it, but it had been hidden from Margaret till\nthis afternoon. It had certainly come through the house and old Miss\nAvery. Through them: the notion of \"through\" persisted; her mind\ntrembled towards a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words.\nThen, veering back into warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering\nplum-trees, and all the tangible joys of spring.\n\nHenry, after allaying her agitation, had taken her over his property,\nand had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms. He\nhad sketched the history of the little estate. \"It is so unlucky,\" ran\nthe monologue, \"that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago.\nThen it had four--five--times the land--thirty acres at least. One\ncould have made something out of it then--a small park, or at all events\nshrubberies, and rebuilt the house farther away from the road. What s\nthe good of taking it in hand now? Nothing but the meadow left, and even\nthat was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things--yes, and\nthe house too. Oh, it was no joke.\" She saw two women as he spoke, one\nold, the other young, watching their inheritance melt away. She saw them\ngreet him as a deliverer. \"Mismanagement did it--besides, the days for\nsmall farms are over. It doesn t pay--except with intensive cultivation.\nSmall holdings, back to the land--ah! philanthropic bunkum. Take it as a\nrule that nothing pays on a small scale. Most of the land you see (they\nwere standing at an upper window, the only one which faced west) belongs\nto the people at the Park--they made their pile over copper--good chaps.\nAvery s Farm, Sishe s--what they call the Common, where you see that\nruined oak--one after the other fell in, and so did this, as near as\nis no matter.\" But Henry had saved it as near as is no matter without fine \nfeelings or deep insight, but he had saved it, and she loved him for the deed. \n\"When I had more control I did what I could--sold off the two and a half\nanimals, and the mangy pony, and the superannuated tools; pulled down\nthe outhouses; drained; thinned out I don t know how many guelder-roses\nand elder-trees; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a\nhall, and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was. Garage and so on\ncame later. But one could still tell it s been an old farm. And yet\nit isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew.\" No, it\nwasn t; and if he did not quite understand it, the artistic crew would\nstill less; it was English, and the wych-elm that she saw from the\nwindow was an English tree. No report had prepared her for its peculiar\nglory. It was neither warrior, nor lover, nor god; in none of these\nroles do the English excel. It was a comrade bending over the house,\nstrength and adventure in its roots, but in its utmost fingers\ntenderness, and the girth, that a dozen men could not have spanned,\nbecame in the end evanescent, till pale bud clusters seemed to float\nin the air. It was a comrade. House and tree transcended any similes of\nsex. Margaret thought of them now, and was to think of them through many\na windy night and London day, but to compare either to man, to woman,\nalways dwarfed the vision. Yet they kept within limits of the human.\nTheir message was not of eternity, but of hope on this side of the\ngrave. As she stood in the one, gazing at the other, truer relationship\nhad gleamed.\n\nAnother touch, and the account of her day is finished. They entered the\ngarden for a minute, and to Mr. Wilcox s surprise she was right. Teeth,\npigs  teeth, could be seen in the bark of the wych-elm tree--just the\nwhite tips of them showing. \"Extraordinary!\" he cried. \"Who told you?\"\n\n\"I heard of it one winter in London,\" was her answer, for she, too,\navoided mentioning Mrs. Wilcox by name.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXV\n\nEvie heard of her father s engagement when she was in for a tennis\ntournament, and her play went simply to pot. That she should marry and\nleave him had seemed natural enough; that he, left alone, should do the\nsame was deceitful; and now Charles and Dolly said that it was all her\nfault. \"But I never dreamt of such a thing,\" she grumbled. \"Dad took\nme to call now and then, and made me ask her to Simpson s. Well, I m\naltogether off dad.\" It was also an insult to their mother s memory;\nthere they were agreed, and Evie had the idea of returning Mrs. Wilcox s\nlace and jewellery \"as a protest.\" Against what it would protest she was\nnot clear; but being only eighteen, the idea of renunciation appealed\nto her, the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace. Dolly then\nsuggested that she and Uncle Percy should pretend to break off their\nengagement, and then perhaps Mr. Wilcox would quarrel with Miss\nSchlegel, and break off his; or Paul might be cabled for. But at this\npoint Charles told them not to talk nonsense. So Evie settled to marry\nas soon as possible; it was no good hanging about with these Schlegels\neyeing her. The date of her wedding was consequently put forward from\nSeptember to August, and in the intoxication of presents she recovered\nmuch of her good-humour.\n\nMargaret found that she was expected to figure at this function, and to\nfigure largely; it would be such an opportunity, said Henry, for her\nto get to know his set. Sir James Bidder would be there, and all the\nCahills and the Fussells, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox,\nhad fortunately got back from her tour round the world. Henry she loved,\nbut his set promised to be another matter. He had not the knack of\nsurrounding himself with nice people--indeed, for a man of ability and\nvirtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate; he had no guiding\nprinciple beyond a certain preference for mediocrity; he was content to\nsettle one of the greatest things in life haphazard, and so, while his\ninvestments went right, his friends generally went wrong. She would be\ntold, \"Oh, So-and-so s a good sort--a thundering good sort,\" and find,\non meeting him, that he was a brute or a bore. If Henry had shown real\naffection, she would have understood, for affection explains everything.\nBut he seemed without sentiment. The \"thundering good sort\" might at\nany moment become \"a fellow for whom I never did have much use, and have\nless now,\" and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion. Margaret had done\nthe same as a schoolgirl. Now she never forgot any one for whom she had\nonce cared; she connected, though the connection might be bitter, and\nshe hoped that some day Henry would do the same.\n\nEvie was not to be married from Ducie Street. She had a fancy for\nsomething rural, and, besides, no one would be in London then, so she\nleft her boxes for a few weeks at Oniton Grange, and her banns were\nduly published in the parish church, and for a couple of days the little\ntown, dreaming between the ruddy hills, was roused by the clang of our\ncivilisation, and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass. Oniton\nhad been a discovery of Mr. Wilcox s--a discovery of which he was not\naltogether proud. It was up towards the Welsh border, and so difficult\nof access that he had concluded it must be something special. A ruined\ncastle stood in the grounds. But having got there, what was one to do?\nThe shooting was bad, the fishing indifferent, and womenfolk reported\nthe scenery as nothing much. The place turned out to be in the wrong\npart of Shropshire, and though he never ran down his own property to\nothers, he was only waiting to get it off his hands, and then to let\nfly. Evie s marriage was its last appearance in public. As soon as a\ntenant was found, it became a house for which he never had had much use,\nand had less now, and, like Howards End, faded into Limbo.\n\nBut on Margaret Oniton was destined to make a lasting impression. She\nregarded it as her future home, and was anxious to start straight with\nthe clergy, etc., and, if possible, to see something of the local life.\nIt was a market-town--as tiny a one as England possesses--and had for\nages served that lonely valley, and guarded our marches against the\nCelt. In spite of the occasion, in spite of the numbing hilarity that\ngreeted her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at Paddington,\nher senses were awake and watching, and though Oniton was to prove one\nof her innumerable false starts, she never forgot it, or the things that\nhappened there.\n\nThe London party only numbered eight--the Fussells, father and son,\ntwo Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs. Plynlimmon and Lady Edser, Mrs.\nWarrington Wilcox and her daughter, and, lastly, the little girl,\nvery smart and quiet, who figures at so many weddings, and who kept a\nwatchful eye on Margaret, the bride-elect. Dolly was absent--a domestic\nevent detained her at Hilton; Paul had cabled a humorous message;\nCharles was to meet them with a trio of motors at Shrewsbury; Helen had\nrefused her invitation; Tibby had never answered his. The management was\nexcellent, as was to be expected with anything that Henry undertook; one\nwas conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the background. They\nwere his guests as soon as they reached the train; a special label\nfor their luggage; a courier; a special lunch; they had only to look\npleasant and, where possible, pretty. Margaret thought with dismay\nof her own nuptials--presumably under the management of Tibby. \"Mr.\nTheobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the pleasure of Mrs.\nPlynlimmon s company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister\nMargaret.\" The formula was incredible, but it must soon be printed and\nsent, and though Wickham Place need not compete with Oniton, it must\nfeed its guests properly, and provide them with sufficient chairs. Her\nwedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeois--she hoped the latter.\nSuch an affair as the present, staged with a deftness that was almost\nbeautiful, lay beyond her powers and those of her friends.\n\nThe low rich purr of a Great Western express is not the worst background\nfor conversation, and the journey passed pleasantly enough. Nothing\ncould have exceeded the kindness of the two men. They raised windows\nfor some ladies, and lowered them for others, they rang the bell for the\nservant, they identified the colleges as the train slipped past Oxford,\nthey caught books or bag-purses in the act of tumbling on to the floor.\nYet there was nothing finicking about their politeness--it had the\npublic-school touch, and, though sedulous, was virile. More battles than\nWaterloo have been won on our playing-fields, and Margaret bowed to a\ncharm of which she did not wholly approve, and said nothing when the\nOxford colleges were identified wrongly. \"Male and female created He\nthem\"; the journey to Shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement,\nand the long glass saloon, that moved so easily and felt so comfortable,\nbecame a forcing-house for the idea of sex.\n\nAt Shrewsbury came fresh air. Margaret was all for sight-seeing, and\nwhile the others were finishing their tea at the Raven, she annexed a\nmotor and hurried over the astonishing city. Her chauffeur was not\nthe faithful Crane, but an Italian, who dearly loved making her late.\nCharles, watch in hand, though with a level brow, was standing in front\nof the hotel when they returned. It was perfectly all right, he\ntold her; she was by no means the last. And then he dived into the\ncoffee-room, and she heard him say, \"For God s sake, hurry the women up;\nwe shall never be off,\" and Albert Fussell reply, \"Not I; I ve done\nmy share,\" and Colonel Fussell opine that the ladies were getting\nthemselves up to kill. Presently Myra (Mrs. Warrington s daughter)\nappeared, and as she was his cousin, Charles blew her up a little; she\nhad been changing her smart travelling hat for a smart motor hat. Then\nMrs. Warrington herself, leading the quiet child; the two Anglo-Indian\nladies were always last. Maids, courier, heavy luggage, had already\ngone on by a branch-line to a station nearer Oniton, but there were five\nhat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be packed, and five dust-cloaks\nto be put on, and to be put off at the last moment, because Charles\ndeclared them not necessary. The men presided over everything with\nunfailing good-humour. By half-past five the party was ready, and went\nout of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge.\n\nShropshire had not the reticence of Hertfordshire. Though robbed of half\nits magic by swift movement, it still conveyed the sense of hills. They\nwere nearing the buttresses that force the Severn eastward and make it\nan English stream, and the sun, sinking over the Sentinels of Wales,\nwas straight in their eyes. Having picked up another guest, they\nturned southward, avoiding the greater mountains, but conscious of an\noccasional summit, rounded and mild, whose colouring differed in quality\nfrom that of the lower earth, and whose contours altered more slowly.\nQuiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons: the\nWest, as ever, was retreating with some secret which may not be worth\nthe discovery, but which no practical man will ever discover.\n\nThey spoke of Tariff Reform.\n\nMrs. Warrington was just back from the Colonies. Like many other critics\nof Empire, her mouth had been stopped with food, and she could only\nexclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received, and warn\nthe Mother Country against trifling with young Titans. \"They threaten to\ncut the painter,\" she cried, \"and where shall we be then? Miss Schlegel,\nyou ll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff Reform? It is our last\nhope.\"\n\nMargaret playfully confessed herself on the other side, and they began\nto quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them\ndeep into the hills. Curious these were rather than impressive, for\ntheir outlines lacked beauty, and the pink fields on their summits\nsuggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry. An occasional\noutcrop of rock, an occasional wood, an occasional \"forest,\" treeless\nand brown, all hinted at wildness to follow, but the main colour was an\nagricultural green. The air grew cooler; they had surmounted the last\ngradient, and Oniton lay below them with its church, its radiating\nhouses, its castle, its river-girt peninsula. Close to the castle was\na grey mansion unintellectual but kindly, stretching with its grounds\nacross the peninsula s neck--the sort of mansion that was built all over\nEngland in the beginning of the last century, while architecture was\nstill an expression of the national character. That was the Grange,\nremarked Albert, over his shoulder, and then he jammed the brake on, and\nthe motor slowed down and stopped. \"I m sorry,\" said he, turning round.\n\"Do you mind getting out--by the door on the right. Steady on.\"\n\n\"What s happened?\" asked Mrs. Warrington.\n\nThen the car behind them drew up, and the voice of Charles was heard\nsaying: \"Get the women out at once.\" There was a concourse of males,\nand Margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the\nsecond car. What had happened? As it started off again, the door of a\ncottage opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.\n\n\"What is it?\" the ladies cried.\n\nCharles drove them a hundred yards without speaking. Then he said: \"It s\nall right. Your car just touched a dog.\"\n\n\"But stop!\" cried Margaret, horrified.\n\n\"It didn t hurt him.\"\n\n\"Didn t really hurt him?\" asked Myra.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do PLEASE stop!\" said Margaret, leaning forward. She was standing up in\nthe car, the other occupants holding her knees to steady her. \"I want to\ngo back, please.\"\n\nCharles took no notice.\n\n\"We ve left Mr. Fussell behind,\" said another; \"and Angelo, and Crane.\"\n\n\"Yes, but no woman.\"\n\n\"I expect a little of\"--Mrs. Warrington scratched her palm--\"will be\nmore to the point than one of us!\"\n\n\"The insurance company see to that,\" remarked Charles, \"and Albert will\ndo the talking.\"\n\n\"I want to go back, though, I say!\" repeated Margaret, getting angry.\n\nCharles took no notice. The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to\ntravel very slowly down the hill. \"The men are there,\" chorused the\nothers. \"They will see to it.\"\n\n\"The men CAN T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous! Charles, I ask you to\nstop.\"\n\n\"Stopping s no good,\" drawled Charles.\n\n\"Isn t it?\" said Margaret, and jumped straight out of the car. She fell\non her knees, cut her gloves, shook her hat over her ear. Cries of alarm\nfollowed her. \"You ve hurt yourself,\" exclaimed Charles, jumping after\nher.\n\n\"Of course I ve hurt myself!\" she retorted.\n\n\"May I ask what--\"\n\n\"There s nothing to ask,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Your hand s bleeding.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I m in for a frightful row from the pater.\"\n\n\"You should have thought of that sooner, Charles.\"\n\nCharles had never been in such a position before. It was a woman in\nrevolt who was hobbling away from him--and the sight was too strange to\nleave any room for anger. He recovered himself when the others caught\nthem up: their sort he understood. He commanded them to go back.\n\nAlbert Fussell was seen walking towards them.\n\n\"It s all right!\" he called. \"It was a cat.\"\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Charles triumphantly. \"It s only a rotten cat.\"\n\n\"Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as I saw it wasn t\na dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl.\" But Margaret walked\nforward steadily. Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl? Ladies\nsheltering behind men, men sheltering behind servants--the whole\nsystem s wrong, and she must challenge it.\n\n\"Miss Schlegel!  Pon my word, you ve hurt your hand.\"\n\n\"I m just going to see,\" said Margaret. \"Don t you wait, Mr. Fussell.\"\n\nThe second motor came round the corner. \"It is all right, madam,\" said\nCrane in his turn. He had taken to calling her madam.\n\n\"What s all right? The cat?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam. The girl will receive compensation for it.\"\n\n\"She was a very ruda girla,\" said Angelo from the third motor\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Wouldn t you have been rude?\"\n\nThe Italian spread out his hands, implying that he had not thought of\nrudeness, but would produce it if it pleased her. The situation became\nabsurd. The gentlemen were again buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers\nof assistance, and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand. She yielded,\napologising slightly, and was led back to the car, and soon the\nlandscape resumed its motion, the lonely cottage disappeared, the castle\nswelled on its cushion of turf, and they had arrived. No doubt she had\ndisgraced herself. But she felt their whole journey from London had\nbeen unreal. They had no part with the earth and its emotions. They were\ndust, and a stink, and cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl whose cat had\nbeen killed had lived more deeply than they.\n\n\"Oh, Henry,\" she exclaimed, \"I have been so naughty,\" for she had\ndecided to take up this line. \"We ran over a cat. Charles told me not to\njump out, but I would, and look!\" She held out her bandaged hand. \"Your\npoor Meg went such a flop.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox looked bewildered. In evening dress, he was standing to\nwelcome his guests in the hall.\n\n\"Thinking it was a dog,\" added Mrs. Warrington.\n\n\"Ah, a dog s a companion!\" said Colonel Fussell. \"A dog ll remember you.\"\n\n\"Have you hurt yourself, Margaret?\"\n\n\"Not to speak about; and it s my left hand.\"\n\n\"Well, hurry up and change.\"\n\nShe obeyed, as did the others. Mr. Wilcox then turned to his son.\n\n\"Now, Charles, what s happened?\"\n\nCharles was absolutely honest. He described what he believed to have\nhappened. Albert had flattened out a cat, and Miss Schlegel had lost her\nnerve, as any woman might. She had been got safely into the other car,\nbut when it was in motion had leapt out again, in spite of all that they\ncould say. After walking a little on the road, she had calmed down and\nhad said that she was sorry. His father accepted this explanation, and\nneither knew that Margaret had artfully prepared the way for it.\nIt fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature. In the\nsmoking-room, after dinner, the Colonel put forward the view that Miss\nSchlegel had jumped it out of devilry. Well he remembered as a young\nman, in the harbour of Gibraltar once, how a girl--a handsome girl,\ntoo--had jumped overboard for a bet. He could see her now, and all the\nlads overboard after her. But Charles and Mr. Wilcox agreed it was much\nmore probably nerves in Miss Schlegel s case. Charles was depressed.\nThat woman had a tongue. She would bring worse disgrace on his father\nbefore she had done with them. He strolled out on to the castle mound to\nthink the matter over. The evening was exquisite. On three sides of him\na little river whispered, full of messages from the West; above his head\nthe ruins made patterns against the sky. He carefully reviewed their\ndealings with this family, until he fitted Helen, and Margaret, and Aunt\nJuley into an orderly conspiracy. Paternity had made him suspicious.\nHe had two children to look after, and more coming, and day by day\nthey seemed less likely to grow up rich men. \"It is all very well,\"\n he reflected, \"the pater s saying that he will be just to all, but one\ncan t be just indefinitely. Money isn t elastic. What s to happen if\nEvie has a family? And, come to that, so may the pater. There ll not be\nenough to go round, for there s none coming in, either through Dolly or\nPercy. It s damnable!\" He looked enviously at the Grange, whose windows\npoured light and laughter. First and last, this wedding would cost a\npretty penny. Two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace,\nand as the syllables \"Imperialism\" were wafted to his ears, he guessed\nthat one of them was his aunt. She might have helped him, if she too had\nnot had a family to provide for. \"Every one for himself,\" he repeated--a\nmaxim which had cheered him in the past, but which rang grimly enough\namong the ruins of Oniton. He lacked his father s ability in business,\nand so had an ever higher regard for money; unless he could inherit\nplenty, he feared to leave his children poor.\n\nAs he sat thinking, one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into\nthe meadow; he recognised her as Margaret by the white bandage that\ngleamed on her arm, and put out his cigar, lest the gleam should betray\nhim. She climbed up the mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as\nif she was stroking the turf. It sounds absolutely incredible, but for\na moment Charles thought that she was in love with him, and had come out\nto tempt him. Charles believed in temptresses, who are indeed the strong\nman s necessary complement, and having no sense of humour, he could not\npurge himself of the thought by a smile. Margaret, who was engaged to\nhis father, and his sister s wedding-guest, kept on her way without\nnoticing him, and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point. But\nwhat was she doing? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and\ncatching her dress in brambles and burrs? As she edged round the\nkeep, she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar-smoke, for she\nexclaimed, \"Hullo! Who s that?\"\n\nCharles made no answer.\n\n\"Saxon or Celt?\" she continued, laughing in the darkness. \"But it\ndoesn t matter. Whichever you are, you will have to listen to me. I love\nthis place. I love Shropshire. I hate London. I am glad that this will\nbe my home. Ah, dear\"--she was now moving back towards the house--\"what\na comfort to have arrived!\"\n\n\"That woman means mischief,\" thought Charles, and compressed his lips.\nIn a few minutes he followed her indoors, as the ground was getting\ndamp. Mists were rising from the river, and presently it became\ninvisible, though it whispered more loudly. There had been a heavy\ndownpour in the Welsh hills.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVI\n\nNext morning a fine mist covered the peninsula. The weather promised\nwell, and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that\nMargaret watched it. Presently she saw the keep, and the sun painted\nthe rubble gold, and charged the white sky with blue. The shadow of the\nhouse gathered itself together, and fell over the garden. A cat looked\nup at her window and mewed. Lastly the river appeared, still holding the\nmists between its banks and its overhanging alders, and only visible as\nfar as a hill, which cut off its upper reaches.\n\nMargaret was fascinated by Oniton. She had said that she loved it, but\nit was rather its romantic tension that held her. The rounded Druids of\nwhom she had caught glimpses in her drive, the rivers hurrying down\nfrom them to England, the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills,\nthrilled her with poetry. The house was insignificant, but the prospect\nfrom it would be an eternal joy, and she thought of all the friends she\nwould have to stop in it, and of the conversion of Henry himself to a\nrural life. Society, too, promised favourably. The rector of the parish\nhad dined with them last night, and she found that he was a friend of\nher father s, and so knew what to find in her. She liked him. He would\nintroduce her to the town. While, on her other side, Sir James Bidder\nsat, repeating that she only had to give the word, and he would whip up\nthe county families for twenty miles round. Whether Sir James, who was\nGarden Seeds, had promised what he could perform, she doubted, but so\nlong as Henry mistook them for the county families when they did call,\nshe was content.\n\nCharles Wilcox and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn. They were going\nfor a morning dip, and a servant followed them with their bathing-suits.\nShe had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast, but saw that\nthe day was still sacred to men, and amused herself by watching their\ncontretemps. In the first place the key of the bathing-shed could not be\nfound. Charles stood by the riverside with folded hands, tragical, while\nthe servant shouted, and was misunderstood by another servant in the\ngarden. Then came a difficulty about a springboard, and soon three\npeople were running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders\nand counter orders and recriminations and apologies. If Margaret wanted\nto jump from a motor-car, she jumped; if Tibby thought paddling would\nbenefit his ankles, he paddled; if a clerk desired adventure, he took\na walk in the dark. But these athletes seemed paralysed. They could not\nbathe without their appliances, though the morning sun was calling and\nthe last mists were rising from the dimpling stream. Had they found\nthe life of the body after all? Could not the men whom they despised as\nmilksops beat them, even on their own ground?\n\nShe thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day--no\nworrying of servants, no appliances, beyond good sense. Her reflections\nwere disturbed by the quiet child, who had come out to speak to the\ncat, but was now watching her watch the men. She called, \"Good-morning,\ndear,\" a little sharply. Her voice spread consternation. Charles looked\nround, and though completely attired in indigo blue, vanished into the\nshed, and was seen no more.\n\n\"Miss Wilcox is up--\" the child whispered, and then became\nunintelligible.\n\n\"What is that?\" it sounded like, \"--cut-yoke--sack-back--\"\n\n\"I can t hear.\"\n\n\"--On the bed--tissue-paper--\"\n\nGathering that the wedding-dress was on view, and that a visit would\nbe seemly, she went to Evie s room. All was hilarity here. Evie, in a\npetticoat, was dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the\nother was adoring yards of white satin. They screamed, they laughed,\nthey sang, and the dog barked.\n\nMargaret screamed a little too, but without conviction. She could not\nfeel that a wedding was so funny. Perhaps something was missing in her\nequipment.\n\nEvie gasped: \"Dolly is a rotter not to be here! Oh, we would rag just\nthen!\" Then Margaret went down to breakfast.\n\nHenry was already installed; he ate slowly and spoke little, and was,\nin Margaret s eyes, the only member of their party who dodged emotion\nsuccessfully. She could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss\nof his daughter or to the presence of his future wife. Yet he dwelt\nintact, only issuing orders occasionally--orders that promoted the\ncomfort of his guests. He inquired after her hand; he set her to pour\nout the coffee and Mrs. Warrington to pour out the tea. When Evie came\ndown there was a moment s awkwardness, and both ladies rose to vacate\ntheir places. \"Burton,\" called Henry, \"serve tea and coffee from the\nsideboard!\" It wasn t genuine tact, but it was tact, of a sort--the\nsort that is as useful as the genuine, and saves even more situations at\nBoard meetings. Henry treated a marriage like a funeral, item by item,\nnever raising his eyes to the whole, and \"Death, where is thy sting?\nLove, where is thy victory?\" one would exclaim at the close.\n\nAfter breakfast Margaret claimed a few words with him. It was always\nbest to approach him formally. She asked for the interview, because he\nwas going on to shoot grouse to-morrow, and she was returning to Helen\nin town.\n\n\"Certainly, dear,\" said he. \"Of course, I have the time. What do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I was afraid something had gone wrong.\"\n\n\"No; I have nothing to say, but you may talk.\"\n\nGlancing at his watch, he talked of the nasty curve at the lych-gate.\nShe heard him with interest. Her surface could always respond to his\nwithout contempt, though all her deeper being might be yearning to help\nhim. She had abandoned any plan of action. Love is the best, and the\nmore she let herself love him, the more chance was there that he would\nset his soul in order. Such a moment as this, when they sat under fair\nweather by the walks of their future home, was so sweet to her that\nits sweetness would surely pierce to him. Each lift of his eyes, each\nparting of the thatched lip from the clean-shaven, must prelude\nthe tenderness that kills the Monk and the Beast at a single blow.\nDisappointed a hundred times, she still hoped. She loved him with too\nclear a vision to fear his cloudiness. Whether he droned trivialities,\nas to-day, or sprang kisses on her in the twilight, she could pardon\nhim, she could respond.\n\n\"If there is this nasty curve,\" she suggested, \"couldn t we walk to the\nchurch? Not, of course, you and Evie; but the rest of us might very well\ngo on first, and that would mean fewer carriages.\"\n\n\"One can t have ladies walking through the Market Square. The Fussells\nwouldn t like it; they were awfully particular at Charles s wedding.\nMy--she--our party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was\njust round the corner, and I shouldn t have minded; but the Colonel made\na great point of it.\"\n\n\"You men shouldn t be so chivalrous,\" said Margaret thoughtfully.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nShe knew why not, but said that she did not know. He then announced\nthat, unless she had anything special to say, he must visit the\nwine-cellar, and they went off together in search of Burton. Though\nclumsy and a little inconvenient, Oniton was a genuine country-house.\nThey clattered down flagged passages, looking into room after room,\nand scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties. The\nwedding-breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church,\nand tea would be served in the garden. The sight of so many agitated\nand serious people made Margaret smile, but she reflected that they\nwere paid to be serious, and enjoyed being agitated. Here were the lower\nwheels of the machine that was tossing Evie up into nuptial glory. A\nlittle boy blocked their way with pig-pails. His mind could not grasp\ntheir greatness, and he said: \"By your leave; let me pass, please.\"\n Henry asked him where Burton was. But the servants were so new that they\ndid not know one another s names. In the still-room sat the band, who\nhad stipulated for champagne as part of their fee, and who were already\ndrinking beer. Scents of Araby came from the kitchen, mingled with\ncries. Margaret knew what had happened there, for it happened at Wickham\nPlace. One of the wedding dishes had boiled over, and the cook was\nthrowing cedar-shavings to hide the smell. At last they came upon\nthe butler. Henry gave him the keys, and handed Margaret down the\ncellar-stairs. Two doors were unlocked. She, who kept all her wine at\nthe bottom of the linen-cupboard, was astonished at the sight. \"We shall\nnever get through it!\" she cried, and the two men were suddenly drawn\ninto brotherhood, and exchanged smiles. She felt as if she had again\njumped out of the car while it was moving.\n\nCertainly Oniton would take some digesting. It would be no small\nbusiness to remain herself, and yet to assimilate such an establishment.\nShe must remain herself, for his sake as well as her own, since a\nshadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies; and she must\nassimilate for reasons of common honesty, since she had no right to\nmarry a man and make him uncomfortable. Her only ally was the power of\nHome. The loss of Wickham Place had taught her more than its possession.\nHowards End had repeated the lesson. She was determined to create new\nsanctities among these hills.\n\nAfter visiting the wine-cellar, she dressed, and then came the wedding,\nwhich seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it.\nEverything went like one o clock. Mr. Cahill materialised out of space,\nand was waiting for his bride at the church door. No one dropped the\nring or mispronounced the responses, or trod on Evie s train, or cried.\nIn a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty, the register was\nsigned, and they were back in their carriages, negotiating the dangerous\ncurve by the lych-gate. Margaret was convinced that they had not been\nmarried at all, and that the Norman church had been intent all the time\non other business.\n\nThere were more documents to sign at the house, and the breakfast to\neat, and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party. There\nhad been a great many refusals, and after all it was not a very big\naffair--not as big as Margaret s would be. She noted the dishes and\nthe strips of red carpet, that outwardly she might give Henry what was\nproper. But inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of\nSunday church and fox-hunting. If only some one had been upset! But this\nwedding had gone off so particularly well--\"quite like a durbar\" in the\nopinion of Lady Edser, and she thoroughly agreed with her.\n\nSo the wasted day lumbered forward, the bride and bridegroom drove off,\nyelling with laughter, and for the second time the sun retreated towards\nthe hills of Wales. Henry, who was more tired than he owned, came up to\nher in the castle meadow, and, in tones of unusual softness, said that\nhe was pleased. Everything had gone off so well. She felt that he was\npraising her, too, and blushed; certainly she had done all she could\nwith his intractable friends, and had made a special point of kotowing\nto the men. They were breaking camp this evening; only the Warringtons\nand quiet child would stay the night, and the others were already moving\ntowards the house to finish their packing. \"I think it did go off\nwell,\" she agreed. \"Since I had to jump out of the motor, I m thankful I\nlighted on my left hand. I am so very glad about it, Henry dear; I only\nhope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all\nremember that we have no practical person among us, except my aunt, and\nshe is not used to entertainments on a large scale.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said gravely. \"Under the circumstances, it would be better\nto put everything into the hands of Harrods or Whiteley s, or even to go\nto some hotel.\"\n\n\"You desire a hotel?\"\n\n\"Yes, because--well, I mustn t interfere with you. No doubt you want to\nbe married from your old home.\"\n\n\"My old home s falling into pieces, Henry. I only want my new. Isn t it\na perfect evening--\"\n\n\"The Alexandrina isn t bad--\"\n\n\"The Alexandrina,\" she echoed, more occupied with the threads of smoke\nthat were issuing from their chimneys, and ruling the sunlit slopes with\nparallels of grey.\n\n\"It s off Curzon Street.\"\n\n\"Is it? Let s be married from off Curzon Street.\"\n\nThen she turned westward, to gaze at the swirling gold. Just where the\nriver rounded the hill the sun caught it. Fairyland must lie above the\nbend, and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past Charles s\nbathing-shed. She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled, and when\nthey moved back to the house, she could not recognise the faces of\npeople who were coming out of it. A parlour-maid was preceding them.\n\n\"Who are those people?\" she asked.\n\n\"They re callers!\" exclaimed Henry. \"It s too late for callers.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents.\"\n\n\"I m not at home yet to townees.\"\n\n\"Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can stop them, I will.\"\n\nHe thanked her.\n\nMargaret went forward, smiling socially. She supposed that these were\nunpunctual guests, who would have to be content with vicarious civility,\nsince Evie and Charles were gone, Henry tired, and the others in their\nrooms. She assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long. For one of the\ngroup was Helen--Helen in her oldest clothes, and dominated by that\ntense, wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery\ndays.\n\n\"What is it?\" she called. \"Oh, what s wrong? Is Tibby ill?\"\n\nHelen spoke to her two companions, who fell back. Then she bore forward\nfuriously.\n\n\"They re starving!\" she shouted. \"I found them starving!\"\n\n\"Who? Why have you come?\"\n\n\"The Basts.\"\n\n\"Oh, Helen!\" moaned Margaret. \"Whatever have you done now?\"\n\n\"He has lost his place. He has been turned out of his bank. Yes, he s\ndone for. We upper classes have ruined him, and I suppose you ll tell\nme it s the battle of life. Starving. His wife is ill. Starving. She\nfainted in the train.\"\n\n\"Helen, are you mad?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Yes. If you like, I m mad. But I ve brought them. I ll stand\ninjustice no longer. I ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this\nluxury, this talk of impersonal forces, this cant about God doing what\nwe re too slack to do ourselves.\"\n\n\"Have you actually brought two starving people from London to\nShropshire, Helen?\"\n\nHelen was checked. She had not thought of this, and her hysteria abated.\n\"There was a restaurant car on the train,\" she said.\n\n\"Don t be absurd. They aren t starving, and you know it. Now, begin from\nthe beginning. I won t have such theatrical nonsense. How dare you! Yes,\nhow dare you!\" she repeated, as anger filled her, \"bursting in to Evie s\nwedding in this heartless way. My goodness! but you ve a perverted\nnotion of philanthropy. Look\"--she indicated the house--\"servants,\npeople out of the windows. They think it s some vulgar scandal, and\nI must explain,  Oh no, it s only my sister screaming, and only two\nhangers-on of ours, whom she has brought here for no conceivable\nreason. \"\n\n\"Kindly take back that word  hangers-on, \" said Helen, ominously calm.\n\n\"Very well,\" conceded Margaret, who for all her wrath was determined to\navoid a real quarrel. \"I, too, am sorry about them, but it beats me why\nyou ve brought them here, or why you re here yourself.\"\n\n\"It s our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\nMargaret moved towards the house at this. She was determined not to\nworry Henry.\n\n\"He s going to Scotland. I know he is. I insist on seeing him.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I knew it was our last chance.\"\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Bast?\" said Margaret, trying to control her voice.\n\"This is an odd business. What view do you take of it?\"\n\n\"There is Mrs. Bast, too,\" prompted Helen.\n\nJacky also shook hands. She, like her husband, was shy, and,\nfurthermore, ill, and furthermore, so bestially stupid that she could\nnot grasp what was happening. She only knew that the lady had swept down\nlike a whirlwind last night, had paid the rent, redeemed the furniture,\nprovided them with a dinner and a breakfast, and ordered them to meet\nher at Paddington next morning. Leonard had feebly protested, and when\nthe morning came, had suggested that they shouldn t go. But she, half\nmesmerised, had obeyed. The lady had told them to, and they must, and\ntheir bed-sitting-room had accordingly changed into Paddington, and\nPaddington into a railway carriage, that shook, and grew hot, and grew\ncold, and vanished entirely, and reappeared amid torrents of expensive\nscent. \"You have fainted,\" said the lady in an awe-struck voice.\n\"Perhaps the air will do you good.\" And perhaps it had, for here she\nwas, feeling rather better among a lot of flowers.\n\n\"I m sure I don t want to intrude,\" began Leonard, in answer to\nMargaret s question. \"But you have been so kind to me in the past\nin warning me about the Porphyrion that I wondered--why, I wondered\nwhether--\"\n\n\"Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again,\" supplied\nHelen. \"Meg, this has been a cheerful business. A bright evening s work\nthat was on Chelsea Embankment.\"\n\nMargaret shook her head and returned to Mr. Bast.\n\n\"I don t understand. You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was\na bad concern, didn t you?\"\n\n\"That s right.\"\n\n\"And went into a bank instead?\"\n\n\"I told you all that,\" said Helen; \"and they reduced their staff after\nhe had been in a month, and now he s penniless, and I consider that we\nand our informant are directly to blame.\"\n\n\"I hate all this,\" Leonard muttered.\n\n\"I hope you do, Mr. Bast. But it s no good mincing matters. You have\ndone yourself no good by coming here. If you intend to confront Mr.\nWilcox, and to call him to account for a chance remark, you will make a\nvery great mistake.\"\n\n\"I brought them. I did it all,\" cried Helen.\n\n\"I can only advise you to go at once. My sister has put you in a false\nposition, and it is kindest to tell you so. It s too late to get to\ntown, but you ll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton, where Mrs. Bast can\nrest, and I hope you ll be my guests there.\"\n\n\"That isn t what I want, Miss Schlegel,\" said Leonard. \"You re very\nkind, and no doubt it s a false position, but you make me miserable. I\nseem no good at all.\"\n\n\"It s work he wants,\" interpreted Helen. \"Can t you see?\"\n\nThen he said: \"Jacky, let s go. We re more bother than we re worth.\nWe re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us,\nand they never will. There s nothing we re good enough to do.\"\n\n\"We would like to find you work,\" said Margaret rather conventionally.\n\"We want to--I, like my sister. You re only down in your luck. Go to the\nhotel, have a good night s rest, and some day you shall pay me back the\nbill, if you prefer it.\"\n\nBut Leonard was near the abyss, and at such moments men see clearly.\n\"You don t know what you re talking about,\" he said. \"I shall never get\nwork now. If rich people fail at one profession, they can try another.\nNot I. I had my groove, and I ve got out of it. I could do one\nparticular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to\ncommand a salary, but that s all. Poetry s nothing, Miss Schlegel. One s\nthoughts about this and that are nothing. Your money, too, is nothing,\nif you ll understand me. I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own\nparticular job, it s all over with him. I have seen it happen to others.\nTheir friends gave them money for a little, but in the end they fall\nover the edge. It s no good. It s the whole world pulling. There always\nwill be rich and poor.\"\n\nHe ceased. \"Won t you have something to eat?\" said Margaret. \"I don t\nknow what to do. It isn t my house, and though Mr. Wilcox would have\nbeen glad to see you at any other time--as I say, I don t know what\nto do, but I undertake to do what I can for you. Helen, offer them\nsomething. Do try a sandwich, Mrs. Bast.\"\n\nThey moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing.\nIced cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne,\nremained almost intact; their overfed guests could do no more. Leonard\nrefused. Jacky thought she could manage a little. Margaret left them\nwhispering together, and had a few more words with Helen.\n\nShe said: \"Helen, I like Mr. Bast. I agree that he s worth helping. I\nagree that we are directly responsible.\"\n\n\"No, indirectly. Via Mr. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude, I ll\ndo nothing. No doubt you re right logically, and are entitled to say\na great many scathing things about Henry. Only, I won t have it. So\nchoose.\"\n\nHelen looked at the sunset.\n\n\"If you promise to take them quietly to the George I will speak to Henry\nabout them--in my own way, mind; there is to be none of this absurd\nscreaming about justice. I have no use for justice. If it was only a\nquestion of money, we could do it ourselves. But he wants work, and that\nwe can t give him, but possibly Henry can.\"\n\n\"It s his duty to,\" grumbled Helen.\n\n\"Nor am I concerned with duty. I m concerned with the characters of\nvarious people whom we know, and how, things being as they are, things\nmay be made a little better. Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours; all\nbusiness men do. But I am going to ask him, at the risk of a rebuff,\nbecause I want to make things a little better.\"\n\n\"Very well. I promise. You take it very calmly.\"\n\n\"Take them off to the George, then, and I ll try. Poor creatures! but\nthey look tired.\" As they parted, she added: \"I haven t nearly done with\nyou, though, Helen. You have been most self-indulgent. I can t get over\nit. You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older. Think it\nover and alter yourself, or we shan t have happy lives.\"\n\nShe rejoined Henry. Fortunately he had been sitting down: these physical\nmatters were important. \"Was it townees?\" he asked, greeting her with a\npleasant smile.\n\n\"You ll never believe me,\" said Margaret, sitting down beside him. \"It s\nall right now, but it was my sister.\"\n\n\"Helen here?\" he cried, preparing to rise. \"But she refused the\ninvitation. I thought hated weddings.\"\n\n\"Don t get up. She has not come to the wedding. I ve bundled her off to\nthe George.\"\n\nInherently hospitable, he protested.\n\n\"No; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them.\"\n\n\"Let  em all come.\"\n\n\"My dear Henry, did you see them?\"\n\n\"I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman, certainly.\"\n\n\"The brown bunch was Helen, but did you catch sight of a sea-green and\nsalmon bunch?\"\n\n\"What! are they out bean-feasting?\"\n\n\"No; business. They wanted to see me, and later on I want to talk to you\nabout them.\"\n\nShe was ashamed of her own diplomacy. In dealing with a Wilcox, how\ntempting it was to lapse from comradeship, and to give him the kind of\nwoman that he desired! Henry took the hint at once, and said: \"Why later\non? Tell me now. No time like the present.\"\n\n\"Shall I?\"\n\n\"If it isn t a long story.\"\n\n\"Oh, not five minutes; but there s a sting at the end of it, for I want\nyou to find the man some work in your office.\"\n\n\"What are his qualifications?\"\n\n\"I don t know. He s a clerk.\"\n\n\"How old?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five, perhaps.\"\n\n\"What s his name?\"\n\n\"Bast,\" said Margaret, and was about to remind him that they had met\nat Wickham Place, but stopped herself. It had not been a successful\nmeeting.\n\n\"Where was he before?\"\n\n\"Dempster s Bank.\"\n\n\"Why did he leave?\" he asked, still remembering nothing.\n\n\"They reduced their staff.\"\n\n\"All right; I ll see him.\"\n\nIt was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day. Now she\nunderstood why some women prefer influence to rights. Mrs. Plynlimmon,\nwhen condemning suffragettes, had said: \"The woman who can t influence\nher husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself.\"\n Margaret had winced, but she was influencing Henry now, and though\npleased at her little victory, she knew that she had won it by the\nmethods of the harem.\n\n\"I should be glad if you took him,\" she said, \"but I don t know whether\nhe s qualified.\"\n\n\"I ll do what I can. But, Margaret, this mustn t be taken as a\nprecedent.\"\n\n\"No, of course--of course--\"\n\n\"I can t fit in your proteges every day. Business would suffer.\"\n\n\"I can promise you he s the last. He--he s rather a special case.\"\n\n\"Proteges always are.\"\n\nShe let it stand at that. He rose with a little extra touch of\ncomplacency, and held out his hand to help her up. How wide the gulf\nbetween Henry as he was and Henry as Helen thought he ought to be! And\nshe herself--hovering as usual between the two, now accepting men as\nthey are, now yearning with her sister for Truth. Love and Truth--their\nwarfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it,\nand if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was\nreconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.\n\n\"Your protege has made us late,\" said he. \"The Fussells--will just be\nstarting.\"\n\nOn the whole she sided with men as they are. Henry would save the Basts\nas he had saved Howards End, while Helen and her friends were discussing\nthe ethics of salvation. His was a slap-dash method, but the world has\nbeen built slap-dash, and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset\nmay be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his\njoins. Oniton, like herself, was imperfect. Its apple-trees were\nstunted, its castle ruinous. It, too, had suffered in the border warfare\nbetween the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt, between things as they are and\nas they ought to be. Once more the west was retreating, once again the\norderly stars were dotting the eastern sky. There is certainly no rest\nfor us on the earth. But there is happiness, and as Margaret descended\nthe mound on her lover s arm, she felt that she was having her share.\n\nTo her annoyance, Mrs. Bast was still in the garden; the husband and\nHelen had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage\nrooms. Margaret found this woman repellent. She had felt, when shaking\nher hand, an overpowering shame. She remembered the motive of her call\nat Wickham Place, and smelt again odours from the abyss--odours the more\ndisturbing because they were involuntary. For there was no malice in\nJacky. There she sat, a piece of cake in one hand, an empty champagne\nglass in the other, doing no harm to anybody.\n\n\"She s overtired,\" Margaret whispered.\n\n\"She s something else,\" said Henry. \"This won t do. I can t have her in\nmy garden in this state.\"\n\n\"Is she--\" Margaret hesitated to add \"drunk.\" Now that she was going\nto marry him, he had grown particular. He discountenanced risque\nconversations now.\n\nHenry went up to the woman. She raised her face, which gleamed in the\ntwilight like a puff-ball.\n\n\"Madam, you will be more comfortable at the hotel,\" he said sharply.\n\nJacky replied: \"If it isn t Hen!\"\n\n\"Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble,\" apologised Margaret. \"Il est\ntout   fait diff rent.\"\n\n\"Henry!\" she repeated, quite distinctly.\n\nMr. Wilcox was much annoyed. \"I congratulate you on your proteges,\" he\nremarked.\n\n\"Hen, don t go. You do love me, dear, don t you?\"\n\n\"Bless us, what a person!\" sighed Margaret, gathering up her skirts.\n\nJacky pointed with her cake. \"You re a nice boy, you are.\" She yawned.\n\"There now, I love you.\"\n\n\"Henry, I am awfully sorry.\"\n\n\"And pray why?\" he asked, and looked at her so sternly that she feared\nhe was ill. He seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded.\n\n\"To have brought this down on you.\"\n\n\"Pray don t apologise.\"\n\nThe voice continued.\n\n\"Why does she call you  Hen ?\" said Margaret innocently. \"Has she ever\nseen you before?\"\n\n\"Seen Hen before!\" said Jacky. \"Who hasn t seen Hen? He s serving you\nlike me, my boys! You wait--Still we love  em.\"\n\n\"Are you now satisfied?\" Henry asked.\n\nMargaret began to grow frightened. \"I don t know what it is all about,\"\n she said. \"Let s come in.\"\n\nBut he thought she was acting. He thought he was trapped. He saw his\nwhole life crumbling. \"Don t you indeed?\" he said bitingly. \"I do. Allow\nme to congratulate you on the success of your plan.\"\n\n\"This is Helen s plan, not mine.\"\n\n\"I now understand your interest in the Basts. Very well thought out.\nI am amused at your caution, Margaret. You are quite right--it was\nnecessary. I am a man, and have lived a man s past. I have the honour to\nrelease you from your engagement.\"\n\nStill she could not understand. She knew of life s seamy side as a\ntheory; she could not grasp it as a fact. More words from Jacky were\nnecessary--words unequivocal, undenied.\n\n\"So that--\" burst from her, and she went indoors. She stopped herself\nfrom saying more.\n\n\"So what?\" asked Colonel Fussell, who was getting ready to start in the\nhall.\n\n\"We were saying--Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument, my\npoint being--\" Seizing his fur coat from a footman, she offered to help\nhim on. He protested, and there was a playful little scene.\n\n\"No, let me do that,\" said Henry, following.\n\n\"Thanks so much! You see--he has forgiven me!\"\n\nThe Colonel said gallantly: \"I don t expect there s much to forgive.\"\n\nHe got into the car. The ladies followed him after an interval.\nMaids, courier, and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the\nbranch-line. Still chattering, still thanking their host and patronising\ntheir future hostess, the guests were borne away.\n\nThen Margaret continued: \"So that woman has been your mistress?\"\n\n\"You put it with your usual delicacy,\" he replied.\n\n\"When, please?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"When, please?\"\n\n\"Ten years ago.\"\n\nShe left him without a word. For it was not her tragedy; it was Mrs.\nWilcox s.\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVII\n\nHelen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in\nmaking some people ill and others angry. Now that the wave of excitement\nwas ebbing, and had left her, Mr. Bast, and Mrs. Bast stranded for the\nnight in a Shropshire hotel, she asked herself what forces had made the\nwave flow. At all events, no harm was done. Margaret would play the game\nproperly now, and though Helen disapproved of her sister s methods, she\nknew that the Basts would benefit by them in the long-run.\n\n\"Mr. Wilcox is so illogical,\" she explained to Leonard, who had put his\nwife to bed, and was sitting with her in the empty coffee-room. \"If we\ntold him it was his duty to take you on, he might refuse to do it. The\nfact is, he isn t properly educated. I don t want to set you against\nhim, but you ll find him a trial.\"\n\n\"I can never thank you sufficiently, Miss Schlegel,\" was all that\nLeonard felt equal to.\n\n\"I believe in personal responsibility. Don t you? And in personal\neverything. I hate--I suppose I oughtn t to say that--but the Wilcoxes\nare on the wrong tack surely. Or perhaps it isn t their fault. Perhaps\nthe little thing that says  I  is missing out of the middle of their\nheads, and then it s a waste of time to blame them. There s a nightmare\nof a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the\nrest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that\nsays  I.  Had you heard that?\"\n\n\"I get no time for reading.\"\n\n\"Had you thought it, then? That there are two kinds of people--our kind,\nwho live straight from the middle of their heads, and the other kind\nwho can t, because their heads have no middle? They can t say  I.  They\nAREN T in fact, and so they re supermen. Pierpont Morgan has never said\n I  in his life.\"\n\nLeonard roused himself. If his benefactress wanted intellectual\nconversation, she must have it. She was more important than his ruined\npast. \"I never got on to Nietzsche,\" he said. \"But I always understood\nthat those supermen were rather what you may call egoists.\"\n\n\"Oh no, that s wrong,\" replied Helen. \"No superman ever said  I want, \nbecause  I want  must lead to the question,  Who am I?  and so to Pity\nand to Justice. He only says  want.   Want Europe,  if he s Napoleon;\n want wives,  if he s Bluebeard;  want Botticelli,  if he s Pierpont\nMorgan. Never the  I ; and if you could pierce through the superman,\nyou d find panic and emptiness in the middle.\"\n\nLeonard was silent for a moment. Then he said: \"May I take it, Miss\nSchlegel, that you and I are both the sort that say  I ?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And your sister, too?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" repeated Helen, a little sharply. She was annoyed with\nMargaret, but did not want her discussed. \"All presentable people say\n I. \"\n\n\"But Mr. Wilcox--he is not perhaps--\"\n\n\"I don t know that it s any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" he agreed. Helen asked herself why she had snubbed\nhim. Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise,\nand then had pulled him up short. Was she afraid of him presuming? If\nso, it was disgusting of her.\n\nBut he was thinking the snub quite natural. Everything she did was\nnatural, and incapable of causing offence. While the Miss Schlegels\nwere together he had felt them scarcely human--a sort of admonitory\nwhirligig. But a Miss Schlegel alone was different. She was in Helen s\ncase unmarried, in Margaret s about to be married, in neither case an\necho of her sister. A light had fallen at last into this rich upper\nworld, and he saw that it was full of men and women, some of whom were\nmore friendly to him than others. Helen had become \"his\" Miss Schlegel,\nwho scolded him and corresponded with him, and had swept down yesterday\nwith grateful vehemence. Margaret, though not unkind, was severe and\nremote. He would not presume to help her, for instance. He had never\nliked her, and began to think that his original impression was true,\nand that her sister did not like her either. Helen was certainly lonely.\nShe, who gave away so much, was receiving too little. Leonard was\npleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue\nand concealing what he knew about Mr. Wilcox. Jacky had announced her\ndiscovery when he fetched her from the lawn. After the first shock, he\ndid not mind for himself. By now he had no illusions about his wife, and\nthis was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been\npure. To keep perfection perfect, that should be his ideal, if the\nfuture gave him time to have ideals. Helen, and Margaret for Helen s\nsake, must not know.\n\nHelen disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife. \"Mrs.\nBast--does she ever say  I ?\" she asked, half mischievously, and then,\n\"Is she very tired?\"\n\n\"It s better she stops in her room,\" said Leonard.\n\n\"Shall I sit up with her?\"\n\n\"No, thank you; she does not need company.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bast, what kind of woman is your wife?\"\n\nLeonard blushed up to his eyes.\n\n\"You ought to know my ways by now. Does that question offend you?\"\n\n\"No, oh no, Miss Schlegel, no.\"\n\n\"Because I love honesty. Don t pretend your marriage has been a happy\none. You and she can have nothing in common.\"\n\nHe did not deny it, but said shyly: \"I suppose that s pretty obvious;\nbut Jacky never meant to do anybody any harm. When things went wrong,\nor I heard things, I used to think it was her fault, but, looking back,\nit s more mine. I needn t have married her, but as I have I must stick\nto her and keep her.\"\n\n\"How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Nearly three years.\"\n\n\"What did your people say?\"\n\n\"They will not have anything to do with us. They had a sort of family\ncouncil when they heard I was married, and cut us off altogether.\"\n\nHelen began to pace up and down the room. \"My good boy, what a mess!\"\n she said gently. \"Who are your people?\"\n\nHe could answer this. His parents, who were dead, had been in trade; his\nsisters had married commercial travellers; his brother was a lay-reader.\n\n\"And your grandparents?\"\n\nLeonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now. \"They\nwere just nothing at all,\" he said \"agricultural labourers and that\nsort.\"\n\n\"So! From which part?\"\n\n\"Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother s father--he, oddly enough, came\nfrom these parts round here.\"\n\n\"From this very Shropshire. Yes, that is odd. My mother s people were\nLancashire. But why do your brother and your sisters object to Mrs.\nBast?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don t know.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, you do know. I am not a baby. I can bear anything you tell\nme, and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help. Have they\nheard anything against her?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"I think I have guessed now,\" said Helen very gravely.\n\n\"I don t think so, Miss Schlegel; I hope not.\"\n\n\"We must be honest, even over these things. I have guessed. I am\nfrightfully, dreadfully sorry, but it does not make the least difference\nto me. I shall feel just the same to both of you. I blame, not your wife\nfor these things, but men.\"\n\nLeonard left it at that--so long as she did not guess the man. She stood\nat the window and slowly pulled up the blinds. The hotel looked over a\ndark square. The mists had begun. When she turned back to him her eyes\nwere shining. \"Don t you worry,\" he pleaded. \"I can t bear that. We\nshall be all right if I get work. If I could only get work--something\nregular to do. Then it wouldn t be so bad again. I don t trouble after\nbooks as I used. I can imagine that with regular work we should settle\ndown again. It stops one thinking.\"\n\n\"Settle down to what?\"\n\n\"Oh, just settle down.\"\n\n\"And that s to be life!\" said Helen, with a catch in her throat. \"How\ncan you, with all the beautiful things to see and do--with music--with\nwalking at night--\"\n\n\"Walking is well enough when a man s in work,\" he answered. \"Oh, I did\ntalk a lot of nonsense once, but there s nothing like a bailiff in the\nhouse to drive it out of you. When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and\nStevensons, I seemed to see life straight and real, and it isn t a\npretty sight. My books are back again, thanks to you, but they ll never\nbe the same to me again, and I shan t ever again think night in the\nwoods is wonderful.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Helen, throwing up the window.\n\n\"Because I see one must have money.\"\n\n\"Well, you re wrong.\"\n\n\"I wish I was wrong, but--the clergyman--he has money of his own, or\nelse he s paid; the poet or the musician--just the same; the tramp--he s\nno different. The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end, and is paid\nfor with other people s money. Miss Schlegel, the real thing s money, and\nall the rest is a dream.\"\n\n\"You re still wrong. You ve forgotten Death.\"\n\nLeonard could not understand.\n\n\"If we lived forever, what you say would be true. But we have to die,\nwe have to leave life presently. Injustice and greed would be the real\nthing if we lived for ever. As it is, we must hold to other things,\nbecause Death is coming. I love Death--not morbidly, but because He\nexplains. He shows me the emptiness of Money. Death and Money are the\neternal foes. Not Death and Life. Never mind what lies behind Death, Mr.\nBast, but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be\nhappier in it than the man who has never learnt to say,  I am I. \"\n\n\"I wonder.\"\n\n\"We are all in a mist--I know, but I can help you this far--men like\nthe Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any. Sane, sound Englishmen!\nbuilding up empires, levelling all the world into what they call common\nsense. But mention Death to them and they re offended, because Death s\nreally Imperial, and He cries out against them for ever.\"\n\n\"I am as afraid of Death as any one.\"\n\n\"But not of the idea of Death.\"\n\n\"But what is the difference?\"\n\n\"Infinite difference,\" said Helen, more gravely than before.\n\nLeonard looked at her wondering, and had the sense of great things\nsweeping out of the shrouded night. But he could not receive them,\nbecause his heart was still full of little things. As the lost umbrella\nhad spoilt the concert at Queen s Hall, so the lost situation was\nobscuring the diviner harmonies now. Death, Life, and Materialism were\nfine words, but would Mr. Wilcox take him on as a clerk? Talk as one\nwould, Mr. Wilcox was king of this world, the superman, with his own\nmorality, whose head remained in the clouds.\n\n\"I must be stupid,\" he said apologetically.\n\nWhile to Helen the paradox became clearer and clearer. \"Death destroys a\nman: the idea of Death saves him.\" Behind the coffins and the skeletons\nthat stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that\nis great in us responds to it. Men of the world may recoil from the\ncharnel-house that they will one day enter, but Love knows better. Death\nis his foe, but his peer, and in their age-long struggle the thews of\nLove have been strengthened, and his vision cleared, until there is no\none who can stand against him.\n\n\"So never give in,\" continued the girl, and restated again and again the\nvague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible.\nHer excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard\nto the earth. Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her. Presently\nthe waitress entered and gave her a letter from Margaret. Another note,\naddressed to Leonard, was inside. They read them, listening to the\nmurmurings of the river.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXVIII\n\nFor many hours Margaret did nothing; then she controlled herself, and\nwrote some letters. She was too bruised to speak to Henry; she could\npity him, and even determine to marry him, but as yet all lay too deep\nin her heart for speech. On the surface the sense of his degradation was\ntoo strong. She could not command voice or look, and the gentle words\nthat she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other\nperson.\n\n\"My dearest boy,\" she began, \"this is not to part us. It is everything\nor nothing, and I mean it to be nothing. It happened long before we ever\nmet, and even if it had happened since, I should be writing the same, I\nhope. I do understand.\"\n\nBut she crossed out \"I do understand\"; it struck a false note. Henry\ncould not bear to be understood. She also crossed out, \"It is everything\nor nothing.\" Henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She\nmust not comment; comment is unfeminine.\n\n\"I think that ll about do,\" she thought.\n\nThen the sense of his degradation choked her. Was he worth all this\nbother? To have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything, yes,\nit was, and she could not be his wife. She tried to translate his\ntemptation into her own language, and her brain reeled. Men must be\ndifferent even to want to yield to such a temptation. Her belief in\ncomradeship was stifled, and she saw life as from that glass saloon on\nthe Great Western which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh\nair. Are the sexes really races, each with its own code of morality, and\ntheir mutual love a mere device of Nature to keep things going? Strip\nhuman intercourse of the proprieties, and is it reduced to this? Her\njudgment told her no. She knew that out of Nature s device we have built\na magic that will win us immortality. Far more mysterious than the call\nof sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call; far wider\nis the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and\nthe garbage that nourishes it. We are evolving, in ways that Science\ncannot measure, to ends that Theology dares not contemplate. \"Men\ndid produce one jewel,\" the gods will say, and, saying, will give us\nimmortality. Margaret knew all this, but for the moment she could not\nfeel it, and transformed the marriage of Evie and Mr. Cahill into a\ncarnival of fools, and her own marriage--too miserable to think of that,\nshe tore up the letter, and then wrote another:\n\n\n\"DEAR MR. BAST,\"\n\n\"I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you, as I promised, and am sorry to\nsay that he has no vacancy for you.\"\n\n\"Yours truly,\"\n\n\"M. J. SCHLEGEL.\"\n\n\nShe enclosed this in a note to Helen, over which she took less trouble\nthan she might have done; but her head was aching, and she could not\nstop to pick her words:\n\n\n\"DEAR HELEN,\"\n\n\"Give him this. The Basts are no good. Henry found the woman drunk on\nthe lawn. I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please\ncome round at once on getting this? The Basts are not at all the type we\nshould trouble about. I may go round to them myself in the morning, and\ndo anything that is fair.\"\n\n\"M.\"\n\n\nIn writing this, Margaret felt that she was being practical. Something\nmight be arranged for the Basts later on, but they must be silenced\nfor the moment. She hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman\nand Helen. She rang the bell for a servant, but no one answered it;\nMr. Wilcox and the Warringtons were gone to bed, and the kitchen was\nabandoned to Saturnalia. Consequently she went over to the George\nherself. She did not enter the hotel, for discussion would have been\nperilous, and, saying that the letter was important, she gave it to the\nwaitress. As she recrossed the square she saw Helen and Mr. Bast looking\nout of the window of the coffee-room, and feared she was already too\nlate. Her task was not yet over; she ought to tell Henry what she had\ndone.\n\nThis came easily, for she saw him in the hall. The night wind had been\nrattling the pictures against the wall, and the noise had disturbed him.\n\n\"Who s there?\" he called, quite the householder.\n\nMargaret walked in and past him.\n\n\"I have asked Helen to sleep,\" she said. \"She is best here; so don t\nlock the front-door.\"\n\n\"I thought some one had got in,\" said Henry.\n\n\"At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him. I\ndon t know about later, but now the Basts must clearly go.\"\n\n\"Did you say that your sister is sleeping here, after all?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"Is she to be shown up to your room?\"\n\n\"I have naturally nothing to say to her; I am going to bed. Will you\ntell the servants about Helen? Could some one go to carry her bag?\"\n\nHe tapped a little gong, which had been bought to summon the servants.\n\n\"You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear.\"\n\nHenry opened a door, and down the corridor came shouts of laughter. \"Far\ntoo much screaming there,\" he said, and strode towards it. Margaret went\nupstairs, uncertain whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry. They\nhad behaved as if nothing had happened, and her deepest instincts told\nher that this was wrong. For his own sake, some explanation was due.\n\nAnd yet--what could an explanation tell her? A date, a place, a few\ndetails, which she could imagine all too clearly. Now that the first\nshock was over, she saw that there was every reason to premise a Mrs.\nBast. Henry s inner life had long laid open to her--his intellectual\nconfusion, his obtuseness to personal influence, his strong but furtive\npassions. Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded?\nPerhaps. Perhaps, if the dishonour had been done to her, but it was done\nlong before her day. She struggled against the feeling. She told herself\nthat Mrs. Wilcox s wrong was her own. But she was not a barren theorist.\nAs she undressed, her anger, her regard for the dead, her desire for a\nscene, all grew weak. Henry must have it as he liked, for she loved him,\nand some day she would use her love to make him a better man.\n\nPity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis. Pity, if\none may generalise, is at the bottom of woman. When men like us, it is\nfor our better qualities, and however tender their liking, we dare not\nbe unworthy of it, or they will quietly let us go. But unworthiness\nstimulates woman. It brings out her deeper nature, for good or for evil.\n\nHere was the core of the question. Henry must be forgiven, and made\nbetter by love; nothing else mattered. Mrs. Wilcox, that unquiet yet\nkindly ghost, must be left to her own wrong. To her everything was in\nproportion now, and she, too, would pity the man who was blundering\nup and down their lives. Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his trespass? An\ninteresting question, but Margaret fell asleep, tethered by affection,\nand lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from\nWales. She felt herself at one with her future home, colouring it and\ncoloured by it, and awoke to see, for the second time, Oniton Castle\nconquering the morning mists.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXIX\n\n\"Henry dear--\" was her greeting.\n\nHe had finished his breakfast, and was beginning the Times. His\nsister-in-law was packing. Margaret knelt by him and took the paper from\nhim, feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick. Then, putting her\nface where it had been, she looked up in his eyes.\n\n\"Henry dear, look at me. No, I won t have you shirking. Look at me.\nThere. That s all.\"\n\n\"You re referring to last evening,\" he said huskily. \"I have released\nyou from your engagement. I could find excuses, but I won t. No, I\nwon t. A thousand times no. I m a bad lot, and must be left at that.\"\n\nExpelled from his old fortress, Mr. Wilcox was building a new one.\nHe could no longer appear respectable to her, so he defended himself\ninstead in a lurid past. It was not true repentance.\n\n\"Leave it where you will, boy. It s not going to trouble us; I know what\nI m talking about, and it will make no difference.\"\n\n\"No difference?\" he inquired. \"No difference, when you find that I am\nnot the fellow you thought?\" He was annoyed with Miss Schlegel here. He\nwould have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow, or even to\nrage. Against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not\naltogether womanly. Her eyes gazed too straight; they had read books\nthat are suitable for men only. And though he had dreaded a scene, and\nthough she had determined against one, there was a scene, all the same.\nIt was somehow imperative.\n\n\"I am unworthy of you,\" he began. \"Had I been worthy, I should not have\nreleased you from your engagement. I know what I am talking about. I\ncan t bear to talk of such things. We had better leave it.\"\n\nShe kissed his hand. He jerked it from her, and, rising to his feet,\nwent on: \"You, with your sheltered life, and refined pursuits, and\nfriends, and books, you and your sister, and women like you--I say, how\ncan you guess the temptations that lie round a man?\"\n\n\"It is difficult for us,\" said Margaret; \"but if we are worth marrying,\nwe do guess.\"\n\n\"Cut off from decent society and family ties, what do you suppose\nhappens to thousands of young fellows overseas? Isolated. No one near. I\nknow by bitter experience, and yet you say it makes  no difference. \"\n\n\"Not to me.\"\n\nHe laughed bitterly. Margaret went to the sideboard and helped herself\nto one of the breakfast dishes. Being the last down, she turned out the\nspirit-lamp that kept them warm. She was tender, but grave. She knew\nthat Henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf\nbetween the male soul and the female, and she did not desire to hear him\non this point.\n\n\"Did Helen come?\" she asked.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"But that won t do at all, at all! We don t want her gossiping with Mrs.\nBast.\"\n\n\"Good God! no!\" he exclaimed, suddenly natural. Then he caught himself\nup. \"Let them gossip, my game s up, though I thank you for your\nunselfishness--little as my thanks are worth.\"\n\n\"Didn t she send me a message or anything?\"\n\n\"I heard of none.\"\n\n\"Would you ring the bell, please?\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"Why, to inquire.\"\n\nHe swaggered up to it tragically, and sounded a peal. Margaret poured\nherself out some coffee. The butler came, and said that Miss Schlegel\nhad slept at the George, so far as he had heard. Should he go round to\nthe George?\n\n\"I ll go, thank you,\" said Margaret, and dismissed him.\n\n\"It is no good,\" said Henry. \"Those things leak out; you cannot stop a\nstory once it has started. I have known cases of other men--I despised\nthem once, I thought that I m different, I shall never be tempted. Oh,\nMargaret--\" He came and sat down near her, improvising emotion. She\ncould not bear to listen to him. \"We fellows all come to grief once in\nour time. Will you believe that? There are moments when the strongest\nman-- Let him who standeth, take heed lest he fall.  That s true,\nisn t it? If you knew all, you would excuse me. I was far from good\ninfluences--far even from England. I was very, very lonely, and longed\nfor a woman s voice. That s enough. I have told you too much already for\nyou to forgive me now.\"\n\n\"Yes, that s enough, dear.\"\n\n\"I have\"--he lowered his voice--\"I have been through hell.\"\n\nGravely she considered this claim. Had he? Had he suffered tortures of\nremorse, or had it been, \"There! that s over. Now for respectable life\nagain\"? The latter, if she read him rightly. A man who has been through\nhell does not boast of his virility. He is humble and hides it, if,\nindeed, it still exists. Only in legend does the sinner come forth\npenitent, but terrible, to conquer pure woman by his resistless power.\nHenry was anxious to be terrible, but had not got it in him. He was a\ngood average Englishman, who had slipped. The really culpable point--his\nfaithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox--never seemed to strike him. She longed to\nmention Mrs. Wilcox.\n\nAnd bit by bit the story was told her. It was a very simple story. Ten\nyears ago was the time, a garrison town in Cyprus the place. Now and\nthen he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him, and she\nanswered, \"I have already forgiven you, Henry.\" She chose her words\ncarefully, and so saved him from panic. She played the girl, until he\ncould rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world. When the\nbutler came to clear away, Henry was in a very different mood--asked\nthe fellow what he was in such a hurry for, complained of the noise last\nnight in the servants  hall. Margaret looked intently at the butler. He,\nas a handsome young man, was faintly attractive to her as a woman--an\nattraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible, yet the skies would\nhave fallen if she had mentioned it to Henry.\n\nOn her return from the George the building operations were complete, and\nthe old Henry fronted her, competent, cynical, and kind. He had made a\nclean breast, had been forgiven, and the great thing now was to forget\nhis failure, and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments.\nJacky rejoined Howards End and Dude Street, and the vermilion motor-car,\nand the Argentine Hard Dollars, and all the things and people for whom\nhe had never had much use and had less now. Their memory hampered him.\nHe could scarcely attend to Margaret, who brought back disquieting news\nfrom the George. Helen and her clients had gone.\n\n\"Well, let them go--the man and his wife, I mean, for the more we see of\nyour sister the better.\"\n\n\"But they have gone separately--Helen very early, the Basts just before\nI arrived. They have left no message. They have answered neither of my\nnotes. I don t like to think what it all means.\"\n\n\"What did you say in the notes?\"\n\n\"I told you last night.\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes! Dear, would you like one turn in the garden?\"\n\nMargaret took his arm. The beautiful weather soothed her. But the wheels\nof Evie s wedding were still at work, tossing the guests outwards as\ndeftly as they had drawn them in, and she could not be with him long. It\nhad been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury, whence he would\ngo north, and she back to London with the Warringtons. For a fraction of\ntime she was happy. Then her brain recommenced.\n\n\"I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George. Helen\nwould not have left unless she had heard something. I mismanaged that.\nIt is wretched. I ought to have parted her from that woman at once.\"\n\n\"Margaret!\" he exclaimed, loosing her arm impressively.\n\n\"Yes--yes, Henry?\"\n\n\"I am far from a saint--in fact, the reverse--but you have taken me, for\nbetter or worse. Bygones must be bygones. You have promised to forgive\nme. Margaret, a promise is a promise. Never mention that woman again.\"\n\n\"Except for some practical reason--never.\"\n\n\"Practical! You practical!\"\n\n\"Yes, I m practical,\" she murmured, stooping over the mowing-machine and\nplaying with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand.\n\nHe had silenced her, but her fears made him uneasy. Not for the first\ntime, he was threatened with blackmail. He was rich and supposed to be\nmoral; the Basts knew that he was not, and might find it profitable to\nhint as much.\n\n\"At all events, you mustn t worry,\" he said. \"This is a man s business.\"\n He thought intently. \"On no account mention it to anybody.\"\n\nMargaret flushed at advice so elementary, but he was really paving the\nway for a lie. If necessary he would deny that he had ever known Mrs.\nBast, and prosecute her for libel. Perhaps he never had known her. Here\nwas Margaret, who behaved as if he had not. There the house. Round them\nwere half a dozen gardeners, clearing up after his daughter s wedding.\nAll was so solid and spruce, that the past flew up out of sight like a\nspring-blind, leaving only the last five minutes unrolled.\n\nGlancing at these, he saw that the car would be round during the\nnext five, and plunged into action. Gongs were tapped, orders issued,\nMargaret was sent to dress, and the housemaid to sweep up the long\ntrickle of grass that she had left across the hall. As is Man to the\nUniverse, so was the mind of Mr. Wilcox to the minds of some men--a\nconcentrated light upon a tiny spot, a little Ten Minutes moving\nself-contained through its appointed years. No Pagan he, who lives for\nthe Now, and may be wiser than all philosophers. He lived for the five\nminutes that have past, and the five to come; he had the business mind.\n\nHow did he stand now, as his motor slipped out of Oniton and breasted\nthe great round hills? Margaret had heard a certain rumour, but was all\nright. She had forgiven him, God bless her, and he felt the manlier for\nit. Charles and Evie had not heard it, and never must hear. No more must\nPaul. Over his children he felt great tenderness, which he did not try\nto track to a cause; Mrs. Wilcox was too far back in his life. He did\nnot connect her with the sudden aching love that he felt for Evie. Poor\nlittle Evie! he trusted that Cahill would make her a decent husband.\n\nAnd Margaret? How did she stand?\n\nShe had several minor worries. Clearly her sister had heard something.\nShe dreaded meeting her in town. And she was anxious about Leonard, for\nwhom they certainly were responsible. Nor ought Mrs. Bast to starve. But\nthe main situation had not altered. She still loved Henry. His actions,\nnot his disposition, had disappointed her, and she could bear that. And\nshe loved her future home. Standing up in the car, just where she had\nleapt from it two days before, she gazed back with deep emotion upon\nOniton. Besides the Grange and the Castle keep, she could now pick out\nthe church and the black-and-white gables of the George. There was the\nbridge, and the river nibbling its green peninsula. She could even\nsee the bathing-shed, but while she was looking for Charles s new\nspring-board, the forehead of the hill rose and hid the whole scene.\n\nShe never saw it again. Day and night the river flows down into England,\nday after day the sun retreats into the Welsh mountains, and the tower\nchimes, See the Conquering Hero. But the Wilcoxes have no part in the\nplace, nor in any place. It is not their names that recur in the parish\nregister. It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening.\nThey have swept into the valley and swept out of it, leaving a little\ndust and a little money behind.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXX\n\nTibby was now approaching his last year at Oxford. He had moved out of\ncollege, and was contemplating the Universe, or such portions of it as\nconcerned him, from his comfortable lodgings in Long Wall. He was not\nconcerned with much. When a young man is untroubled by passions and\nsincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily\nlimited. Tibby wished neither to strengthen the position of the rich nor\nto improve that of the poor, and so was well content to watch the elms\nnodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of Magdalen. There are\nworse lives. Though selfish, he was never cruel; though affected\nin manner, he never posed. Like Margaret, he disdained the heroic\nequipment, and it was only after many visits that men discovered\nSchlegel to possess a character and a brain. He had done well in Mods,\nmuch to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper\nexercise, and was now glancing disdainfully at Chinese in case he\nshould some day consent to qualify as a Student Interpreter. To him thus\nemployed Helen entered. A telegram had preceded her.\n\nHe noticed, in a distant way, that his sister had altered.\n\nAs a rule he found her too pronounced, and had never come across this\nlook of appeal, pathetic yet dignified--the look of a sailor who has\nlost everything at sea.\n\n\"I have come from Oniton,\" she began. \"There has been a great deal of\ntrouble there.\"\n\n\"Who s for lunch?\" said Tibby, picking up the claret, which was warming\nin the hearth. Helen sat down submissively at the table. \"Why such an\nearly start?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sunrise or something--when I could get away.\"\n\n\"So I surmise. Why?\"\n\n\"I don t know what s to be done, Tibby. I am very much upset at a piece\nof news that concerns Meg, and do not want to face her, and I am not\ngoing back to Wickham Place. I stopped here to tell you this.\"\n\nThe landlady came in with the cutlets. Tibby put a marker in the leaves\nof his Chinese Grammar and helped them. Oxford--the Oxford of the\nvacation--dreamed and rustled outside, and indoors the little fire was\ncoated with grey where the sunshine touched it. Helen continued her odd\nstory.\n\n\"Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone. I mean to go to\nMunich or else Bonn.\"\n\n\"Such a message is easily given,\" said her brother.\n\n\"As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture, you and she are\nto do exactly as you like. My own feeling is that everything may just as\nwell be sold. What does one want with dusty economic books, which have\nmade the world no better, or with mother s hideous chiffoniers? I have\nalso another commission for you. I want you to deliver a letter.\" She\ngot up. \"I haven t written it yet. Why shouldn t I post it, though?\" She\nsat down again. \"My head is rather wretched. I hope that none of your\nfriends are likely to come in.\"\n\nTibby locked the door. His friends often found it in this condition.\nThen he asked whether anything had gone wrong at Evie s wedding.\n\n\"Not there,\" said Helen, and burst into tears.\n\nHe had known her hysterical--it was one of her aspects with which he had\nno concern--and yet these tears touched him as something unusual. They\nwere nearer the things that did concern him, such as music. He laid down\nhis knife and looked at her curiously. Then, as she continued to sob, he\nwent on with his lunch.\n\nThe time came for the second course, and she was still crying. Apple\nCharlotte was to follow, which spoils by waiting. \"Do you mind Mrs.\nMartlett coming in?\" he asked, \"or shall I take it from her at the\ndoor?\"\n\n\"Could I bathe my eyes, Tibby?\"\n\nHe took her to his bedroom, and introduced the pudding in her absence.\nHaving helped himself, he put it down to warm in the hearth. His hand\nstretched towards the Grammar, and soon he was turning over the pages,\nraising his eyebrows scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at\nChinese. To him thus employed Helen returned. She had pulled herself\ntogether, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes.\n\n\"Now for the explanation,\" she said. \"Why didn t I begin with it? I\nhave found out something about Mr. Wilcox. He has behaved very wrongly\nindeed, and ruined two people s lives. It all came on me very suddenly\nlast night; I am very much upset, and I do not know what to do. Mrs.\nBast--\"\n\n\"Oh, those people!\"\n\nHelen seemed silenced.\n\n\"Shall I lock the door again?\"\n\n\"No thanks, Tibbikins. You re being very good to me. I want to tell you\nthe story before I go abroad, you must do exactly what you like--treat\nit as part of the furniture. Meg cannot have heard it yet, I think. But\nI cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has\nmisconducted himself. I don t even know whether she ought to be told.\nKnowing as she does that I dislike him, she will suspect me, and think\nthat I want to ruin her match. I simply don t know what to make of such\na thing. I trust your judgment. What would you do?\"\n\n\"I gather he has had a mistress,\" said Tibby.\n\nHelen flushed with shame and anger. \"And ruined two people s lives. And\ngoes about saying that personal actions count for nothing, and there\nalways will be rich and poor. He met her when he was trying to get rich\nout in Cyprus--I don t wish to make him worse than he is, and no doubt\nshe was ready enough to meet him. But there it is. They met. He goes his\nway and she goes hers. What do you suppose is the end of such women?\"\n\nHe conceded that it was a bad business.\n\n\"They end in two ways: Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the\nworkhouses are full of them, and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to\nthe papers complaining of our national degeneracy, or else they entrap a\nboy into marriage before it is too late. She--I can t blame her.\"\n\n\"But this isn t all,\" she continued after a long pause, during which the\nlandlady served them with coffee. \"I come now to the business that took\nus to Oniton. We went all three. Acting on Mr. Wilcox s advice, the man\nthrows up a secure situation and takes an insecure one, from which he is\ndismissed. There are certain excuses, but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to\nblame, as Meg herself admitted. It is only common justice that he should\nemploy the man himself. But he meets the woman, and, like the cur that\nhe is, he refuses, and tries to get rid of them. He makes Meg write.\nTwo notes came from her late that evening--one for me, one for Leonard,\ndismissing him with barely a reason. I couldn t understand. Then it\ncomes out that Mrs. Bast had spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we\nleft her to get rooms, and was still speaking about him when Leonard\ncame back to her. This Leonard knew all along. He thought it natural he\nshould be ruined twice. Natural! Could you have contained yourself?\"\n\n\"It is certainly a very bad business,\" said Tibby.\n\nHis reply seemed to calm his sister. \"I was afraid that I saw it out of\nproportion. But you are right outside it, and you must know. In a day or\ntwo--or perhaps a week--take whatever steps you think fit. I leave it in\nyour hands.\"\n\nShe concluded her charge.\n\n\"The facts as they touch Meg are all before you,\" she added; and Tibby\nsighed and felt it rather hard that, because of his open mind, he should\nbe empanelled to serve as a juror. He had never been interested in human\nbeings, for which one must blame him, but he had had rather too much of\nthem at Wickham Place. Just as some people cease to attend when books\nare mentioned, so Tibby s attention wandered when \"personal relations\"\n came under discussion. Ought Margaret to know what Helen knew the Basts\nto know? Similar questions had vexed him from infancy, and at Oxford he\nhad learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly\noverrated by specialists. The epigram, with its faint whiff of the\neighties, meant nothing. But he might have let it off now if his sister\nhad not been ceaselessly beautiful.\n\n\"You see, Helen--have a cigarette--I don t see what I m to do.\"\n\n\"Then there s nothing to be done. I dare say you are right. Let them\nmarry. There remains the question of compensation.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to adjudicate that too? Had you not better consult an\nexpert?\"\n\n\"This part is in confidence,\" said Helen. \"It has nothing to do with\nMeg, and do not mention it to her. The compensation--I do not see who is\nto pay it if I don t, and I have already decided on the minimum sum.\nAs soon as possible I am placing it to your account, and when I am in\nGermany you will pay it over for me. I shall never forget your kindness,\nTibbikins, if you do this.\"\n\n\"What is the sum?\"\n\n\"Five thousand.\"\n\n\"Good God alive!\" said Tibby, and went crimson.\n\n\"Now, what is the good of driblets? To go through life having done one\nthing--to have raised one person from the abyss; not these puny gifts of\nshillings and blankets--making the grey more grey. No doubt people will\nthink me extraordinary.\"\n\n\"I don t care an iota what people think!\" cried he, heated to unusual\nmanliness of diction. \"But it s half what you have.\"\n\n\"Not nearly half.\" She spread out her hands over her soiled skirt. \"I\nhave far too much, and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three\nhundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet. What I give will\nbring in a hundred and fifty between two. It isn t enough.\" He could not\nrecover. He was not angry or even shocked, and he saw that Helen would\nstill have plenty to live on. But it amazed him to think what haycocks\npeople can make of their lives. His delicate intonations would not work,\nand he could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a\ngreat deal of bother for him personally.\n\n\"I didn t expect you to understand me.\"\n\n\"I? I understand nobody.\"\n\n\"But you ll do it?\"\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I leave you two commissions, then. The first concerns Mr. Wilcox, and\nyou are to use your discretion. The second concerns the money, and is\nto be mentioned to no one, and carried out literally. You will send a\nhundred pounds on account to-morrow.\"\n\nHe walked with her to the station, passing through those streets whose\nserried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued. The lovely\ncreature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue, and only\nthe ganglion of vulgarity round Carfax showed how evanescent was the\nphantom, how faint its claim to represent England. Helen, rehearsing her\ncommission, noticed nothing; the Basts were in her brain, and she retold\nthe crisis in a meditative way, which might have made other men curious.\nShe was seeing whether it would hold. He asked her once why she had\ntaken the Basts right into the heart of Evie s wedding. She stopped like\na frightened animal and said, \"Does that seem to you so odd?\" Her eyes,\nthe hand laid on the mouth, quite haunted him, until they were absorbed\ninto the figure of St. Mary the Virgin, before whom he paused for a\nmoment on the walk home.\n\nIt is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties. Margaret\nsummoned him the next day. She was terrified at Helen s flight, and he\nhad to say that she had called in at Oxford. Then she said: \"Did she\nseem worried at any rumour about Henry?\" He answered, \"Yes.\" \"I knew it\nwas that!\" she exclaimed. \"I ll write to her.\" Tibby was relieved.\n\nHe then sent the cheque to the address that Helen gave him, and stated\nthat he was instructed to forward later on five thousand pounds. An\nanswer came back very civil and quiet in tone--such an answer as Tibby\nhimself would have given. The cheque was returned, the legacy refused,\nthe writer being in no need of money. Tibby forwarded this to Helen,\nadding in the fulness of his heart that Leonard Bast seemed somewhat a\nmonumental person after all. Helen s reply was frantic. He was to\ntake no notice. He was to go down at once and say that she commanded\nacceptance. He went. A scurf of books and china ornaments awaited him.\nThe Basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent, and had\nwandered no one knew whither. Helen had begun bungling with her money by\nthis time, and had even sold out her shares in the Nottingham and Derby\nRailway. For some weeks she did nothing. Then she reinvested, and, owing\nto the good advice of her stockbrokers, became rather richer than she\nhad been before.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXI\n\nHouses have their own ways of dying, falling as variously as the\ngenerations of men, some with a tragic roar, some quietly, but to an\nafter-life in the city of ghosts, while from others--and thus was the\ndeath of Wickham Place--the spirit slips before the body perishes. It\nhad decayed in the spring, disintegrating the girls more than they knew,\nand causing either to accost unfamiliar regions. By September it was a\ncorpse, void of emotion, and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty\nyears of happiness. Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture,\nand pictures, and books, until the last room was gutted and the last van\nhad rumbled away. It stood for a week or two longer, open-eyed, as if\nastonished at its own emptiness. Then it fell. Navvies came, and spilt\nit back into the grey. With their muscles and their beery good temper,\nthey were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been\nhuman, and had not mistaken culture for an end.\n\nThe furniture, with a few exceptions, went down into Hertfordshire, Mr.\nWilcox having most kindly offered Howards End as a warehouse. Mr. Bryce\nhad died abroad--an unsatisfactory affair--and as there seemed little\nguarantee that the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the\nagreement, and resumed possession himself. Until he relet the house, the\nSchlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower\nrooms. Margaret demurred, but Tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved\nhim from coming to any decision about the future. The plate and the\nmore valuable pictures found a safer home in London, but the bulk of the\nthings went country-ways, and were entrusted to the guardianship of Miss\nAvery.\n\nShortly before the move, our hero and heroine were married. They\nhave weathered the storm, and may reasonably expect peace. To have no\nillusions and yet to love--what stronger surety can a woman find? She\nhad seen her husband s past as well as his heart. She knew her own heart\nwith a thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible. The\nheart of Mrs. Wilcox was alone hidden, and perhaps it is superstitious\nto speculate on the feelings of the dead. They were married\nquietly--really quietly, for as the day approached she refused to go\nthrough another Oniton. Her brother gave her away, her aunt, who was\nout of health, presided over a few colourless refreshments. The Wilcoxes\nwere represented by Charles, who witnessed the marriage settlement, and\nby Mr. Cahill. Paul did send a cablegram. In a few minutes, and without\nthe aid of music, the clergyman made them man and wife, and soon the\nglass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world.\nShe, a monogamist, regretted the cessation of some of life s innocent\nodours; he, whose instincts were polygamous, felt morally braced by the\nchange and less liable to the temptations that had assailed him in the\npast.\n\nThey spent their honeymoon near Innsbruck. Henry knew of a reliable\nhotel there, and Margaret hoped for a meeting with her sister. In this\nshe was disappointed. As they came south, Helen retreated over the\nBrenner, and wrote an unsatisfactory post-card from the shores of the\nLake of Garda, saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be\nignored. Evidently she disliked meeting Henry. Two months are surely\nenough to accustom an outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted\nin two days, and Margaret had again to regret her sister s lack of\nself-control. In a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in\nsexual matters; so little is known about them; it is hard enough for\nthose who are personally touched to judge; then how futile must be the\nverdict of Society. \"I don t say there is no standard, for that would\ndestroy morality; only that there can be no standard until our impulses\nare classified and better understood.\" Helen thanked her for her kind\nletter--rather a curious reply. She moved south again, and spoke of\nwintering in Naples.\n\nMr. Wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed. Helen left him time to\ngrow skin over his wound. There were still moments when it pained him.\nHad he only known that Margaret was awaiting him--Margaret, so lively\nand intelligent, and yet so submissive--he would have kept himself\nworthier of her. Incapable of grouping the past, he confused the episode\nof Jacky with another episode that had taken place in the days of his\nbachelorhood. The two made one crop of wild oats, for which he was\nheartily sorry, and he could not see that those oats are of a darker\nstock which are rooted in another s dishonour. Unchastity and infidelity\nwere as confused to him as to the Middle Ages, his only moral teacher.\nRuth (poor old Ruth!) did not enter into his calculations at all, for\npoor old Ruth had never found him out.\n\nHis affection for his present wife grew steadily. Her cleverness gave\nhim no trouble, and, indeed, he liked to see her reading poetry or\nsomething about social questions; it distinguished her from the wives\nof other men. He had only to call, and she clapped the book up and was\nready to do what he wished. Then they would argue so jollily, and once\nor twice she had him in quite a tight corner, but as soon as he grew\nreally serious, she gave in. Man is for war, woman for the recreation\nof the warrior, but he does not dislike it if she makes a show of fight.\nShe cannot win in a real battle, having no muscles, only nerves.\nNerves make her jump out of a moving motor-car, or refuse to be\nmarried fashionably. The warrior may well allow her to triumph on such\noccasions; they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch\nhis peace.\n\nMargaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon. He told\nher--casually, as was his habit--that Oniton Grange was let. She showed\nher annoyance, and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted.\n\n\"I didn t want to bother you,\" he replied. \"Besides, I have only heard\nfor certain this morning.\"\n\n\"Where are we to live?\" said Margaret, trying to laugh. \"I loved the\nplace extraordinarily. Don t you believe in having a permanent home,\nHenry?\"\n\nHe assured her that she misunderstood him. It is home life that\ndistinguishes us from the foreigner. But he did not believe in a damp\nhome.\n\n\"This is news. I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp.\"\n\n\"My dear girl!\"--he flung out his hand--\"have you eyes? have you a skin?\nHow could it be anything but damp in such a situation? In the first\nplace, the Grange is on clay, and built where the castle moat must have\nbeen; then there s that detestable little river, steaming all night like\na kettle. Feel the cellar walls; look up under the eaves. Ask Sir James\nor any one. Those Shropshire valleys are notorious. The only possible\nplace for a house in Shropshire is on a hill; but, for my part, I think\nthe country is too far from London, and the scenery nothing special.\"\n\nMargaret could not resist saying, \"Why did you go there, then?\"\n\n\"I--because--\" He drew his head back and grew rather angry. \"Why have\nwe come to the Tyrol, if it comes to that? One might go on asking such\nquestions indefinitely.\"\n\nOne might; but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer. Out it\ncame, and he believed it as soon as it was spoken.\n\n\"The truth is, I took Oniton on account of Evie. Don t let this go any\nfurther.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"I shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad\nbargain. No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged. Poor\nlittle girl! She was so keen on it all, and wouldn t even wait to\nmake proper inquiries about the shooting. Afraid it would get snapped\nup--just like all of your sex. Well, no harm s done. She has had her\ncountry wedding, and I ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are\nstarting a preparatory school.\"\n\n\"Where shall we live, then, Henry? I should enjoy living somewhere.\"\n\n\"I have not yet decided. What about Norfolk?\"\n\nMargaret was silent. Marriage had not saved her from the sense of\nflux. London was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilisation which is\naltering human nature so profoundly, and throws upon personal\nrelations a stress greater than they have ever borne before. Under\ncosmopolitanism, if it comes, we shall receive no help from the earth.\nTrees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle, and the\nbinding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to\nLove alone. May Love be equal to the task!\n\n\"It is now what?\" continued Henry. \"Nearly October. Let us camp for the\nwinter at Ducie Street, and look out for something in the spring.\"\n\n\"If possible, something permanent. I can t be as young as I was, for\nthese alterations don t suit me.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, which would you rather have--alterations or rheumatism?\"\n\n\"I see your point,\" said Margaret, getting up. \"If Oniton is really\ndamp, it is impossible, and must be inhabited by little boys. Only, in\nthe spring, let us look before we leap. I will take warning by Evie,\nand not hurry you. Remember that you have a free hand this time.\nThese endless moves must be bad for the furniture, and are certainly\nexpensive.\"\n\n\"What a practical little woman it is! What s it been reading?\nTheo--theo--how much?\"\n\n\"Theosophy.\"\n\nSo Ducie Street was her first fate--a pleasant enough fate. The house,\nbeing only a little larger than Wickham Place, trained her for the\nimmense establishment that was promised in the spring. They were\nfrequently away, but at home life ran fairly regularly. In the\nmorning Henry went to business, and his sandwich--a relic this of some\nprehistoric craving--was always cut by her own hand. He did not rely\nupon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew\nhungry at eleven. When he had gone, there was the house to look after,\nand the servants to humanise, and several kettles of Helen s to keep on\nthe boil. Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts; she\nwas not sorry to have lost sight of them. No doubt Leonard was worth\nhelping, but being Henry s wife, she preferred to help some one else. As\nfor theatres and discussion societies, they attracted her less and\nless. She began to \"miss\" new movements, and to spend her spare time\nre-reading or thinking, rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends.\nThey attributed the change to her marriage, and perhaps some deep\ninstinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than\nwas inevitable. Yet the main cause lay deeper still; she had outgrown\nstimulants, and was passing from words to things. It was doubtless a\npity not to keep up with Wedekind or John, but some closing of the gates\nis inevitable after thirty, if the mind itself is to become a creative\npower.\n\n\n\n",

The wrong\npeople had tried to get in. The rector, as representing the older\ninhabitants, had said--Charles had said--the tax-collector had\nsaid--Charles had regretted not saying--and she closed the description\nwith, \"But lucky you, with four courts of your own at Midhurst.\"\n\n\"It will be very jolly,\" replied Margaret.\n\n\"Are those the plans? Does it matter my seeing them?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Charles has never seen the plans.\"\n\n\"They have only just arrived. Here is the ground floor--no, that s\nrather difficult. Try the elevation. We are to have a good many gables\nand a picturesque sky-line.\"\n\n\"What makes it smell so funny?\" said Dolly, after a moment s inspection.\nShe was incapable of understanding plans or maps.\n\n\"I suppose the paper.\"\n\n\"And WHICH way up is it?\"\n\n\"Just the ordinary way up. That s the sky-line and the part that smells\nstrongest is the sky.\"\n\n\"Well, ask me another. Margaret--oh--what was I going to say? How s\nHelen?\"\n\n\"Quite well.\"\n\n\"Is she never coming back to England? Every one thinks it s awfully odd\nshe doesn t.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Margaret, trying to conceal her vexation. She was\ngetting rather sore on this point. \"Helen is odd, awfully. She has now\nbeen away eight months.\"\n\n\"But hasn t she any address?\"\n\n\"A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address. Do write her a\nline. I will look it up for you.\"\n\n\"No, don t bother. That s eight months she has been away, surely?\"\n\n\"Exactly. She left just after Evie s wedding. It would be eight months.\"\n\n\"Just when baby was born, then?\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\nDolly sighed, and stared enviously round the drawing-room. She was\nbeginning to lose her brightness and good looks. The Charles s were not\nwell off, for Mr. Wilcox, having brought up his children with expensive\ntastes, believed in letting them shift for themselves. After all, he\nhad not treated them generously. Yet another baby was expected, she\ntold Margaret, and they would have to give up the motor. Margaret\nsympathised, but in a formal fashion, and Dolly little imagined that the\nstepmother was urging Mr. Wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance.\nShe sighed again, and at last the particular grievance was remembered.\n\"Oh, yes,\" she cried, \"that is it: Miss Avery has been unpacking your\npacking-cases.\"\n\n\"Why has she done that? How unnecessary!\"\n\n\"Ask another. I suppose you ordered her to.\"\n\n\"I gave no such orders. Perhaps she was airing the things. She did\nundertake to light an occasional fire.\"\n\n\"It was far more than an air,\" said Dolly solemnly. \"The floor sounds\ncovered with books. Charles sent me to know what is to be done, for he\nfeels certain you don t know.\"\n\n\"Books!\" cried Margaret, moved by the holy word. \"Dolly, are you\nserious? Has she been touching our books?\"\n\n\"Hasn t she, though! What used to be the hall s full of them. Charles\nthought for certain you knew of it.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Dolly. What can have come over Miss\nAvery? I must go down about it at once. Some of the books are my\nbrother s, and are quite valuable. She had no right to open any of the\ncases.\"\n\n\"I say she s dotty. She was the one that never got married, you know.\nOh, I say, perhaps, she thinks your books are wedding-presents to\nherself. Old maids are taken that way sometimes. Miss Avery hates us all\nlike poison ever since her frightful dust-up with Evie.\"\n\n\"I hadn t heard of that,\" said Margaret. A visit from Dolly had its\ncompensations.\n\n\"Didn t you know she gave Evie a present last August, and Evie returned\nit, and then--oh, goloshes! You never read such a letter as Miss Avery\nwrote.\"\n\n\"But it was wrong of Evie to return it. It wasn t like her to do such a\nheartless thing.\"\n\n\"But the present was so expensive.\"\n\n\"Why does that make any difference, Dolly?\"\n\n\"Still, when it costs over five pounds--I didn t see it, but it was\na lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop. You can t very well\naccept that kind of thing from a farm woman. Now, can you?\"\n\n\"You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married.\"\n\n\"Oh, mine was old earthenware stuff--not worth a halfpenny. Evie s was\nquite different. You d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you\na pendant like that. Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all\nsaid it was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a girl to\ndo? Evie didn t want to upset the old thing, so thought a sort of joking\nletter best, and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save Miss\nAvery trouble.\"\n\n\"But Miss Avery said--\"\n\nDolly s eyes grew round. \"It was a perfectly awful letter. Charles said\nit was the letter of a madman. In the end she had the pendant back again\nfrom the shop and threw it into the duck-pond.\"\n\n\"Did she give any reasons?\"\n\n\"We think she meant to be invited to Oniton, and so climb into society.\"\n\n\"She s rather old for that,\" said Margaret pensively. \"May she not have\ngiven the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother?\"\n\n\"That s a notion. Give every one their due, eh? Well, I suppose I ought\nto be toddling. Come along, Mr. Muff--you want a new coat, but I don t\nknow who ll give it you, I m sure;\" and addressing her apparel with\nmournful humour, Dolly moved from the room.\n\nMargaret followed her to ask whether Henry knew about Miss Avery s\nrudeness.\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"I wonder, then, why he let me ask her to look after the house.\"\n\n\"But she s only a farm woman,\" said Dolly, and her explanation proved\ncorrect. Henry only censured the lower classes when it suited him. He\nbore with Miss Avery as with Crane--because he could get good value out\nof them. \"I have patience with a man who knows his job,\" he would say,\nreally having patience with the job, and not the man. Paradoxical as it\nmay sound, he had something of the artist about him; he would pass over\nan insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his\nwife.\n\nMargaret judged it better to settle the little trouble herself. Parties\nwere evidently ruffled. With Henry s permission, she wrote a pleasant\nnote to Miss Avery, asking her to leave the cases untouched. Then, at\nthe first convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to\nrepack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse;\nthe plan had been amateurish and a failure. Tibby promised to accompany\nher, but at the last moment begged to be excused. So, for the second\ntime in her life, she entered the house alone.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXIII\n\nThe day of her visit was exquisite, and the last of unclouded happiness\nthat she was to have for many months. Her anxiety about Helen s\nextraordinary absence was still dormant, and as for a possible brush\nwith Miss Avery--that only gave zest to the expedition. She had also\neluded Dolly s invitation to luncheon. Walking straight up from the\nstation, she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut\navenue that connects it with the church. The church itself stood in the\nvillage once. But it there attracted so many worshippers that the\ndevil, in a pet, snatched it from its foundations, and poised it on\nan inconvenient knoll, three quarters of a mile away. If this story is\ntrue, the chestnut avenue must have been planted by the angels. No more\ntempting approach could be imagined for the lukewarm Christian, and if\nhe still finds the walk too long, the devil is defeated all the same,\nScience having built Holy Trinity, a Chapel of Ease, near the Charles s\nand roofed it with tin.\n\nUp the avenue Margaret strolled slowly, stopping to watch the sky that\ngleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts, or to finger the\nlittle horseshoes on the lower branches. Why has not England a great\nmythology? Our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness, and the\ngreater melodies about our country-side have all issued through the\npipes of Greece. Deep and true as the native imagination can be, it\nseems to have failed here. It has stopped with the witches and the\nfairies. It cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field, or give names\nto half a dozen stars. England still waits for the supreme moment of her\nliterature--for the great poet who shall voice her, or, better still for\nthe thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk.\n\nAt the church the scenery changed. The chestnut avenue opened into\na road, smooth but narrow, which led into the untouched country. She\nfollowed it for over a mile. Its little hesitations pleased her. Having\nno urgent destiny, it strolled downhill or up as it wished, taking\nno trouble about the gradients, or about the view, which nevertheless\nexpanded. The great estates that throttle the south of Hertfordshire\nwere less obtrusive here, and the appearance of the land was neither\naristocratic nor suburban. To define it was difficult, but Margaret knew\nwhat it was not: it was not snobbish. Though its contours were slight,\nthere was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which Surrey will never\nattain, and the distant brow of the Chilterns towered like a mountain.\n\"Left to itself,\" was Margaret s opinion, \"this county would vote\nLiberal.\" The comradeship, not passionate, that is our highest gift as\na nation, was promised by it, as by the low brick farm where she called\nfor the key.\n\nBut the inside of the farm was disappointing. A most finished young\nperson received her. \"Yes, Mrs. Wilcox; no, Mrs. Wilcox; oh yes, Mrs.\nWilcox, auntie received your letter quite duly. Auntie has gone up to\nyour little place at the present moment. Shall I send the servant to\ndirect you?\" Followed by: \"Of course, auntie does not generally look\nafter your place; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something\nexceptional. It gives her something to do. She spends quite a lot of her\ntime there. My husband says to me sometimes,  Where s auntie?  I say,\n Need you ask? She s at Howards End.  Yes, Mrs. Wilcox. Mrs. Wilcox,\ncould I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake? Not if I cut it for\nyou?\"\n\nMargaret refused the cake, but unfortunately this gave her gentility in\nthe eyes of Miss Avery s niece.\n\n\"I cannot let you go on alone. Now don t. You really mustn t. I\nwill direct you myself if it comes to that. I must get my hat.\nNow\"--roguishly--\"Mrs. Wilcox, don t you move while I m gone.\"\n\nStunned, Margaret did not move from the best parlour, over which the\ntouch of art nouveau had fallen. But the other rooms looked in keeping,\nthough they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had\nlived an elder race, to which we look back with disquietude. The country\nwhich we visit at week-ends was really a home to it, and the graver\nsides of life, the deaths, the partings, the yearnings for love,\nhave their deepest expression in the heart of the fields. All was not\nsadness. The sun was shining without. The thrush sang his two syllables\non the budding guelder-rose. Some children were playing uproariously\nin heaps of golden straw. It was the presence of sadness at all that\nsurprised Margaret, and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness.\nIn these English farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily and see\nit whole, group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth,\nconnect--connect without bitterness until all men are brothers. But her\nthoughts were interrupted by the return of Miss Avery s niece, and were\nso tranquillising that she suffered the interruption gladly.\n\nIt was quicker to go out by the back door, and, after due explanations,\nthey went out by it. The niece was now mortified by innumerable\nchickens, who rushed up to her feet for food, and by a shameless and\nmaternal sow. She did not know what animals were coming to. But her\ngentility withered at the touch of the sweet air. The wind was rising,\nscattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated\nin families over Evie s pendant. One of those delicious gales of spring,\nin which leaves still in bud seem to rustle, swept over the land and\nthen fell silent. \"Georgie,\" sang the thrush. \"Cuckoo,\" came furtively\nfrom the cliff of pine-trees. \"Georgie, pretty Georgie,\" and the other\nbirds joined in with nonsense. The hedge was a half-painted picture\nwhich would be finished in a few days. Celandines grew on its banks,\nlords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows; the wild\nrose-bushes, still bearing their withered hips, showed also the promise\nof blossom. Spring had come, clad in no classical garb, yet fairer\nthan all springs; fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of\nTuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind.\n\nThe two women walked up the lane full of outward civility. But Margaret\nwas thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such\na day, and the niece was thinking about hats. Thus engaged, they reached\nHowards End. Petulant cries of \"Auntie!\" severed the air. There was no\nreply, and the front door was locked.\n\n\"Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Mrs. Wilcox, quite sure. She is here daily.\"\n\nMargaret tried to look in through the dining-room window, but the\ncurtain inside was drawn tightly. So with the drawing-room and the hall.\nThe appearance of these curtains was familiar, yet she did not remember\ntheir being there on her other visit; her impression was that Mr. Bryce\nhad taken everything away. They tried the back. Here again they received\nno answer, and could see nothing; the kitchen-window was fitted with\na blind, while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up\nagainst them, which looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases.\nMargaret thought of her books, and she lifted up her voice also. At the\nfirst cry she succeeded.\n\n\"Well, well!\" replied some one inside the house. \"If it isn t Mrs.\nWilcox come at last!\"\n\n\"Have you got the key, auntie?\"\n\n\"Madge, go away,\" said Miss Avery, still invisible.\n\n\"Auntie, it s Mrs. Wilcox--\"\n\nMargaret supported her. \"Your niece and I have come together.\"\n\n\"Madge, go away. This is no moment for your hat.\"\n\nThe poor woman went red. \"Auntie gets more eccentric lately,\" she said\nnervously.\n\n\"Miss Avery!\" called Margaret. \"I have come about the furniture. Could\nyou kindly let me in?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Wilcox,\" said the voice, \"of course.\" But after that came\nsilence. They called again without response. They walked round the house\ndisconsolately.\n\n\"I hope Miss Avery is not ill,\" hazarded Margaret.\n\n\"Well, if you ll excuse me,\" said Madge, \"perhaps I ought to be leaving\nyou now. The servants need seeing to at the farm. Auntie is so odd at\ntimes.\" Gathering up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if\nher departure had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.\n\nMiss Avery said, \"Well, come right in, Mrs. Wilcox!\" quite pleasantly\nand calmly.\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" began Margaret, but broke off at the sight of an\numbrella-stand. It was her own.\n\n\"Come right into the hall first,\" said Miss Avery. She drew the curtain,\nand Margaret uttered a cry of despair. For an appalling thing had\nhappened. The hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from\nWickham Place. The carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up\nnear the window; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace,\nand her father s sword--this is what bewildered her particularly--had\nbeen drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes.\nMiss Avery must have worked for days.\n\n\"I m afraid this isn t what we meant,\" she began. \"Mr. Wilcox and I\nnever intended the cases to be touched. For instance, these books are my\nbrother s. We are storing them for him and for my sister, who is abroad.\nWhen you kindly undertook to look after things, we never expected you to\ndo so much.\"\n\n\"The house has been empty long enough,\" said the old woman.\n\nMargaret refused to argue. \"I dare say we didn t explain,\" she said\ncivilly. \"It has been a mistake, and very likely our mistake.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Wilcox, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years. The\nhouse is Mrs. Wilcox s, and she would not desire it to stand empty any\nlonger.\"\n\nTo help the poor decaying brain, Margaret said:\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Wilcox s house, the mother of Mr. Charles.\"\n\n\"Mistake upon mistake,\" said Miss Avery. \"Mistake upon mistake.\"\n\n\"Well, I don t know,\" said Margaret, sitting down in one of her own\nchairs. \"I really don t know what s to be done.\" She could not help\nlaughing.\n\nThe other said: \"Yes, it should be a merry house enough.\"\n\n\"I don t know--I dare say. Well, thank you very much, Miss Avery. Yes,\nthat s all right. Delightful.\"\n\n\"There is still the parlour.\" She went through the door opposite and\ndrew a curtain. Light flooded the drawing-room furniture from Wickham\nPlace. \"And the dining-room.\" More curtains were drawn, more windows\nwere flung open to the spring. \"Then through here--\" Miss Avery\ncontinued passing and reprising through the hall. Her voice was lost,\nbut Margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind. \"I ve not finished\nhere yet,\" she announced, returning. \"There s still a deal to do. The\nfarm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no need\nto go into expense at Hilton.\"\n\n\"It is all a mistake,\" repeated Margaret, feeling that she must put her\nfoot down. \"A misunderstanding. Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live\nat Howards End.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! On account of his hay fever?\"\n\n\"We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex, and part\nof this furniture--my part--will go down there presently.\" She looked at\nMiss Avery intently, trying to understand the kink in her brain.\n\nHere was no maundering old woman. Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous.\nShe looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious\nnobility. \"You think that you won t come back to live here, Mrs. Wilcox,\nbut you will.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Margaret, smiling. \"We have no intention\nof doing so for the present. We happen to need a much larger house.\nCircumstances oblige us to give big parties. Of course, some day--one\nnever knows, does one?\"\n\nMiss Avery retorted: \"Some day! Tcha! tcha! Don t talk about some day.\nYou are living here now.\"\n\n\"Am I?\"\n\n\"You are living here, and have been for the last ten minutes, if you ask\nme.\"\n\nIt was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of disloyalty\nMargaret rose from her chair. She felt that Henry had been obscurely\ncensured. They went into the dining-room, where the sunlight poured in\nupon her mother s chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped\nfrom a new niche. The furniture fitted extraordinarily well. In the\ncentral room--over the hall, the room that Helen had slept in four years\nago--Miss Avery had placed Tibby s old bassinette.\n\n\"The nursery,\" she said.\n\nMargaret turned away without speaking.\n\nAt last everything was seen. The kitchen and lobby were still stacked\nwith furniture and straw, but, as far as she could make out, nothing\nhad been broken or scratched. A pathetic display of ingenuity! Then they\ntook a friendly stroll in the garden. It had gone wild since her last\nvisit. The gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up at the very\njaws of the garage. And Evie s rockery was only bumps. Perhaps Evie was\nresponsible for Miss Avery s oddness. But Margaret suspected that the\ncause lay deeper, and that the girl s silly letter had but loosed the\nirritation of years.\n\n\"It s a beautiful meadow,\" she remarked. It was one of those open-air\ndrawing-rooms that have been formed, hundreds of years ago, out of the\nsmaller fields. So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right\nangles, and at the bottom there was a little green annex--a sort of\npowder-closet for the cows.\n\n\"Yes, the maidy s well enough,\" said Miss Avery, \"for those, that is,\nwho don t suffer from sneezing.\" And she cackled maliciously. \"I ve\nseen Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time--oh, they ought to do\nthis--they mustn t do that--he d learn them to be lads. And just then\nthe tickling took him. He has it from his father, with other things.\nThere s not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June--I\nlaughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth.\"\n\n\"My brother gets hay fever too,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"This house lies too much on the land for them. Naturally, they were\nglad enough to slip in at first. But Wilcoxes are better than nothing,\nas I see you ve found.\"\n\nMargaret laughed.\n\n\"They keep a place going, don t they? Yes, it is just that.\"\n\n\"They keep England going, it is my opinion.\"\n\nBut Miss Avery upset her by replying: \"Ay, they breed like rabbits.\nWell, well, it s a funny world. But He who made it knows what He wants\nin it, I suppose. If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth, it isn t for\nus to repine.\"\n\n\"They breed and they also work,\" said Margaret, conscious of some\ninvitation to disloyalty, which was echoed by the very breeze and by the\nsongs of the birds. \"It certainly is a funny world, but so long as men\nlike my husband and his sons govern it, I think it ll never be a bad\none--never really bad.\"\n\n\"No, better n nothing,\" said Miss Avery, and turned to the wych-elm.\n\nOn their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more\nclearly than before. In the house Margaret had wondered whether she\nquite distinguished the first wife from the second. Now she said: \"I\nnever saw much of Ruth after her grandmother died, but we stayed civil.\nIt was a very civil family. Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against\nanybody, nor let any one be turned away without food. Then it was never\n Trespassers will be prosecuted  in their land, but would people please\nnot come in? Mrs. Howard was never created to run a farm.\"\n\n\"Had they no men to help them?\" Margaret asked.\n\nMiss Avery replied: \"Things went on until there were no men.\"\n\n\"Until Mr. Wilcox came along,\" corrected Margaret, anxious that her\nhusband should receive his dues.\n\n\"I suppose so; but Ruth should have married a--no disrespect to you to\nsay this, for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way, whether\nshe got him first or no.\"\n\n\"Whom should she have married?\"\n\n\"A soldier!\" exclaimed the old woman. \"Some real soldier.\"\n\nMargaret was silent. It was a criticism of Henry s character far more\ntrenchant than any of her own. She felt dissatisfied.\n\n\"But that s all over,\" she went on. \"A better time is coming now, though\nyou ve kept me long enough waiting. In a couple of weeks I ll see your\nlight shining through the hedge of an evening. Have you ordered in\ncoals?\"\n\n\"We are not coming,\" said Margaret firmly. She respected Miss Avery too\nmuch to humour her. \"No. Not coming. Never coming. It has all been a\nmistake. The furniture must be repacked at once, and I am very sorry,\nbut I am making other arrangements, and must ask you to give me the\nkeys.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mrs. Wilcox,\" said Miss Avery, and resigned her duties with\na smile.\n\nRelieved at this conclusion, and having sent her compliments to Madge,\nMargaret walked back to the station. She had intended to go to the\nfurniture warehouse and give directions for removal, but the muddle had\nturned out more extensive than she expected, so she decided to consult\nHenry. It was as well that she did this. He was strongly against\nemploying the local man whom he had previously recommended, and advised\nher to store in London after all.\n\nBut before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXIV\n\nIt was not unexpected entirely. Aunt Juley s health had been bad all\nwinter. She had had a long series of colds and coughs, and had been too\nbusy to get rid of them. She had scarcely promised her niece \"to really\ntake my tiresome chest in hand,\" when she caught a chill and developed\nacute pneumonia. Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage. Helen was\ntelegraphed for, and that spring party that after all gathered in that\nhospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories. On a perfect day,\nwhen the sky seemed blue porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little\nbay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, Margaret hurried up through\nthe rhododendrons, confronted again by the senselessness of Death.\nOne death may explain itself, but it throws no light upon another; the\ngroping inquiry must begin anew. Preachers or scientists may generalise,\nbut we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love; not\none heaven awaits them, not even one oblivion. Aunt Juley, incapable of\ntragedy, slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for\nhaving stopped in it so long. She was very weak; she could not rise to\nthe occasion, or realise the great mystery which all agree must await\nher; it only seemed to her that she was quite done up--more done up\nthan ever before; that she saw and heard and felt less every moment; and\nthat, unless something changed, she would soon feel nothing. Her spare\nstrength she devoted to plans: could not Margaret take some steamer\nexpeditions? were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them? She worried\nherself about Helen s absence, and also that she should be the cause of\nHelen s return. The nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural,\nand perhaps hers was an average approach to the Great Gate. But Margaret\nsaw Death stripped of any false romance; whatever the idea of Death may\ncontain, the process can be trivial and hideous.\n\n\"Important--Margaret dear, take the Lulworth when Helen comes.\"\n\n\"Helen won t be able to stop, Aunt Juley. She has telegraphed that she\ncan only get away just to see you. She must go back to Germany as soon\nas you are well.\"\n\n\"How very odd of Helen! Mr. Wilcox--\"\n\n\"Yes, dear?\"\n\n\"Can he spare you?\"\n\nHenry wished her to come, and had been very kind. Yet again Margaret\nsaid so.\n\nMrs. Munt did not die. Quite outside her will, a more dignified power\ntook hold of her and checked her on the downward slope. She returned,\nwithout emotion, as fidgety as ever. On the fourth day she was out of\ndanger.\n\n\"Margaret--important,\" it went on: \"I should like you to have some\ncompanion to take walks with. Do try Miss Conder.\"\n\n\"I have been for a little walk with Miss Conder.\"\n\n\"But she is not really interesting. If only you had Helen.\"\n\n\"I have Tibby, Aunt Juley.\"\n\n\"No, but he has to do his Chinese. Some real companion is what you need.\nReally, Helen is odd.\"\n\n\"Helen is odd, very,\" agreed Margaret.\n\n\"Not content with going abroad, why does she want to go back there at\nonce?\"\n\n\"No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us. She has not the\nleast balance.\"\n\nThat was the stock criticism about Helen, but Margaret s voice trembled\nas she made it. By now she was deeply pained at her sister s behaviour.\nIt may be unbalanced to fly out of England, but to stay away eight\nmonths argues that the heart is awry as well as the head. A sick-bed\ncould recall Helen, but she was deaf to more human calls; after a\nglimpse at her aunt, she would retire into her nebulous life behind some\nposte restante. She scarcely existed; her letters had become dull and\ninfrequent; she had no wants and no curiosity. And it was all put down\nto poor Henry s account! Henry, long pardoned by his wife, was still too\ninfamous to be greeted by his sister-in-law. It was morbid, and, to her\nalarm, Margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity\nback in Helen s life for nearly four years. The flight from Oniton;\nthe unbalanced patronage of the Basts; the explosion of grief up on\nthe Downs--all connected with Paul, an insignificant boy whose lips had\nkissed hers for a fraction of time. Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox had feared\nthat they might kiss again. Foolishly--the real danger was reaction.\nReaction against the Wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was\nscarcely sane. At twenty-five she had an idee fixe. What hope was there\nfor her as an old woman?\n\nThe more Margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became. For many\nmonths she had put the subject away, but it was too big to be slighted\nnow. There was almost a taint of madness. Were all Helen s actions to be\ngoverned by a tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or\nwoman? Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant? The\nblundering little encounter at Howards End was vital. It propagated\nitself where graver intercourse lay barren; it was stronger than\nsisterly intimacy, stronger than reason or books. In one of her moods\nHelen had confessed that she still \"enjoyed\" it in a certain sense.\nPaul had faded, but the magic of his caress endured. And where there is\nenjoyment of the past there may also be reaction--propagation at both\nends.\n\nWell, it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed-beds, and\nwe without power to choose the seed. But man is an odd, sad creature as\nyet, intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within\nhimself. He cannot be bored about psychology. He leaves it to the\nspecialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a\nsteam-engine. He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul. Margaret\nand Helen have been more patient, and it is suggested that Margaret\nhas succeeded--so far as success is yet possible. She does understand\nherself, she has some rudimentary control over her own growth. Whether\nHelen has succeeded one cannot say.\n\nThe day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen s letter arrived. She had posted\nit at Munich, and would be in London herself on the morrow. It was a\ndisquieting letter, though the opening was affectionate and sane.\n\n\n\"DEAREST MEG,\n\n\"Give Helen s love to Aunt Juley. Tell her that I love, and have loved\nher ever since I can remember. I shall be in London Thursday.\n\n\"My address will be care of the bankers. I have not yet settled on a\nhotel, so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news. If Aunt\nJuley is much better, or if, for a terrible reason, it would be no good\nmy coming down to Swanage, you must not think it odd if I do not come.\nI have all sorts of plans in my head. I am living abroad at present, and\nwant to get back as quickly as possible. Will you please tell me where\nour furniture is? I should like to take out one or two books; the rest\nare for you.\n\n\"Forgive me, dearest Meg. This must read like rather a tiresome letter,\nbut all letters are from your loving\n\n\"HELEN.\"\n\n\nIt was a tiresome letter, for it tempted Margaret to tell a lie. If\nshe wrote that Aunt Juley was still in danger her sister would come.\nUnhealthiness is contagious. We cannot be in contact with those who are\nin a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating. To \"act for the best\"\n might do Helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the risk of\ndisaster, she kept her colours flying a little longer. She replied that\ntheir aunt was much better, and awaited developments.\n\nTibby approved of her reply. Mellowing rapidly, he was a pleasanter\ncompanion than before. Oxford had done much for him. He had lost his\npeevishness, and could hide his indifference to people and his interest\nin food. But he had not grown more human. The years between eighteen and\ntwenty-two, so magical for most, were leading him gently from boyhood to\nmiddle age. He had never known young-manliness, that quality which warms\nthe heart till death, and gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm. He\nwas frigid, through no fault of his own, and without cruelty. He thought\nHelen wrong and Margaret right, but the family trouble was for him what\na scene behind footlights is for most people. He had only one suggestion\nto make, and that was characteristic.\n\n\"Why don t you tell Mr. Wilcox?\"\n\n\"About Helen?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"He would do all he could, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, you know best. But he is practical.\"\n\nIt was the student s belief in experts. Margaret demurred for one or two\nreasons. Presently Helen s answer came. She sent a telegram requesting\nthe address of the furniture, as she would now return at once. Margaret\nreplied, \"Certainly not; meet me at the bankers  at four.\" She and Tibby\nwent up to London. Helen was not at the bankers , and they were refused\nher address. Helen had passed into chaos.\n\nMargaret put her arm round her brother. He was all that she had left,\nand never had he seemed more unsubstantial.\n\n\"Tibby love, what next?\"\n\nHe replied: \"It is extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Dear, your judgment s often clearer than mine. Have you any notion\nwhat s at the back?\"\n\n\"None, unless it s something mental.\"\n\n\"Oh--that!\" said Margaret. \"Quite impossible.\" But the suggestion had\nbeen uttered, and in a few minutes she took it up herself. Nothing else\nexplained. And London agreed with Tibby. The mask fell off the city, and\nshe saw it for what it really is--a caricature of infinity. The familiar\nbarriers, the streets along which she moved, the houses between which\nshe had made her little journeys for so many years, became negligible\nsuddenly. Helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the\nslowly-flowing slabs of mud. She had accomplished a hideous act of\nrenunciation and returned to the One. Margaret s own faith held firm.\nShe knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all, with the\nstars and the sea. Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for\nmany years. It was symbolic the catastrophe should come now, on a London\nafternoon, while rain fell slowly.\n\nHenry was the only hope. Henry was definite. He might know of some paths\nin the chaos that were hidden from them, and she determined to take\nTibby s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands. They must call at\nhis office. He could not well make it worse. She went for a few moments\ninto St. Paul s, whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely, as\nif preaching the gospel of form. But within, St. Paul s is as its\nsurroundings--echoes and whispers, inaudible songs, invisible mosaics,\nwet footmarks, crossing and recrossing the floor. Si monumentum\nrequiris, circumspice; it points us back to London. There was no hope of\nHelen here.\n\nHenry was unsatisfactory at first. That she had expected. He was\noverjoyed to see her back from Swanage, and slow to admit the growth of\na new trouble. When they told him of their search, he only chaffed Tibby\nand the Schlegels generally, and declared that it was \"just like Helen\"\n to lead her relatives a dance.\n\n\"That is what we all say,\" replied Margaret. \"But why should it be\njust like Helen? Why should she be allowed to be so queer, and to grow\nqueerer?\"\n\n\"Don t ask me. I m a plain man of business. I live and let live. My\nadvice to you both is, don t worry. Margaret, you ve got black marks\nagain under your eyes. You know that s strictly forbidden. First\nyour aunt--then your sister. No, we aren t going to have it. Are we,\nTheobald?\" He rang the bell. \"I ll give you some tea, and then you go\nstraight to Ducie Street. I can t have my girl looking as old as her\nhusband.\"\n\n\"All the same, you have not quite seen our point,\" said Tibby.\n\nMr. Wilcox, who was in good spirits, retorted, \"I don t suppose I ever\nshall.\" He leant back, laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family,\nwhile the fire flickered over the map of Africa. Margaret motioned to\nher brother to go on. Rather diffident, he obeyed her.\n\n\"Margaret s point is this,\" he said. \"Our sister may be mad.\"\n\nCharles, who was working in the inner room, looked round.\n\n\"Come in, Charles,\" said Margaret kindly. \"Could you help us at all? We\nare again in trouble.\"\n\n\"I m afraid I cannot. What are the facts? We are all mad more or less,\nyou know, in these days.\"\n\n\"The facts are as follows,\" replied Tibby, who had at times a pedantic\nlucidity. \"The facts are that she has been in England for three days and\nwill not see us. She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address.\nShe refuses to answer questions. Margaret finds her letters colourless.\nThere are other facts, but these are the most striking.\"\n\n\"She has never behaved like this before, then?\" asked Henry.\n\n\"Of course not!\" said his wife, with a frown.\n\n\"Well, my dear, how am I to know?\"\n\nA senseless spasm of annoyance came over her. \"You know quite well that\nHelen never sins against affection,\" she said. \"You must have noticed\nthat much in her, surely.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; she and I have always hit it off together.\"\n\n\"No, Henry--can t you see?--I don t mean that.\"\n\nShe recovered herself, but not before Charles had observed her. Stupid\nand attentive, he was watching the scene.\n\n\"I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past, one could trace\nit back to the heart in the long-run. She behaved oddly because she\ncared for some one, or wanted to help them. There s no possible excuse\nfor her now. She is grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure that\nshe is not well.  Mad  is too terrible a word, but she is not well.\nI shall never believe it. I shouldn t discuss my sister with you if I\nthought she was well--trouble you about her, I mean.\"\n\nHenry began to grow serious. Ill-health was to him something perfectly\ndefinite. Generally well himself, he could not realise that we sink to\nit by slow gradations. The sick had no rights; they were outside the\npale; one could lie to them remorselessly. When his first wife was\nseized, he had promised to take her down into Hertfordshire, but\nmeanwhile arranged with a nursing-home instead. Helen, too, was ill. And\nthe plan that he sketched out for her capture, clever and well-meaning\nas it was, drew its ethics from the wolf-pack.\n\n\"You want to get hold of her?\" he said. \"That s the problem, isn t it?\nShe has got to see a doctor.\"\n\n\"For all I know she has seen one already.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; don t interrupt.\" He rose to his feet and thought intently.\nThe genial, tentative host disappeared, and they saw instead the man who\nhad carved money out of Greece and Africa, and bought forests from the\nnatives for a few bottles of gin. \"I ve got it,\" he said at last. \"It s\nperfectly easy. Leave it to me. We ll send her down to Howards End.\"\n\n\"How will you do that?\"\n\n\"After her books. Tell her that she must unpack them herself. Then you\ncan meet her there.\"\n\n\"But, Henry, that s just what she won t let me do. It s part of\nher--whatever it is--never to see me.\"\n\n\"Of course you won t tell her you re going. When she is there, looking\nat the cases, you ll just stroll in. If nothing is wrong with her, so\nmuch the better. But there ll be the motor round the corner, and we can\nrun her to a specialist in no time.\"\n\nMargaret shook her head. \"It s quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It doesn t seem impossible to me,\" said Tibby; \"it is surely a very\ntippy plan.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, because--\" She looked at her husband sadly. \"It s not\nthe particular language that Helen and I talk, if you see my meaning. It\nwould do splendidly for other people, whom I don t blame.\"\n\n\"But Helen doesn t talk,\" said Tibby. \"That s our whole difficulty. She\nwon t talk your particular language, and on that account you think she s\nill.\"\n\n\"No, Henry; it s sweet of you, but I couldn t.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said; \"you have scruples.\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer. You\ncould have got her down to Swanage by a word, but you had scruples. And\nscruples are all very well. I am as scrupulous as any man alive, I hope;\nbut when it is a case like this, when there is a question of madness--\"\n\n\"I deny it s madness.\"\n\n\"You said just now--\"\n\n\"It s madness when I say it, but not when you say it.\"\n\nHenry shrugged his shoulders. \"Margaret! Margaret!\" he groaned. \"No\neducation can teach a woman logic. Now, my dear, my time is valuable. Do\nyou want me to help you or not?\"\n\n\"Not in that way.\"\n\n\"Answer my question. Plain question, plain answer. Do--\"\n\nCharles surprised them by interrupting. \"Pater, we may as well keep\nHowards End out of it,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, Charles?\"\n\nCharles could give no reason; but Margaret felt as if, over tremendous\ndistance, a salutation had passed between them.\n\n\"The whole house is at sixes and sevens,\" he said crossly. \"We don t\nwant any more mess.\"\n\n\"Who s  we ?\" asked his father. \"My boy, pray who s  we ?\"\n\n\"I am sure I beg your pardon,\" said Charles. \"I appear always to be\nintruding.\"\n\nBy now Margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her\nhusband. Retreat was impossible. He was determined to push the matter\nto a satisfactory conclusion, and Helen faded as he talked. Her fair,\nflying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing, for she was ill, without\nrights, and any of her friends might hunt her. Sick at heart, Margaret\njoined in the chase. She wrote her sister a lying letter, at her\nhusband s dictation; she said the furniture was all at Howards End, but\ncould be seen on Monday next at 3 P.M., when a charwoman would be in\nattendance. It was a cold letter, and the more plausible for that. Helen\nwould think she was offended. And on Monday next she and Henry were to\nlunch with Dolly, and then ambush themselves in the garden.\n\nAfter they had gone, Mr. Wilcox said to his son: \"I can t have this sort\nof behaviour, my boy. Margaret s too sweet-natured to mind, but I mind\nfor her.\"\n\nCharles made no answer.\n\n\"Is anything wrong with you, Charles, this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No, pater; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Don t ask me.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXV\n\nOne speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her true\nchildren have only one mood; they are all full of the rising and\ndropping of winds, and the whistling of birds. New flowers may come out,\nthe green embroidery of the hedges increase, but the same heaven broods\noverhead, soft, thick, and blue, the same figures, seen and unseen, are\nwandering by coppice and meadow. The morning that Margaret had spent\nwith Miss Avery, and the afternoon she set out to entrap Helen, were the\nscales of a single balance. Time might never have moved, rain never\nhave fallen, and man alone, with his schemes and ailments, was troubling\nNature until he saw her through a veil of tears.\n\nShe protested no more. Whether Henry was right or wrong, he was most\nkind, and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him. She\nmust trust him absolutely. As soon as he had taken up a business, his\nobtuseness vanished. He profited by the slightest indications, and the\ncapture of Helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of\nEvie.\n\nThey went down in the morning as arranged, and he discovered that their\nvictim was actually in Hilton. On his arrival he called at all\nthe livery-stables in the village, and had a few minutes  serious\nconversation with the proprietors. What he said, Margaret did not\nknow--perhaps not the truth; but news arrived after lunch that a lady\nhad come by the London train, and had taken a fly to Howards End.\n\n\"She was bound to drive,\" said Henry. \"There will be her books.\"\n\n\"I cannot make it out,\" said Margaret for the hundredth time.\n\n\"Finish your coffee, dear. We must be off.\"\n\n\"Yes, Margaret, you know you must take plenty,\" said Dolly.\n\nMargaret tried, but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes. Dolly stole\nglances at her father-in-law which he did not answer. In the silence the\nmotor came round to the door.\n\n\"You re not fit for it,\" he said anxiously. \"Let me go alone. I know\nexactly what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I am fit,\" said Margaret, uncovering her face. \"Only most\nfrightfully worried. I cannot feel that Helen is really alive. Her\nletters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else. Her voice\nisn t in them. I don t believe your driver really saw her at the\nstation. I wish I d never mentioned it. I know that Charles is vexed.\nYes, he is--\" She seized Dolly s hand and kissed it. \"There, Dolly will\nforgive me. There. Now we ll be off.\"\n\nHenry had been looking at her closely. He did not like this breakdown.\n\n\"Don t you want to tidy yourself?\" he asked.\n\n\"Have I time?\"\n\n\"Yes, plenty.\"\n\nShe went to the lavatory by the front door, and as soon as the bolt\nslipped, Mr. Wilcox said quietly:\n\n\"Dolly, I m going without her.\"\n\nDolly s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement. She followed him on tiptoe\nout to the car.\n\n\"Tell her I thought it best.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Wilcox, I see.\"\n\n\"Say anything you like. All right.\"\n\nThe car started well, and with ordinary luck would have got away. But\nPorgly-woggles, who was playing in the garden, chose this moment to sit\ndown in the middle of the path. Crane, in trying to pass him, ran one\nwheel over a bed of wallflowers. Dolly screamed. Margaret, hearing the\nnoise, rushed out hatless, and was in time to jump on the footboard.\nShe said not a single word; he was only treating her as she had treated\nHelen, and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what Helen\nwould feel against them. She thought, \"I deserve it; I am punished for\nlowering my colours.\" And she accepted his apologies with a calmness\nthat astonished him.\n\n\"I still consider you are not fit for it,\" he kept saying.\n\n\"Perhaps I was not at lunch. But the whole thing is spread clearly\nbefore me now.\"\n\n\"I was meaning to act for the best.\"\n\n\"Just lend me your scarf, will you. This wind takes one s hair so.\"\n\n\"Certainly, dear girl. Are you all right now?\"\n\n\"Look! My hands have stopped trembling.\"\n\n\"And have quite forgiven me? Then listen. Her cab should already have\narrived at Howards End. (We re a little late, but no matter.) Our first\nmove will be to send it down to wait at the farm, as, if possible, one\ndoesn t want a scene before servants. A certain gentleman\"--he pointed\nat Crane s back--\"won t drive in, but will wait a little short of the\nfront gate, behind the laurels. Have you still the keys of the house?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, they aren t wanted. Do you remember how the house stands?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If we don t find her in the porch, we can stroll round into the garden.\nOur object--\"\n\nHere they stopped to pick up the doctor.\n\n\"I was just saying to my wife, Mansbridge, that our main object is not\nto frighten Miss Schlegel. The house, as you know, is my property, so it\nshould seem quite natural for us to be there. The trouble is evidently\nnervous--wouldn t you say so, Margaret?\"\n\nThe doctor, a very young man, began to ask questions about Helen. Was\nshe normal? Was there anything congenital or hereditary? Had anything\noccurred that was likely to alienate her from her family?\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered Margaret, wondering what would have happened if she\nhad added: \"Though she did resent my husband s immorality.\"\n\n\"She always was highly strung,\" pursued Henry, leaning back in the\ncar as it shot past the church. \"A tendency to spiritualism and those\nthings, though nothing serious. Musical, literary, artistic, but I\nshould say normal--a very charming girl.\"\n\nMargaret s anger and terror increased every moment. How dare these\nmen label her sister! What horrors lay ahead! What impertinences that\nshelter under the name of science! The pack was turning on Helen, to\ndeny her human rights, and it seemed to Margaret that all Schlegels were\nthreatened with her. \"Were they normal?\" What a question to ask! And it\nis always those who know nothing about human nature, who are bored by\npsychology--and shocked by physiology, who ask it. However piteous her\nsister s state, she knew that she must be on her side. They would be mad\ntogether if the world chose to consider them so.\n\nIt was now five minutes past three. The car slowed down by the farm, in\nthe yard of which Miss Avery was standing. Henry asked her whether a cab\nhad gone past. She nodded, and the next moment they caught sight of it,\nat the end of the lane. The car ran silently like a beast of prey. So\nunsuspicious was Helen that she was sitting in the porch, with her back\nto the road. She had come. Only her head and shoulders were visible. She\nsat framed in the vine, and one of her hands played with the buds. The\nwind ruffled her hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always\nbeen.\n\nMargaret was seated next to the door. Before her husband could prevent\nher, she slipped out. She ran to the garden gate, which was shut, passed\nthrough it, and deliberately pushed it in his face. The noise alarmed\nHelen. Margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement, and, rushing\ninto the porch, learnt the simple explanation of all their fears--her\nsister was with child.\n\n\"Is the truant all right?\" called Henry.\n\nShe had time to whisper: \"Oh, my darling--\" The keys of the house were\nin her hand. She unlocked Howards End and thrust Helen into it. \"Yes,\nall right,\" she said, and stood with her back to the door.\n\n\n",

Margaret shook her head at them; she could not speak any\nmore. She remained clutching the keys, as if all their future depended\non them. Henry was asking more questions. She shook her head again. His\nwords had no sense. She heard him wonder why she had let Helen in. \"You\nmight have given me a knock with the gate,\" was another of his remarks.\nPresently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said, \"Go\naway.\" Henry came nearer. He repeated, \"Margaret, you look upset again.\nMy dear, give me the keys. What are you doing with Helen?\"\n\n\"Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage it all.\"\n\n\"Manage what?\"\n\nHe stretched out his hand for the keys. She might have obeyed if it had\nnot been for the doctor.\n\n\"Stop that at least,\" she said piteously; the doctor had turned back,\nand was questioning the driver of Helen s cab. A new feeling came over\nher; she was fighting for women against men. She did not care about\nrights, but if men came into Howards End, it should be over her body.\n\n\"Come, this is an odd beginning,\" said her husband.\n\nThe doctor came forward now, and whispered two words to Mr. Wilcox--the\nscandal was out. Sincerely horrified, Henry stood gazing at the earth.\n\n\"I cannot help it,\" said Margaret. \"Do wait. It s not my fault. Please\nall four of you go away now.\"\n\nNow the flyman was whispering to Crane.\n\n\"We are relying on you to help us, Mrs. Wilcox,\" said the young doctor.\n\"Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out?\"\n\n\"On what grounds?\" said Margaret, suddenly looking him straight in the\neyes.\n\nThinking it professional to prevaricate, he murmured something about a\nnervous breakdown.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but it is nothing of the sort. You are not qualified\nto attend my sister, Mr. Mansbridge. If we require your services, we\nwill let you know.\"\n\n\"I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish,\" he retorted.\n\n\"You could, but you have not. You are, therefore, not qualified to\nattend my sister.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Margaret!\" said Henry, never raising his eyes. \"This is a\nterrible business, an appalling business. It s doctor s orders. Open the\ndoor.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, but I will not.\"\n\n\"I don t agree.\"\n\nMargaret was silent.\n\n\"This business is as broad as it s long,\" contributed the doctor. \"We\nhad better all work together. You need us, Mrs. Wilcox, and we need\nyou.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Henry.\n\n\"I do not need you in the least,\" said Margaret.\n\nThe two men looked at each other anxiously.\n\n\"No more does my sister, who is still many weeks from her confinement.\"\n\n\"Margaret, Margaret!\"\n\n\"Well, Henry, send your doctor away. What possible use is he now?\"\n\nMr. Wilcox ran his eye over the house. He had a vague feeling that he\nmust stand firm and support the doctor. He himself might need support,\nfor there was trouble ahead.\n\n\"It all turns on affection now,\" said Margaret. \"Affection. Don t you\nsee?\" Resuming her usual methods, she wrote the word on the house with\nher finger. \"Surely you see. I like Helen very much, you not so much.\nMr. Mansbridge doesn t know her. That s all. And affection, when\nreciprocated, gives rights. Put that down in your note-book, Mr.\nMansbridge. It s a useful formula.\"\n\nHenry told her to be calm.\n\n\"You don t know what you want yourselves,\" said Margaret, folding her\narms. \"For one sensible remark I will let you in. But you cannot make\nit. You would trouble my sister for no reason. I will not permit it.\nI ll stand here all the day sooner.\"\n\n\"Mansbridge,\" said Henry in a low voice, \"perhaps not now.\"\n\nThe pack was breaking up. At a sign from his master, Crane also went\nback into the car.\n\n\"Now, Henry, you,\" she said gently. None of her bitterness had been\ndirected at him. \"Go away now, dear. I shall want your advice later, no\ndoubt. Forgive me if I have been cross. But, seriously, you must go.\"\n\nHe was too stupid to leave her. Now it was Mr. Mansbridge who called in\na low voice to him.\n\n\"I shall soon find you down at Dolly s,\" she called, as the gate at last\nclanged between them. The fly moved out of the way, the motor backed,\nturned a little, backed again, and turned in the narrow road. A string\nof farm carts came up in the middle; but she waited through all, for\nthere was no hurry. When all was over and the car had started, she\nopened the door. \"Oh, my darling!\" she said. \"My darling, forgive me.\"\n Helen was standing in the hall.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXVII\n\nMargaret bolted the door on the inside. Then she would have kissed her\nsister, but Helen, in a dignified voice, that came strangely from her,\nsaid:\n\n\"Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked. I have\nfound nearly everything that I want.\"\n\n\"I told you nothing that was true.\"\n\n\"It has been a great surprise, certainly. Has Aunt Juley been ill?\"\n\n\"Helen, you wouldn t think I d invent that?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Helen, turning away, and crying a very little.\n\"But one loses faith in everything after this.\"\n\n\"We thought it was illness, but even then--I haven t behaved worthily.\"\n\nHelen selected another book.\n\n\"I ought not to have consulted any one. What would our father have\nthought of me?\"\n\nShe did not think of questioning her sister, or of rebuking her. Both\nmight be necessary in the future, but she had first to purge a greater\ncrime than any that Helen could have committed--that want of confidence\nthat is the work of the devil.\n\n\"Yes, I am annoyed,\" replied Helen. \"My wishes should have been\nrespected. I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary,\nbut after Aunt Juley recovered, it was not necessary. Planning my life,\nas I now have to do.\"\n\n\"Come away from those books,\" called Margaret. \"Helen, do talk to me.\"\n\n\"I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard. One can t go\nthrough a great deal of --\"--she left out the noun--\"without planning one s\nactions in advance. I am going to have a child in June, and in the first\nplace conversations, discussions, excitement, are not good for me. I\nwill go through them if necessary, but only then. In the second place I\nhave no right to trouble people. I cannot fit in with England as I know\nit. I have done something that the English never pardon. It would not be\nright for them to pardon it. So I must live where I am not known.\"\n\n\"But why didn t you tell me, dearest?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Helen judicially. \"I might have, but decided to wait.\"\n\n\"I believe you would never have told me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I should. We have taken a flat in Munich.\"\n\nMargaret glanced out of the window.\n\n\"By  we  I mean myself and Monica. But for her, I am and have been and\nalways wish to be alone.\"\n\n\"I have not heard of Monica.\"\n\n\"You wouldn t have. She s an Italian--by birth at least. She makes her\nliving by journalism. I met her originally on Garda. Monica is much the\nbest person to see me through.\"\n\n\"You are very fond of her, then.\"\n\n\"She has been extraordinarily sensible with me.\"\n\nMargaret guessed at Monica s type--\"Italiano Inglesiato\" they had named\nit--the crude feminist of the South, whom one respects but avoids. And\nHelen had turned to it in her need!\n\n\"You must not think that we shall never meet,\" said Helen, with a\nmeasured kindness. \"I shall always have a room for you when you can be\nspared, and the longer you can be with me the better. But you haven t\nunderstood yet, Meg, and of course it is very difficult for you. This is\na shock to you. It isn t to me, who have been thinking over our futures\nfor many months, and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps, such\nas this. I cannot live in England.\"\n\n\"Helen, you ve not forgiven me for my treachery. You COULDN T talk like\nthis to me if you had.\"\n\n\"Oh, Meg dear, why do we talk at all?\" She dropped a book and sighed\nwearily. Then, recovering herself, she said: \"Tell me, how is it that\nall the books are down here?\"\n\n\"Series of mistakes.\"\n\n\"And a great deal of furniture has been unpacked.\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Who lives here, then?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are letting it, though.\"\n\n\"The house is dead,\" said Margaret, with a frown. \"Why worry on about\nit?\"\n\n\"But I am interested. You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life.\nI am still Helen, I hope. Now this hasn t the feel of a dead house.\nThe hall seems more alive even than in the old days, when it held the\nWilcoxes  own things.\"\n\n\"Interested, are you? Very well, I must tell you, I suppose. My husband\nlent it on condition we--but by a mistake all our things were unpacked,\nand Miss Avery, instead of--\" She stopped. \"Look here, I can t go on\nlike this. I warn you I won t. Helen, why should you be so miserably\nunkind to me, simply because you hate Henry?\"\n\n\"I don t hate him now,\" said Helen. \"I have stopped being a schoolgirl,\nand, Meg, once again, I m not being unkind. But as for fitting in with\nyour English life--no, put it out of your head at once. Imagine a visit\nfrom me at Ducie Street! It s unthinkable.\"\n\nMargaret could not contradict her. It was appalling to see her quietly\nmoving forward with her plans, not bitter or excitable, neither\nasserting innocence nor confessing guilt, merely desiring freedom and\nthe company of those who would not blame her. She had been through--how\nmuch? Margaret did not know. But it was enough to part her from old\nhabits as well as old friends.\n\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" said Helen, who had chosen her books, and was\nlingering over the furniture.\n\n\"There s nothing to tell.\"\n\n\"But your marriage has been happy, Meg?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don t feel inclined to talk.\"\n\n\"You feel as I do.\"\n\n\"Not that, but I can t.\"\n\n\"No more can I. It is a nuisance, but no good trying.\"\n\nSomething had come between them. Perhaps it was Society, which\nhenceforward would exclude Helen. Perhaps it was a third life, already\npotent as a spirit. They could find no meeting-place. Both suffered\nacutely, and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection\nsurvived.\n\n\"Look here, Meg, is the coast clear?\"\n\n\"You mean that you want to go away from me?\"\n\n\"I suppose so--dear old lady! it isn t any use. I knew we should have\nnothing to say. Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby, and take more\nyourself than I can say. Promise to come and see me in Munich later.\"\n\n\"Certainly, dearest.\"\n\n\"For that is all we can do.\"\n\nIt seemed so. Most ghastly of all was Helen s common sense; Monica had\nbeen extraordinarily good for her.\n\n\"I am glad to have seen you and the things.\" She looked at the bookcase\nlovingly, as if she was saying farewell to the past.\n\nMargaret unbolted the door. She remarked: \"The car has gone, and here s\nyour cab.\"\n\nShe led the way to it, glancing at the leaves and the sky. The spring\nhad never seemed more beautiful. The driver, who was leaning on the\ngate, called out, \"Please, lady, a message,\" and handed her Henry s\nvisiting-card through the bars.\n\n\"How did this come?\" she asked.\n\nCrane had returned with it almost at once.\n\nShe read the card with annoyance. It was covered with instructions in\ndomestic French. When she and her sister had talked she was to come back\nfor the night to Dolly s. \"Il faut dormir sur ce sujet.\" while Helen\nwas to be found une comfortable chambre a l hotel. The final sentence\ndispleased her greatly until she remembered that the Charles s had only\none spare room, and so could not invite a third guest.\n\n\"Henry would have done what he could,\" she interpreted.\n\nHelen had not followed her into the garden. The door once open, she lost\nher inclination to fly. She remained in the hall, going from bookcase to\ntable. She grew more like the old Helen, irresponsible and charming.\n\n\"This IS Mr. Wilcox s house?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Surely you remember Howards End?\"\n\n\"Remember? I who remember everything! But it looks to be ours now.\"\n\n\"Miss Avery was extraordinary,\" said Margaret, her own spirits\nlightening a little. Again she was invaded by a slight feeling of\ndisloyalty. But it brought her relief, and she yielded to it. \"She loved\nMrs. Wilcox, and would rather furnish her home with our things than\nthink of it empty. In consequence here are all the library books.\"\n\n\"Not all the books. She hasn t unpacked the Art books, in which she may\nshow her sense. And we never used to have the sword here.\"\n\n\"The sword looks well, though.\"\n\n\"Magnificent.\"\n\n\"Yes, doesn t it?\"\n\n\"Where s the piano, Meg?\"\n\n\"I warehoused that in London. Why?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Curious, too, that the carpet fits.\"\n\n\"The carpet s a mistake,\" announced Helen. \"I know that we had it in\nLondon, but this floor ought to be bare. It is far too beautiful.\"\n\n\"You still have a mania for under-furnishing. Would you care to come\ninto the dining-room before you start? There s no carpet there.\"\n\nThey went in, and each minute their talk became more natural.\n\n\"Oh, WHAT a place for mother s chiffonier!\" cried Helen.\n\n\"Look at the chairs, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, look at them! Wickham Place faced north, didn t it?\"\n\n\"North-west.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun.\nFeel. Their dear little backs are quite warm.\"\n\n\"But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners? I shall just--\"\n\n\"Over here, Meg. Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn.\"\n\nMargaret moved a chair. Helen sat down in it.\n\n\"Ye--es. The window s too high.\"\n\n\"Try a drawing-room chair.\"\n\n\"No, I don t like the drawing-room so much. The beam has been\nmatch-boarded. It would have been so beautiful otherwise.\"\n\n\"Helen, what a memory you have for some things! You re perfectly right.\nIt s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for\nwomen. Men don t know what we want--\"\n\n\"And never will.\"\n\n\"I don t agree. In two thousand years they ll know. Look where Tibby\nspilt the soup.\"\n\n\"Coffee. It was coffee surely.\"\n\nHelen shook her head. \"Impossible. Tibby was far too young to be given\ncoffee at that time.\"\n\n\"Was father alive?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you re right and it must have been soup. I was thinking of much\nlater--that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley s, when she didn t realise\nthat Tibby had grown up. It was coffee then, for he threw it down on\npurpose. There was some rhyme,  Tea, coffee--coffee tea,  that she said\nto him every morning at breakfast. Wait a minute--how did it go?\"\n\n\"I know--no, I don t. What a detestable boy Tibby was!\"\n\n\"But the rhyme was simply awful. No decent person could put up with it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that greengage-tree,\" cried Helen, as if the garden was also part\nof their childhood. \"Why do I connect it with dumb-bells? And there come\nthe chickens. The grass wants cutting. I love yellow-hammers.\"\n\nMargaret interrupted her. \"I have got it,\" she announced.\n\n       \" Tea, tea, coffee, tea,\n         Or chocolaritee.'\"\n\n\"That every morning for three weeks. No wonder Tibby was wild.\"\n\n\"Tibby is moderately a dear now,\" said Helen.\n\n\"There! I knew you d say that in the end. Of course he s a dear.\"\n\nA bell rang.\n\n\"Listen! what s that?\"\n\nHelen said, \"Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege.\"\n\n\"What nonsense--listen!\"\n\nAnd the triviality faded from their faces, though it left something\nbehind--the knowledge that they never could be parted because their love\nwas rooted in common things. Explanations and appeals had failed; they\nhad tried for a common meeting-ground, and had only made each other\nunhappy. And all the time their salvation was lying round them--the past\nsanctifying the present; the present, with wild heart-throb, declaring\nthat there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of\nchildren. Helen, still smiling, came up to her sister. She said, \"It\nis always Meg.\" They looked into each other s eyes. The inner life had\npaid.\n\nSolemnly the clapper tolled. No one was in the front. Margaret went to\nthe kitchen, and struggled between packing-cases to the window. Their\nvisitor was only a little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned.\n\n\"Little boy, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Please, I am the milk.\"\n\n\"Did Miss Avery send you?\" said Margaret, rather sharply.\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\n\"Then take it back and say we require no milk.\" While she called to\nHelen, \"No, it s not the siege, but possibly an attempt to provision us\nagainst one.\"\n\n\"But I like milk,\" cried Helen. \"Why send it away?\"\n\n\"Do you? Oh, very well. But we ve nothing to put it in, and he wants the\ncan.\"\n\n\"Please, I m to call in the morning for the can,\" said the boy.\n\n\"The house will be locked up then.\"\n\n\"In the morning would I bring eggs too?\"\n\n\"Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?\"\n\nThe child hung his head.\n\n\"Well, run away and do it again.\"\n\n\"Nice little boy,\" whispered Helen. \"I say, what s your name? Mine s\nHelen.\"\n\n\"Tom.\"\n\nThat was Helen all over. The Wilcoxes, too, would ask a child its name,\nbut they never told their names in return.\n\n\"Tom, this one here is Margaret. And at home we ve another called Tibby.\"\n\n\"Mine are lop-eareds,\" replied Tom, supposing Tibby to be a rabbit.\n\n\"You re a very good and rather a clever little boy. Mind you come\nagain.--Isn t he charming?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Margaret. \"He is probably the son of Madge, and\nMadge is dreadful. But this place has wonderful powers.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don t know.\"\n\n\"Because I probably agree with you.\"\n\n\"It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live.\"\n\n\"I do agree,\" said Helen, as she sipped the milk. \"But you said that the\nhouse was dead not half an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Meaning that I was dead. I felt it.\"\n\n\"Yes, the house has a surer life than we, even if it was empty, and, as\nit is, I can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone\nfull on our furniture. After all, Wickham Place was a grave. Meg, I ve a\nstartling idea.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Drink some milk to steady you.\"\n\nMargaret obeyed.\n\n\"No, I won t tell you yet,\" said Helen, \"because you may laugh or be\nangry. Let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing.\"\n\nThey opened window after window, till the inside, too, was rustling\nto the spring. Curtains blew, picture frames tapped cheerfully. Helen\nuttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right\nplace, that in its wrong one. She was angry with Miss Avery for not\nhaving moved the wardrobes up. \"Then one would see really.\" She admired\nthe view. She was the Helen who had written the memorable letters four\nyears ago. As they leant out, looking westward, she said: \"About my\nidea. Couldn t you and I camp out in this house for the night?\"\n\n\"I don t think we could well do that,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"Here are beds, tables, towels--\"\n\n\"I know; but the house isn t supposed to be slept in, and Henry s\nsuggestion was--\"\n\n\"I require no suggestions. I shall not alter anything in my plans. But\nit would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you. It\nwill be something to look back on. Oh, Meg lovey, do let s!\"\n\n\"But, Helen, my pet,\" said Margaret, \"we can t without getting Henry s\nleave. Of course, he would give it, but you said yourself that you\ncouldn t visit at Ducie Street now, and this is equally intimate.\"\n\n\"Ducie Street is his house. This is ours. Our furniture, our sort of\npeople coming to the door. Do let us camp out, just one night, and Tom\nshall feed us on eggs and milk. Why not? It s a moon.\"\n\nMargaret hesitated. \"I feel Charles wouldn t like it,\" she said at last.\n\"Even our furniture annoyed him, and I was going to clear it out when\nAunt Juley s illness prevented me. I sympathise with Charles. He feels\nit s his mother s house. He loves it in rather an untaking way. Henry I\ncould answer for--not Charles.\"\n\n\"I know he won t like it,\" said Helen. \"But I am going to pass out of\ntheir lives. What difference will it make in the long run if they say,\n And she even spent the night at Howards End ?\"\n\n\"How do you know you ll pass out of their lives? We have thought that\ntwice before.\"\n\n\"Because my plans--\"\n\n\"--which you change in a moment.\"\n\n\"Then because my life is great and theirs are little,\" said Helen,\ntaking fire. \"I know of things they can t know of, and so do you. We\nknow that there s poetry. We know that there s death. They can only take\nthem on hearsay. We know this is our house, because it feels ours. Oh,\nthey may take the title-deeds and the door-keys, but for this one night\nwe are at home.\"\n\n\"It would be lovely to have you once more alone,\" said Margaret. \"It may\nbe a chance in a thousand.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we could talk.\" She dropped her voice. \"It won t be a\nvery glorious story. But under that wych-elm--honestly, I see little\nhappiness ahead. Cannot I have this one night with you?\"\n\n\"I needn t say how much it would mean to me.\"\n\n\"Then let us.\"\n\n\"It is no good hesitating. Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get\nleave?\"\n\n\"Oh, we don t want leave.\"\n\nBut Margaret was a loyal wife. In spite of imagination and\npoetry--perhaps on account of them--she could sympathise with the\ntechnical attitude that Henry would adopt. If possible, she would be\ntechnical, too. A night s lodging--and they demanded no more--need not\ninvolve the discussion of general principles.\n\n\"Charles may say no,\" grumbled Helen.\n\n\"We shan t consult him.\"\n\n\"Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave.\"\n\nIt was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to mar Helen s\ncharacter, and even added to its beauty. She would have stopped without\nleave and escaped to Germany the next morning. Margaret kissed her.\n\n\"Expect me back before dark. I am looking forward to it so much. It is\nlike you to have thought of such a beautiful thing.\"\n\n\"Not a thing, only an ending,\" said Helen rather sadly; and the sense of\ntragedy closed in on Margaret again as soon as she left the house.\n\nShe was afraid of Miss Avery. It is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy,\nhowever superficially. She was glad to see no watching figure as she\ndrove past the farm, but only little Tom, turning somersaults in the\nstraw.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXVIII\n\nThe tragedy began quietly enough, and, like many another talk, by the\nman s deft assertion of his superiority. Henry heard her arguing with\nthe driver, stepped out and settled the fellow, who was inclined to be\nrude, and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn. Dolly, who\nhad not been \"told,\" ran out with offers of tea. He refused them, and\nordered them to wheel baby s perambulator away, as they desired to be\nalone.\n\n\"But the diddums can t listen; he isn t nine months old,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"That s not what I was saying,\" retorted her father-in-law.\n\nBaby was wheeled out of earshot, and did not hear about the crisis till\nlater years. It was now the turn of Margaret.\n\n\"Is it what we feared?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Dear girl,\" he began, \"there is a troublesome business ahead of us,\nand nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see\nus through.\" Margaret bent her head. \"I am obliged to question you on\nsubjects we d both prefer to leave untouched. As you know, I am not one\nof your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred. To speak as I must\nwill pain me, but there are occasions--We are husband and wife, not\nchildren. I am a man of the world, and you are a most exceptional\nwoman.\"\n\nAll Margaret s senses forsook her. She blushed, and looked past him at\nthe Six Hills, covered with spring herbage. Noting her colour, he grew\nstill more kind.\n\n\"I see that you feel as I felt when--My poor little wife! Oh, be brave!\nJust one or two questions, and I have done with you. Was your sister\nwearing a wedding-ring?\"\n\nMargaret stammered a \"No.\"\n\nThere was an appalling silence.\n\n\"Henry, I really came to ask a favour about Howards End.\"\n\n\"One point at a time. I am now obliged to ask for the name of her\nseducer.\"\n\nShe rose to her feet and held the chair between them. Her colour had\nebbed, and she was grey. It did not displease him that she should\nreceive his question thus.\n\n\"Take your time,\" he counselled her. \"Remember that this is far worse\nfor me than for you.\"\n\nShe swayed; he feared she was going to faint. Then speech came, and she\nsaid slowly: \"Seducer? No; I do not know her seducer s name.\"\n\n\"Would she not tell you?\"\n\n\"I never even asked her who seduced her,\" said Margaret, dwelling on the\nhateful word thoughtfully.\n\n\"That is singular.\" Then he changed his mind. \"Natural perhaps, dear\ngirl, that you shouldn t ask. But until his name is known, nothing can\nbe done. Sit down. How terrible it is to see you so upset! I knew you\nweren t fit for it. I wish I hadn t taken you.\"\n\nMargaret answered, \"I like to stand, if you don t mind, for it gives me\na pleasant view of the Six Hills.\"\n\n\"As you like.\"\n\n\"Have you anything else to ask me, Henry?\"\n\n\"Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything. I have often\nnoticed your insight, dear. I only wish my own was as good. You may have\nguessed something, even though your sister said nothing. The slightest\nhint would help us.\"\n\n\"Who is  we ?\"\n\n\"I thought it best to ring up Charles.\"\n\n\"That was unnecessary,\" said Margaret, growing warmer. \"This news will\ngive Charles disproportionate pain.\"\n\n\"He has at once gone to call on your brother.\"\n\n\"That too was unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don t think that I and\nmy son are other than gentlemen? It is in Helen s interests that we are\nacting. It is still not too late to save her name.\"\n\nThen Margaret hit out for the first time. \"Are we to make her seducer\nmarry her?\" she asked.\n\n\"If possible, yes.\"\n\n\"But, Henry, suppose he turned out to be married already? One has heard\nof such cases.\"\n\n\"In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct, and be thrashed\nwithin an inch of his life.\"\n\nSo her first blow missed. She was thankful of it. What had tempted her\nto imperil both of their lives. Henry s obtuseness had saved her as well\nas himself. Exhausted with anger, she sat down again, blinking at him as\nhe told her as much as he thought fit. At last she said: \"May I ask you\nmy question now?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear.\"\n\n\"To-morrow Helen goes to Munich--\"\n\n\"Well, possibly she is right.\"\n\n\"Henry, let a lady finish. To-morrow she goes; to-night, with your\npermission, she would like to sleep at Howards End.\"\n\nIt was the crisis of his life. Again she would have recalled the words\nas soon as they were uttered. She had not led up to them with sufficient\ncare. She longed to warn him that they were far more important than\nhe supposed. She saw him weighing them, as if they were a business\nproposition.\n\n\"Why Howards End?\" he said at last. \"Would she not be more comfortable,\nas I suggested, at the hotel?\"\n\nMargaret hastened to give him reasons. \"It is an odd request, but you\nknow what Helen is and what women in her state are.\" He frowned, and\nmoved irritably. \"She has the idea that one night in your house would\ngive her pleasure and do her good. I think she s right. Being one of\nthose imaginative girls, the presence of all our books and furniture\nsoothes her. This is a fact. It is the end of her girlhood. Her last\nwords to me were,  A beautiful ending. \"\n\n\"She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons, in fact.\"\n\n\"Exactly. You have quite understood. It is her last hope of being with\nit.\"\n\n\"I don t agree there, my dear! Helen will have her share of the goods\nwherever she goes--possibly more than her share, for you are so fond\nof her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn t\nyou? and I d raise no objection. I could understand it if it was her old\nhome, because a home, or a house,\" he changed the word, designedly; he\nhad thought of a telling point--\"because a house in which one has once\nlived becomes in a sort of way sacred, I don t know why. Associations\nand so on. Now Helen has no associations with Howards End, though I\nand Charles and Evie have. I do not see why she wants to stay the night\nthere. She will only catch cold.\"\n\n\"Leave it that you don t see,\" cried Margaret. \"Call it fancy. But\nrealise that fancy is a scientific fact. Helen is fanciful, and wants\nto.\"\n\nThen he surprised her--a rare occurrence. He shot an unexpected bolt.\n\"If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two. We shall\nnever get her out of the house, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Margaret, with the precipice in sight. \"And suppose we\ndon t get her out of the house? Would it matter? She would do no one any\nharm.\"\n\nAgain the irritated gesture.\n\n\"No, Henry,\" she panted, receding. \"I didn t mean that. We will\nonly trouble Howards End for this one night. I take her to London\nto-morrow--\"\n\n\"Do you intend to sleep in a damp house, too?\"\n\n\"She cannot be left alone.\"\n\n\"That s quite impossible! Madness. You must be here to meet Charles.\"\n\n\"I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary,\nand I have no desire to meet him.\"\n\n\"Margaret--my Margaret.\"\n\n\"What has this business to do with Charles? If it concerns me little, it\nconcerns you less, and Charles not at all.\"\n\n\"As the future owner of Howards End,\" said Mr. Wilcox arching his\nfingers, \"I should say that it did concern Charles.\"\n\n\"In what way? Will Helen s condition depreciate the property?\"\n\n\"My dear, you are forgetting yourself.\"\n\n\"I think you yourself recommended plain speaking.\"\n\nThey looked at each other in amazement. The precipice was at their feet\nnow.\n\n\"Helen commands my sympathy,\" said Henry. \"As your husband, I shall do\nall for her that I can, and I have no doubt that she will prove more\nsinned against than sinning. But I cannot treat her as if nothing has\nhappened. I should be false to my position in society if I did.\"\n\nShe controlled herself for the last time. \"No, let us go back to Helen s\nrequest,\" she said. \"It is unreasonable, but the request of an unhappy\ngirl. Tomorrow she will go to Germany, and trouble society no longer.\nTo-night she asks to sleep in your empty house--a house which you do not\ncare about, and which you have not occupied for over a year. May she?\nWill you give my sister leave? Will you forgive her as you hope to be\nforgiven, and as you have actually been forgiven? Forgive her for one\nnight only. That will be enough.\"\n\n\"As I have actually been forgiven--?\"\n\n\"Never mind for the moment what I mean by that,\" said Margaret. \"Answer\nmy question.\"\n\nPerhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him. If so, he blotted\nit out. Straight from his fortress he answered: \"I seem rather\nunaccommodating, but I have some experience of life, and know how one\nthing leads to another. I am afraid that your sister had better sleep\nat the hotel. I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to\nconsider. I am sorry, but see that she leaves my house at once.\"\n\n\"You have mentioned Mrs. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"A rare occurrence. In reply, may I mention Mrs. Bast?\"\n\n\"You have not been yourself all day,\" said Henry, and rose from his seat\nwith face unmoved. Margaret rushed at him and seized both his hands. She\nwas transfigured.\n\n\"Not any more of this!\" she cried. \"You shall see the connection if it\nkills you, Henry! You have had a mistress--I forgave you. My sister\nhas a lover--you drive her from the house. Do you see the connection?\nStupid, hypocritical, cruel--oh, contemptible!--a man who insults his\nwife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead. A man\nwho ruins a woman for his pleasure, and casts her off to ruin other men.\nAnd gives bad financial advice, and then says he is not responsible.\nThese men are you. You can t recognise them, because you cannot connect.\nI ve had enough of your unneeded kindness. I ve spoilt you long enough.\nAll your life you have been spoiled. Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you. No one has\never told what you are--muddled, criminally muddled. Men like you use\nrepentance as a blind, so don t repent. Only say to yourself,  What\nHelen has done, I ve done. \"\n\n\"The two cases are different,\" Henry stammered. His real retort was\nnot quite ready. His brain was still in a whirl, and he wanted a little\nlonger.\n\n\"In what way different? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox, Helen only\nherself. You remain in society, Helen can t. You have had only pleasure,\nshe may die. You have the insolence to talk to me of differences,\nHenry?\"\n\nOh, the uselessness of it! Henry s retort came.\n\n\"I perceive you are attempting blackmail. It is scarcely a pretty weapon\nfor a wife to use against her husband. My rule through life has been\nnever to pay the least attention to threats, and I can only repeat\nwhat I said before: I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at\nHowards End.\"\n\nMargaret loosed his hands. He went into the house, wiping first one and\nthen the other on his handkerchief. For a little she stood looking at\nthe Six Hills, tombs of warriors, breasts of the spring. Then she passed\nout into what was now the evening.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XXXIX\n\nCharles and Tibby met at Ducie Street, where the latter was staying.\nTheir interview was short and absurd. They had nothing in common but the\nEnglish language, and tried by its help to express what neither of them\nunderstood. Charles saw in Helen the family foe. He had singled her out\nas the most dangerous of the Schlegels, and, angry as he was, looked\nforward to telling his wife how right he had been. His mind was made up\nat once; the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them\nfarther. If occasion offered she might be married to a villain, or,\npossibly, to a fool. But this was a concession to morality, it formed\nno part of his main scheme. Honest and hearty was Charles s dislike, and\nthe past spread itself out very clearly before him; hatred is a skilful\ncompositor. As if they were heads in a note-book, he ran through all\nthe incidents of the Schlegels  campaign: the attempt to compromise his\nbrother, his mother s legacy, his father s marriage, the introduction\nof the furniture, the unpacking of the same. He had not yet heard of the\nrequest to sleep at Howards End; that was to be their master-stroke and\nthe opportunity for his. But he already felt that Howards End was the\nobjective, and, though he disliked the house, was determined to defend\nit.\n\nTibby, on the other hand, had no opinions. He stood above the\nconventions: his sister had a right to do what she thought right. It is\nnot difficult to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages\namong them; men can always be more unconventional than women, and a\nbachelor of independent means need encounter no difficulties at all.\nUnlike Charles, Tibby had money enough; his ancestors had earned it for\nhim, and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to\nmove into another. His was the leisure without sympathy--an attitude as\nfatal as the strenuous; a little cold culture may be raised on it, but\nno art. His sisters had seen the family danger, and had never forgotten\nto discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea. Tibby gave\nall the praise to himself, and so despised the struggling and the\nsubmerged.\n\nHence the absurdity of the interview; the gulf between them was economic\nas well as spiritual. But several facts passed; Charles pressed for them\nwith an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand. On what\ndate had Helen gone abroad? To whom? (Charles was anxious to fasten the\nscandal on Germany.) Then, changing his tactics, he said roughly: \"I\nsuppose you realise that you are your sister s protector?\"\n\n\"In what sense?\"\n\n\"If a man played about with my sister, I d send a bullet through him,\nbut perhaps you don t mind.\"\n\n\"I mind very much,\" protested Tibby.\n\n\"Who d ye suspect, then? Speak out man. One always suspects some one.\"\n\n\"No one. I don t think so.\" Involuntarily he blushed. He had remembered\nthe scene in his Oxford rooms.\n\n\"You are hiding something,\" said Charles. As interviews go, he got the\nbest of this one. \"When you saw her last, did she mention any one s\nname? Yes or no!\" he thundered, so that Tibby started.\n\n\"In my rooms she mentioned some friends, called the Basts.\"\n\n\"Who are the Basts?\"\n\n\"People--friends of hers at Evie s wedding.\"\n\n\"I don t remember. But, by great Scott, I do! My aunt told me about some\nrag-tag. Was she full of them when you saw her? Is there a man? Did she\nspeak of the man? Or--look here--have you had any dealings with him?\"\n\nTibby was silent. Without intending it, he had betrayed his sister s\nconfidence; he was not enough interested in human life to see where\nthings will lead to. He had a strong regard for honesty, and his word,\nonce given, had always been kept up to now. He was deeply vexed, not\nonly for the harm he had done Helen, but for the flaw he had discovered\nin his own equipment.\n\n\"I see--you are in his confidence. They met at your rooms. Oh, what a\nfamily, what a family! God help the poor pater--\"\n\nAnd Tibby found himself alone.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XL\n\nLeonard--he would figure at length in a newspaper report, but that\nevening he did not count for much. The foot of the tree was in shadow,\nsince the moon was still hidden behind the house. But above, to right,\nto left, down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming. Leonard\nseemed not a man, but a cause.\n\nPerhaps it was Helen s way of falling in love--a curious way to\nMargaret, whose agony and whose contempt of Henry were yet imprinted\nwith his image. Helen forgot people. They were husks that had enclosed\nher emotion. She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts,\nbut had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having\nlost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?\n\nMargaret wondered, but said no word of blame. This was Helen s evening.\nTroubles enough lay ahead of her--the loss of friends and of social\nadvantages, the agony, the supreme agony, of motherhood, which is not\neven yet a matter of common knowledge. For the present let the moon\nshine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying away\nfrom the gale of the day, and let the earth, that brings increase, bring\npeace. Not even to herself dare she blame Helen.\n\nShe could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything\nor nothing. Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and\ngroup most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen.\nThe surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that\nmorality is not speaking. Christ was evasive when they questioned Him.\nIt is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.\n\nThis was Helen s evening--won at what cost, and not to be marred by the\nsorrows of others. Of her own tragedy Margaret never uttered a word.\n\n\"One isolates,\" said Helen slowly. \"I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other\nforces that were pulling Leonard downhill. Consequently, I was full of\npity, and almost of revenge. For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only, and\nso, when your letters came--\"\n\n\"I need never have written them,\" sighed Margaret. \"They never shielded\nHenry. How hopeless it is to tidy away the past, even for others!\"\n\n\"I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts.\"\n\n\"Looking back, that was wrong of me.\"\n\n\"Looking back, darling, I know that it was right. It is right to save\nthe man whom one loves. I am less enthusiastic about justice now. But we\nboth thought you wrote at his dictation. It seemed the last touch of his\ncallousness. Being very much wrought up by this time--and Mrs. Bast\nwas upstairs. I had not seen her, and had talked for a long time to\nLeonard--I had snubbed him for no reason, and that should have warned me\nI was in danger. So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an\nexplanation. He said that he guessed the explanation--he knew of it, and\nyou mustn t know. I pressed him to tell me. He said no one must know; it\nwas something to do with his wife. Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast\nand Miss Schlegel. I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me\nwhen I saw his eyes, and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two\nways, not one. I drew him to me. I made him tell me. I felt very lonely\nmyself. He is not to blame. He would have gone on worshipping me. I want\nnever to see him again, though it sounds appalling. I wanted to give him\nmoney and feel finished. Oh, Meg, the little that is known about these\nthings!\"\n\nShe laid her face against the tree.\n\n\"The little, too, that is known about growth! Both times it was\nloneliness, and the night, and panic afterwards. Did Leonard grow out of\nPaul?\"\n\nMargaret did not speak for a moment. So tired was she that her attention\nhad actually wandered to the teeth--the teeth that had been thrust into\nthe tree s bark to medicate it. From where she sat she could see them\ngleam. She had been trying to count them. \"Leonard is a better growth\nthan madness,\" she said. \"I was afraid that you would react against Paul\nuntil you went over the verge.\"\n\n\"I did react until I found poor Leonard. I am steady now. I shan t ever\nlike your Henry, dearest Meg, or even speak kindly about him, but all\nthat blinding hate is over. I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any\nmore. I understand how you married him, and you will now be very happy.\"\n\nMargaret did not reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Helen, her voice growing more tender, \"I do at last\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Except Mrs. Wilcox, dearest, no one understands our little movements.\"\n\n\"Because in death--I agree.\"\n\n\"Not quite. I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that\nwoman s mind. She knows everything. She is everything. She is the house,\nand the tree that leans over it. People have their own deaths as well\nas their own lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall\ndiffer in our nothingness. I cannot believe that knowledge such as hers\nwill perish with knowledge such as mine. She knew about realities. She\nknew when people were in love, though she was not in the room. I don t\ndoubt that she knew when Henry deceived her.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mrs. Wilcox,\" called a voice.\n\n\"Oh, good-night, Miss Avery.\"\n\n\"Why should Miss Avery work for us?\" Helen murmured.\n\n\"Why, indeed?\"\n\nMiss Avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided\nit from the farm. An old gap, which Mr. Wilcox had filled up, had\nreappeared, and her track through the dew followed the path that he had\nturfed over, when he improved the garden and made it possible for games.\n\n\"This is not quite our house yet,\" said Helen. \"When Miss Avery called,\nI felt we are only a couple of tourists.\"\n\n\"We shall be that everywhere, and for ever.\"\n\n\"But affectionate tourists.\"\n\n\"But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home.\"\n\n\"I can t pretend very long,\" said Helen. \"Sitting under this tree one\nforgets, but I know that to-morrow I shall see the moon rise out of\nGermany. Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case. Unless\nyou will come with me.\"\n\nMargaret thought for a moment. In the past year she had grown so fond\nof England that to leave it was a real grief. Yet what detained her? No\ndoubt Henry would pardon her outburst, and go on blustering and muddling\ninto a ripe old age. But what was the good? She had just as soon vanish\nfrom his mind.\n\n\"Are you serious in asking me, Helen? Should I get on with your Monica?\"\n\n\"You would not, but I am serious in asking you.\"\n\n\"Still, no more plans now. And no more reminiscences.\"\n\nThey were silent for a little. It was Helen s evening.\n\nThe present flowed by them like a stream. The tree rustled. It had made\nmusic before they were born, and would continue after their deaths,\nbut its song was of the moment. The moment had passed. The tree rustled\nagain. Their senses were sharpened, and they seemed to apprehend life.\nLife passed. The tree rustled again.\n\n\"Sleep now,\" said Margaret.\n\nThe peace of the country was entering into her. It has no commerce with\nmemory, and little with hope. Least of all is it concerned with the\nhopes of the next five minutes. It is the peace of the present, which\npasses understanding. Its murmur came \"now,\" and \"now\" once more as they\ntrod the gravel, and \"now,\" as the moonlight fell upon their father s\nsword. They passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless iterations\nfell asleep. The house had enshadowed the tree at first, but as the moon\nrose higher the two disentangled, and were clear for a few moments\nat midnight. Margaret awoke and looked into the garden. How\nincomprehensible that Leonard Bast should have won her this night of\npeace! Was he also part of Mrs. Wilcox s mind?\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XLI\n\nFar different was Leonard s development. The months after Oniton,\nwhatever minor troubles they might bring him, were all overshadowed by\nRemorse. When Helen looked back she could philosophise, or she could\nlook into the future and plan for her child. But the father saw nothing\nbeyond his own sin. Weeks afterwards, in the midst of other occupations,\nhe would suddenly cry out, \"Brute--you brute, I couldn t have--\" and be\nrent into two people who held dialogues. Or brown rain would descend,\nblotting out faces and the sky. Even Jacky noticed the change in him.\nMost terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep. Sometimes\nhe was happy at first, but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him\nand weighing down his thoughts when they would move. Or little irons\nscorched his body. Or a sword stabbed him. He would sit at the edge of\nhis bed, holding his heart and moaning, \"Oh what SHALL I do, whatever\nSHALL I do?\" Nothing brought ease. He could put distance between him and\nthe trespass, but it grew in his soul.\n\nRemorse is not among the eternal verities. The Greeks were right to\ndethrone her. Her action is too capricious, as though the Erinyes\nselected for punishment only certain men and certain sins. And of all\nmeans to regeneration Remorse is surely the most wasteful. It cuts away\nhealthy tissues with the poisoned. It is a knife that probes far deeper\nthan the evil. Leonard was driven straight through its torments and\nemerged pure, but enfeebled--a better man, who would never lose control\nof himself again, but also a smaller man, who had less to control. Nor\ndid purity mean peace. The use of the knife can become a habit as hard\nto shake off as passion itself, and Leonard continued to start with a\ncry out of dreams.\n\nHe built up a situation that was far enough from the truth. It never\noccurred to him that Helen was to blame. He forgot the intensity of\ntheir talk, the charm that had been lent him by sincerity, the magic\nof Oniton under darkness and of the whispering river. Helen loved the\nabsolute. Leonard had been ruined absolutely, and had appeared to her\nas a man apart, isolated from the world. A real man, who cared for\nadventure and beauty, who desired to live decently and pay his way, who\ncould have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut\ncar that was crushing him. Memories of Evie s wedding had warped\nher, the starched servants, the yards of uneaten food, the rustle of\noverdressed women, motor-cars oozing grease on the gravel, a pretentious\nband. She had tasted the lees of this on her arrival; in the darkness,\nafter failure, they intoxicated her. She and the victim seemed alone in\na world of unreality, and she loved him absolutely, perhaps for half an\nhour.\n\nIn the morning she was gone. The note that she left, tender and\nhysterical in tone, and intended to be most kind, hurt her lover\nterribly. It was as if some work of art had been broken by him, some\npicture in the National Gallery slashed out of its frame. When he\nrecalled her talents and her social position, he felt that the first\npasser-by had a right to shoot him down. He was afraid of the waitress\nand the porters at the railway-station. He was afraid at first of his\nwife, though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness,\nand to think, \"There is nothing to choose between us, after all.\"\n\nThe expedition to Shropshire crippled the Basts permanently. Helen\nin her flight forgot to settle the hotel bill, and took their return\ntickets away with her; they had to pawn Jacky s bangles to get home, and\nthe smash came a few days afterwards. It is true that Helen offered him\nfive thousand pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him. He could not\nsee that the girl was desperately righting herself, and trying to save\nsomething out of the disaster, if it was only five thousand pounds. But\nhe had to live somehow. He turned to his family, and degraded himself to\na professional beggar. There was nothing else for him to do.\n\n\"A letter from Leonard,\" thought Blanche, his sister; \"and after all\nthis time.\" She hid it, so that her husband should not see, and when he\nhad gone to his work read it with some emotion, and sent the prodigal a\nlittle money out of her dress allowance.\n\n\"A letter from Leonard!\" said the other sister, Laura, a few days later.\nShe showed it to her husband. He wrote a cruel, insolent reply, but sent\nmore money than Blanche, so Leonard soon wrote to him again.\n\nAnd during the winter the system was developed.\n\nLeonard realised that they need never starve, because it would be too\npainful for his relatives. Society is based on the family, and the\nclever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely. Without a generous thought\non either side, pounds and pounds passed. The donors disliked Leonard,\nand he grew to hate them intensely. When Laura censured his immoral\nmarriage, he thought bitterly, \"She minds that! What would she say if\nshe knew the truth?\" When Blanche s husband offered him work, he found\nsome pretext for avoiding it. He had wanted work keenly at Oniton, but\ntoo much anxiety had shattered him, he was joining the unemployable.\nWhen his brother, the lay-reader, did not reply to a letter, he wrote\nagain, saying that he and Jacky would come down to his village on foot.\nHe did not intend this as blackmail. Still the brother sent a postal\norder, and it became part of the system. And so passed his winter and\nhis spring.\n\nIn the horror there are two bright spots. He never confused the past. He\nremained alive, and blessed are those who live, if it is only to a sense\nof sinfulness. The anodyne of muddledom, by which most men blur and\nblend their mistakes, never passed Leonard s lips--\n\n        \"And if I drink oblivion of a day,\n         So shorten I the stature of my soul.\"\n\nIt is a hard saying, and a hard man wrote it, but it lies at the root of\nall character.\n\nAnd the other bright spot was his tenderness for Jacky. He pitied her\nwith nobility now--not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a\nwoman through thick and thin. He tried to be less irritable. He wondered\nwhat her hungry eyes desired--nothing that she could express, or that\nhe or any man could give her. Would she ever receive the justice that is\nmercy--the justice for by-products that the world is too busy to bestow?\nShe was fond of flowers, generous with money, and not revengeful. If she\nhad borne him a child he might have cared for her. Unmarried, Leonard\nwould never have begged; he would have flickered out and died. But the\nwhole of life is mixed. He had to provide for Jacky, and went down dirty\npaths that she might have a few feathers and the dishes of food that\nsuited her.\n\nOne day he caught sight of Margaret and her brother. He was in St.\nPaul s. He had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly\nto see a picture that had educated him in former years. But the light\nwas bad, the picture ill placed, and Time and judgment were inside him\nnow. Death alone still charmed him, with her lap of poppies, on which\nall men shall sleep. He took one glance, and turned aimlessly away\ntowards a chair. Then down the nave he saw Miss Schlegel and her\nbrother. They stood in the fairway of passengers, and their faces were\nextremely grave. He was perfectly certain that they were in trouble\nabout their sister.\n\nOnce outside--and he fled immediately--he wished that he had spoken\nto them. What was his life? What were a few angry words, or even\nimprisonment? He had done wrong--that was the true terror. Whatever they\nmight know, he would tell them everything he knew. He re-entered St.\nPaul s. But they had moved in his absence, and had gone to lay their\ndifficulties before Mr. Wilcox and Charles.\n\nThe sight of Margaret turned remorse into new channels. He desired to\nconfess, and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature, which\nis about to lose the essence of human intercourse, it did not take\nan ignoble form. He did not suppose that confession would bring him\nhappiness. It was rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle. So\ndoes the suicide yearn. The impulses are akin, and the crime of suicide\nlies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave\nbehind. Confession need harm no one--it can satisfy that test--and\nthough it was un-English, and ignored by our Anglican cathedral, Leonard\nhad a right to decide upon it.\n\nMoreover, he trusted Margaret. He wanted her hardness now. That cold,\nintellectual nature of hers would be just, if unkind. He would do\nwhatever she told him, even if he had to see Helen. That was the supreme\npunishment she would exact. And perhaps she would tell him how Helen\nwas. That was the supreme reward.\n\nHe knew nothing about Margaret, not even whether she was married to Mr.\nWilcox, and tracking her out took several days. That evening he\ntoiled through the wet to Wickham Place, where the new flats were now\nappearing. Was he also the cause of their move? Were they expelled from\nsociety on his account? Thence to a public library, but could find no\nsatisfactory Schlegel in the directory. On the morrow he searched again.\nHe hung about outside Mr. Wilcox s office at lunch time, and, as the\nclerks came out said, \"Excuse me, sir, but is your boss married?\" Most\nof them stared, some said, \"What s that to you?\" but one, who had not\nyet acquired reticence, told him what he wished. Leonard could not learn\nthe private address. That necessitated more trouble with directories\nand tubes. Ducie Street was not discovered till the Monday, the day\nthat Margaret and her husband went down on their hunting expedition to\nHowards End.\n\nHe called at about four o clock. The weather had changed, and the\nsun shone gaily on the ornamental steps--black and white marble in\ntriangles. Leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell. He\nfelt in curious health; doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside\nhis body, and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed, with his\nback propped against the wall. When the parlourmaid came he could not\nsee her face; the brown rain had descended suddenly.\n\n\"Does Mrs. Wilcox live here?\" he asked.\n\n\"She s out,\" was the answer.\n\n\"When will she be back?\"\n\n\"I ll ask,\" said the parlourmaid.\n\nMargaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name\nshould ever be rebuffed. Putting the door on the chain--for Leonard s\nappearance demanded this--she went through to the smoking-room, which\nwas occupied by Tibby. Tibby was asleep. He had had a good lunch.\nCharles Wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview. He\nsaid drowsily: \"I don t know. Hilton. Howards End. Who is it?\"\n\n\"I ll ask, sir.\"\n\n\"No, don t bother.\"\n\n\"They have taken the car to Howards End,\" said the parlourmaid to\nLeonard.\n\nHe thanked her, and asked whereabouts that place was.\n\n\"You appear to want to know a good deal,\" she remarked. But Margaret had\nforbidden her to be mysterious. She told him against her better judgment\nthat Howards End was in Hertfordshire.\n\n\"Is it a village, please?\"\n\n\"Village! It s Mr. Wilcox s private house--at least, it s one of them.\nMrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there. Hilton is the village.\"\n\n\"Yes. And when will they be back?\"\n\n\"Mr. Schlegel doesn t know. We can t know everything, can we?\" She\nshut him out, and went to attend to the telephone, which was ringing\nfuriously.\n\nHe loitered away another night of agony. Confession grew more difficult.\nAs soon as possible he went to bed. He watched a patch of moonlight\ncross the floor of their lodging, and, as sometimes happens when the\nmind is overtaxed, he fell asleep for the rest of the room, but kept\nawake for the patch of moonlight. Horrible! Then began one of those\ndisintegrating dialogues. Part of him said: \"Why horrible? It s ordinary\nlight from the moon.\" \"But it moves.\" \"So does the moon.\" \"But it is a\nclenched fist.\" \"Why not?\" \"But it is going to touch me.\" \"Let it.\" And,\nseeming to gather motion, the patch ran up his blanket. Presently a\nblue snake appeared; then another parallel to it. \"Is there life in the\nmoon?\" \"Of course.\" \"But I thought it was uninhabited.\" \"Not by Time,\nDeath, Judgment, and the smaller snakes.\" \"Smaller snakes!\" said Leonard\nindignantly and aloud. \"What a notion!\" By a rending effort of the\nwill he woke the rest of the room up. Jacky, the bed, their food, their\nclothes on the chair, gradually entered his consciousness, and the\nhorror vanished outwards, like a ring that is spreading through water.\n\n\"I say, Jacky, I m going out for a bit.\"\n\nShe was breathing regularly. The patch of light fell clear of the\nstriped blanket, and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet.\nWhy had he been afraid? He went to the window, and saw that the moon\nwas descending through a clear sky. He saw her volcanoes, and the bright\nexpanses that a gracious error has named seas. They paled, for the sun,\nwho had lit them up, was coming to light the earth. Sea of Serenity, Sea\nof Tranquillity, Ocean of the Lunar Storms, merged into one lucent drop,\nitself to slip into the sempiternal dawn. And he had been afraid of the\nmoon!\n\nHe dressed among the contending lights, and went through his money. It\nwas running low again, but enough for a return ticket to Hilton. As it\nclinked, Jacky opened her eyes.\n\n\"Hullo, Len! What ho, Len!\"\n\n\"What ho, Jacky! see you again later.\"\n\nShe turned over and slept.\n\nThe house was unlocked, their landlord being a salesman at Covent\nGarden. Leonard passed out and made his way down to the station. The\ntrain, though it did not start for an hour, was already drawn up at the\nend of the platform, and he lay down in it and slept. With the first\njolt he was in daylight; they had left the gateways of King s Cross,\nand were under blue sky. Tunnels followed, and after each the sky grew\nbluer, and from the embankment at Finsbury Park he had his first sight\nof the sun. It rolled along behind the eastern smokes--a wheel, whose\nfellow was the descending moon--and as yet it seemed the servant of the\nblue sky, not its lord. He dozed again. Over Tewin Water it was day. To\nthe left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches; to the right\nLeonard saw up into the Tewin Woods and towards the church, with its\nwild legend of immortality. Six forest trees--that is a fact--grow out\nof one of the graves in Tewin churchyard. The grave s occupant--that is\nthe legend--is an atheist, who declared that if God existed, six forest\ntrees would grow out of her grave. These things in Hertfordshire; and\nfarther afield lay the house of a hermit--Mrs. Wilcox had known him--who\nbarred himself up, and wrote prophecies, and gave all he had to the\npoor. While, powdered in between, were the villas of business men, who\nsaw life more steadily, though with the steadiness of the half-closed\neye. Over all the sun was streaming, to all the birds were singing, to\nall the primroses were yellow, and the speedwell blue, and the country,\nhowever they interpreted her, was uttering her cry of \"now.\" She did\nnot free Leonard yet, and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the\ntrain drew up at Hilton. But remorse had become beautiful.\n\nHilton was asleep, or at the earliest, breakfasting. Leonard noticed the\ncontrast when he stepped out of it into the country. Here men had been\nup since dawn. Their hours were ruled, not by a London office, but by\nthe movements of the crops and the sun. That they were men of the finest\ntype only the sentimentalists can declare. But they kept to the life of\ndaylight. They are England s hope. Clumsily they carry forward the torch\nof the sun, until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up. Half\nclodhopper, half board-school prig, they can still throw back to a\nnobler stock, and breed yeomen.\n\nAt the chalk pit a motor passed him. In it was another type, whom Nature\nfavours--the Imperial. Healthy, ever in motion, it hopes to inherit the\nearth. It breeds as quickly as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is the\ntemptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his country s\nvirtue overseas. But the Imperialist is not what he thinks or seems. He\nis a destroyer. He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism, and though his\nambitions may be fulfilled, the earth that he inherits will be grey.\n\nTo Leonard, intent on his private sin, there came the conviction of\ninnate goodness elsewhere. It was not the optimism which he had been\ntaught at school. Again and again must the drums tap, and the goblins\nstalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial. It\nwas rather paradoxical, and arose from his sorrow. Death destroys a man,\nbut the idea of death saves him--that is the best account of it that has\nyet been given. Squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in\nus, and strengthen the wings of love. They can beckon; it is not certain\nthat they will, for they are not love s servants. But they can beckon,\nand the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him.\n\nAs he approached the house all thought stopped. Contradictory notions\nstood side by side in his mind. He was terrified but happy, ashamed,\nbut had done no sin. He knew the confession: \"Mrs. Wilcox, I have done\nwrong,\" but sunrise had robbed its meaning, and he felt rather on a\nsupreme adventure.\n\nHe entered a garden, steadied himself against a motor-car that he found\nin it, found a door open and entered a house. Yes, it would be very\neasy. From a room to the left he heard voices, Margaret s amongst them.\nHis own name was called aloud, and a man whom he had never seen said,\n\"Oh, is he there? I am not surprised. I now thrash him within an inch of\nhis life.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Wilcox,\" said Leonard, \"I have done wrong.\"\n\nThe man took him by the collar and cried, \"Bring me a stick.\" Women were\nscreaming. A stick, very bright, descended. It hurt him, not where it\ndescended, but in the heart. Books fell over him in a shower. Nothing\nhad sense.\n\n\"Get some water,\" commanded Charles, who had all through kept very calm.\n\"He s shamming. Of course I only used the blade. Here, carry him out\ninto the air.\"\n\nThinking that he understood these things, Margaret obeyed him. They laid\nLeonard, who was dead, on the gravel; Helen poured water over him.\n\n\"That s enough,\" said Charles.\n\n\"Yes, murder s enough,\" said Miss Avery, coming out of the house with\nthe sword.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XLII\n\nWhen Charles left Ducie Street he had caught the first train home, but\nhad no inkling of the newest development until late at night. Then\nhis father, who had dined alone, sent for him, and in very grave tones\ninquired for Margaret.\n\n\"I don t know where she is, pater\" said Charles. \"Dolly kept back dinner\nnearly an hour for her.\"\n\n\"Tell me when she comes in.\"\n\nAnother hour passed. The servants went to bed, and Charles visited his\nfather again, to receive further instructions. Mrs. Wilcox had still not\nreturned.\n\n\"I ll sit up for her as late as you like, but she can hardly be coming.\nIsn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr. Wilcox thoughtfully--\"perhaps.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything for you, sir?\"\n\n\"Not to-night, my boy.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox liked being called sir. He raised his eyes, and gave his son\nmore open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured. He saw Charles\nas little boy and strong man in one. Though his wife had proved unstable\nhis children were left to him.\n\nAfter midnight he tapped on Charles s door. \"I can t sleep,\" he said. \"I\nhad better have a talk with you and get it over.\"\n\nHe complained of the heat. Charles took him out into the garden, and\nthey paced up and down in their dressing-gowns. Charles became very\nquiet as the story unrolled; he had known all along that Margaret was as\nbad as her sister.\n\n\"She will feel differently in the morning,\" said Mr. Wilcox, who had\nof course said nothing about Mrs. Bast. \"But I cannot let this kind of\nthing continue without comment. I am morally certain that she is with\nher sister at Howards End. The house is mine--and, Charles, it will be\nyours--and when I say that no one is to live there, I mean that no one\nis to live there. I won t have it.\" He looked angrily at the moon.\n\"To my mind this question is connected with something far greater, the\nrights of property itself.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Charles.\n\nMr. Wilcox linked his arm in his son s, but somehow liked him less as\nhe told him more. \"I don t want you to conclude that my wife and I had\nanything of the nature of a quarrel. She was only overwrought, as who\nwould not be? I shall do what I can for Helen, but on the understanding\nthat they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a sine qua\nnon.\"\n\n\"Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car?\"\n\n\"Eight or earlier. Say that you are acting as my representative, and, of\ncourse, use no violence, Charles.\"\n\nOn the morrow, as Charles returned, leaving Leonard dead upon the\ngravel, it did not seem to him that he had used violence. Death was\ndue to heart disease. His stepmother herself had said so, and even Miss\nAvery had acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword. On his\nway through the village he informed the police, who thanked him, and\nsaid there must be an inquest. He found his father in the garden shading\nhis eyes from the sun.\n\n\"It has been pretty horrible,\" said Charles gravely. \"They were there,\nand they had the man up there with them too.\"\n\n\"What--what man?\"\n\n\"I told you last night. His name was Bast.\"\n\n\"My God! is it possible?\" said Mr. Wilcox. \"In your mother s house!\nCharles, in your mother s house!\"\n\n\"I know, pater. That was what I felt. As a matter of fact, there is\nno need to trouble about the man. He was in the last stages of heart\ndisease, and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went\noff. The police are seeing about it at this moment.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox listened attentively.\n\n\"I got up there--oh, it couldn t have been more than half-past seven.\nThe Avery woman was lighting a fire for them. They were still upstairs.\nI waited in the drawing-room. We were all moderately civil and\ncollected, though I had my suspicions. I gave them your message, and\nMrs. Wilcox said,  Oh yes, I see; yes,  in that way of hers.\"\n\n\"Nothing else?\"\n\n\"I promised to tell you,  with her love,  that she was going to Germany\nwith her sister this evening. That was all we had time for.\"\n\nMr. Wilcox seemed relieved.\n\n\"Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding, for suddenly\nMrs. Wilcox screamed out his name. I recognised it, and I went for him\nin the hall. Was I right, pater? I thought things were going a little\ntoo far.\"\n\n\"Right, my dear boy? I don t know. But you would have been no son of\nmine if you hadn t. Then did he just--just--crumple up as you said?\" He\nshrunk from the simple word.\n\n\"He caught hold of the bookcase, which came down over him. So I merely\nput the sword down and carried him into the garden. We all thought he\nwas shamming. However, he s dead right enough. Awful business!\"\n\n\"Sword?\" cried his father, with anxiety in his voice. \"What sword? Whose\nsword?\"\n\n\"A sword of theirs.\"\n\n\"What were you doing with it?\"\n\n\"Well, didn t you see, pater, I had to snatch up the first thing handy.\nI hadn t a riding-whip or stick. I caught him once or twice over the\nshoulders with the flat of their old German sword.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"He pulled over the bookcase, as I said, and fell,\" said Charles, with\na sigh. It was no fun doing errands for his father, who was never quite\nsatisfied.\n\n\"But the real cause was heart disease? Of that you re sure?\"\n\n\"That or a fit. However, we shall hear more than enough at the inquest\non such unsavoury topics.\"\n\nThey went in to breakfast. Charles had a racking headache, consequent on\nmotoring before food. He was also anxious about the future, reflecting\nthat the police must detain Helen and Margaret for the inquest and\nferret the whole thing out. He saw himself obliged to leave Hilton. One\ncould not afford to live near the scene of a scandal--it was not fair on\none s wife. His comfort was that the pater s eyes were opened at last.\nThere would be a horrible smash-up, and probably a separation from\nMargaret; then they would all start again, more as they had been in his\nmother s time.\n\n\"I think I ll go round to the police-station,\" said his father when\nbreakfast was over.\n\n\"What for?\" cried Dolly, who had still not been \"told.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. Which car will you have?\"\n\n\"I think I ll walk.\"\n\n\"It s a good half-mile,\" said Charles, stepping into the garden. \"The\nsun s very hot for April. Shan t I take you up, and then, perhaps, a\nlittle spin round by Tewin?\"\n\n\"You go on as if I didn t know my own mind,\" said Mr. Wilcox fretfully.\nCharles hardened his mouth. \"You young fellows  one idea is to get into\na motor. I tell you, I want to walk; I m very fond of walking.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right; I m about the house if you want me for anything. I\nthought of not going up to the office to-day, if that is your wish.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, my boy,\" said Mr. Wilcox, and laid a hand on his sleeve.\n\nCharles did not like it; he was uneasy about his father, who did not\nseem himself this morning. There was a petulant touch about him--more\nlike a woman. Could it be that he was growing old? The Wilcoxes were not\nlacking in affection; they had it royally, but they did not know how to\nuse it. It was the talent in the napkin, and, for a warm-hearted man,\nCharles had conveyed very little joy. As he watched his father shuffling\nup the road, he had a vague regret--a wish that something had been\ndifferent somewhere--a wish (though he did not express it thus) that\nhe had been taught to say \"I\" in his youth. He meant to make up for\nMargaret s defection, but knew that his father had been very happy with\nher until yesterday. How had she done it? By some dishonest trick, no\ndoubt--but how?\n\nMr. Wilcox reappeared at eleven, looking very tired. There was to be an\ninquest on Leonard s body to-morrow, and the police required his son to\nattend.\n\n\"I expected that,\" said Charles. \"I shall naturally be the most\nimportant witness there.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XLIII\n\nOut of the turmoil and horror that had begun with Aunt Juley s illness\nand was not even to end with Leonard s death, it seemed impossible\nto Margaret that healthy life should re-emerge. Events succeeded in\na logical, yet senseless, train. People lost their humanity, and took\nvalues as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing-cards. It was natural\nthat Henry should do this and cause Helen to do that, and then think\nher wrong for doing it; natural that she herself should think him wrong;\nnatural that Leonard should want to know how Helen was, and come, and\nCharles be angry with him for coming--natural, but unreal. In this\njangle of causes and effects what had become of their true selves? Here\nLeonard lay dead in the garden, from natural causes; yet life was a\ndeep, deep river, death a blue sky, life was a house, death a wisp of\nhay, a flower, a tower, life and death were anything and everything,\nexcept this ordered insanity, where the king takes the queen, and the\nace the king. Ah, no; there was beauty and adventure behind, such as the\nman at her feet had yearned for; there was hope this side of the grave;\nthere were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now. As\na prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she, from the turmoil\nand horror of those days, caught glimpses of the diviner wheels.\n\nAnd Helen, dumb with fright, but trying to keep calm for the child s\nsake, and Miss Avery, calm, but murmuring tenderly, \"No one ever told\nthe lad he ll have a child\"--they also reminded her that horror is not\nthe end. To what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know, but there\nseemed great chance that a child would be born into the world, to take\nthe great chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers. She\nmoved through the sunlit garden, gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed and\nwhite. There was nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and\nanger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of Leonard should be\nfolded on his breast and be filled with flowers. Here was the father;\nleave it at that. Let Squalor be turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the\nstars, and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn.\n\nAnd even the influx of officials, even the return of the doctor, vulgar\nand acute, could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty. Science\nexplained people, but could not understand them. After long centuries\namong the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the\nnerves, but this would never give understanding. One could open the\nheart to Mr. Mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to\nthem, for they wanted everything down in black and white, and black and\nwhite was exactly what they were left with.\n\nThey questioned her closely about Charles. She never suspected why.\nDeath had come, and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease.\nThey asked to see her father s sword. She explained that Charles s anger\nwas natural, but mistaken. Miserable questions about Leonard followed,\nall of which she answered unfalteringly. Then back to Charles again. \"No\ndoubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death,\" she said; \"but if it wasn t\none thing it would have been another as you know.\" At last they thanked\nher and took the sword and the body down to Hilton. She began to pick up\nthe books from the floor.\n\nHelen had gone to the farm. It was the best place for her, since she\nhad to wait for the inquest. Though, as if things were not hard enough,\nMadge and her husband had raised trouble; they did not see why they\nshould receive the offscourings of Howards End. And, of course, they\nwere right. The whole world was going to be right, and amply avenge any\nbrave talk against the conventions. \"Nothing matters,\" the Schlegels had\nsaid in the past, \"except one s self-respect and that of one s friends.\"\n When the time came, other things mattered terribly. However, Madge\nhad yielded, and Helen was assured of peace for one day and night, and\nto-morrow she would return to Germany.\n\nAs for herself, she determined to go too. No message came from Henry;\nperhaps he expected her to apologise. Now that she had time to think\nover her own tragedy, she was unrepentant. She neither forgave him\nfor his behaviour nor wished to forgive him. Her speech to him seemed\nperfect. She would not have altered a word. It had to be uttered once in\na life, to adjust the lopsidedness of the world. It was spoken not only\nto her husband, but to thousands of men like him--a protest against the\ninner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age. Though\nhe would build up his life without hers, she could not apologise. He had\nrefused to connect, on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man,\nand their love must take the consequences.\n\nNo, there was nothing more to be done. They had tried not to go over the\nprecipice, but perhaps the fall was inevitable. And it comforted her to\nthink that the future was certainly inevitable; cause and effect would\ngo jangling forward to some goal doubtless, but to none that she could\nimagine. At such moments the soul retires within, to float upon the\nbosom of a deeper stream, and has communion with the dead, and sees\nthe world s glory not diminished, but different in kind to what she\nhas supposed. She alters her focus until trivial things are blurred.\nMargaret had been tending this way all the winter. Leonard s death\nbrought her to the goal. Alas! that Henry should fade away as reality\nemerged, and only her love for him should remain clear, stamped with his\nimage like the cameos we rescue out of dreams.\n\nWith unfaltering eye she traced his future. He would soon present a\nhealthy mind to the world again, and what did he or the world care if\nhe was rotten at the core? He would grow into a rich, jolly old man,\nat times a little sentimental about women, but emptying his glass\nwith anyone. Tenacious of power, he would keep Charles and the rest\ndependent, and retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age.\nHe would settle down--though she could not realise this. In her eyes\nHenry was always moving and causing others to move, until the ends of\nthe earth met. But in time he must get too tired to move, and settle\ndown. What next? The inevitable word. The release of the soul to its\nappropriate Heaven.\n\nWould they meet in it? Margaret believed in immortality for herself. An\neternal future had always seemed natural to her. And Henry believed in\nit for himself. Yet, would they meet again? Are there not rather endless\nlevels beyond the grave, as the theory that he had censured teaches?\nAnd his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as\nhers?\n\nThus gravely meditating, she was summoned by him. He sent up Crane in\nthe motor. Other servants passed like water, but the chauffeur remained,\nthough impertinent and disloyal. Margaret disliked Crane, and he knew\nit.\n\n\"Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants?\" she asked.\n\n\"He didn t say, madam.\"\n\n\"You haven t any note for me?\"\n\n\"He didn t say, madam.\"\n\nAfter a moment s thought she locked up Howards End. It was pitiable to\nsee in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever. She\nraked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals\nin the gravelled yard. She closed the windows and drew the curtains.\nHenry would probably sell the place now.\n\nShe was determined not to spare him, for nothing new had happened as far\nas they were concerned. Her mood might never have altered from yesterday\nevening. He was standing a little outside Charles s gate, and motioned\nthe car to stop. When his wife got out he said hoarsely: \"I prefer to\ndiscuss things with you outside.\"\n\n\"It will be more appropriate in the road, I am afraid,\" said Margaret.\n\"Did you get my message?\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"I am going to Germany with my sister. I must tell you now that I shall\nmake it my permanent home. Our talk last night was more important than\nyou have realised. I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you.\"\n\n\"I am extremely tired,\" said Henry, in injured tones. \"I have been\nwalking about all the morning, and wish to sit down.\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you will consent to sit on the grass.\"\n\nThe Great North Road should have been bordered all its length with\nglebe. Henry s kind had filched most of it. She moved to the scrap\nopposite, wherein were the Six Hills. They sat down on the farther side,\nso that they could not be seen by Charles or Dolly.\n\n\"Here are your keys,\" said Margaret. She tossed them towards him. They\nfell on the sunlit slope of grass, and he did not pick them up.\n\n\"I have something to tell you,\" he said gently.\n\nShe knew this superficial gentleness, this confession of hastiness, that\nwas only intended to enhance her admiration of the male.\n\n\"I don t want to hear it,\" she replied. \"My sister is going to be\nill. My life is going to be with her now. We must manage to build up\nsomething, she and I and her child.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Munich. We start after the inquest, if she is not too ill.\"\n\n\"After the inquest?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be?\"\n\n\"Yes, heart disease.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; manslaughter.\"\n\nMargaret drove her fingers through the grass. The hill beneath her moved\nas if it were alive.\n\n\"Manslaughter,\" repeated Mr. Wilcox. \"Charles may go to prison. I dare\nnot tell him. I don t know what to do--what to do. I m broken--I m\nended.\"\n\nNo sudden warmth arose in her. She did not see that to break him was her\nonly hope. She did not enfold the sufferer in her arms. But all through\nthat day and the next a new life began to move. The verdict was brought\nin. Charles was committed for trial. It was against all reason that he\nshould be punished, but the law, notwithstanding, sentenced him to three\nyears  imprisonment. Then Henry s fortress gave way. He could bear no\none but his wife; he shambled up to Margaret afterwards and asked her\nto do what she could with him. She did what seemed easiest--she took him\ndown to recruit at Howards End.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XLIV\n\nTom s father was cutting the big meadow. He passed again and again amid\nwhirring blades and sweet odours of grass, encompassing with narrowing\ncircles the sacred centre of the field. Tom was negotiating with Helen.\n\"I haven t any idea,\" she replied. \"Do you suppose baby may, Meg?\"\n\nMargaret put down her work and regarded them absently. \"What was that?\"\n she asked.\n\n\"Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay?\"\n\n\"I haven t the least notion,\" answered Margaret, and took up her work\nagain.\n\n\"Now, Tom, baby is not to stand; he is not to lie on his face; he is not\nto lie so that his head wags; he is not to be teased or tickled; and he\nis not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter. Will you be as\ncareful as all that?\"\n\nTom held out his arms.\n\n\"That child is a wonderful nursemaid,\" remarked Margaret.\n\n\"He is fond of baby. That s why he does it!\" was Helen s answer.\n\"They re going to be lifelong friends.\"\n\n\"Starting at the ages of six and one?\"\n\n\"Of course. It will be a great thing for Tom.\"\n\n\"It may be a greater thing for baby.\"\n\nFourteen months had passed, but Margaret still stopped at Howards End.\nNo better plan had occurred to her. The meadow was being recut, the\ngreat red poppies were reopening in the garden. July would follow with\nthe little red poppies among the wheat, August with the cutting of the\nwheat. These little events would become part of her year after year.\nEvery summer she would fear lest the well should give out, every\nwinter lest the pipes should freeze; every westerly gale might blow the\nwych-elm down and bring the end of all things, and so she could not read\nor talk during a westerly gale. The air was tranquil now. She and her\nsister were sitting on the remains of Evie s rockery, where the lawn\nmerged into the field.\n\n\"What a time they all are!\" said Helen. \"What can they be doing inside?\"\n Margaret, who was growing less talkative, made no answer. The noise of\nthe cutter came intermittently, like the breaking of waves. Close by\nthem a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes.\n\n\"I wish Henry was out to enjoy this,\" said Helen. \"This lovely weather\nand to be shut up in the house! It s very hard.\"\n\n\"It has to be,\" said Margaret. \"The hay fever is his chief objection\nagainst living here, but he thinks it worth while.\"\n\n\"Meg, is or isn t he ill? I can t make out.\"\n\n\"Not ill. Eternally tired. He has worked very hard all his life, and\nnoticed nothing. Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a\nthing.\"\n\n\"I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle.\"\n\n\"Dreadfully. That is why I wish Dolly had not come, too, to-day. Still,\nhe wanted them all to come. It has to be.\"\n\n\"Why does he want them?\"\n\nMargaret did not answer.\n\n\"Meg, may I tell you something? I like Henry.\"\n\n\"You d be odd if you didn t,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"I usen t to.\"\n\n\"Usen t!\" She lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past.\nThey had crossed it, always excepting Leonard and Charles. They were\nbuilding up a new life, obscure, yet gilded with tranquillity. Leonard\nwas dead; Charles had two years more in prison. One usen t always to see\nclearly before that time. It was different now.\n\n\"I like Henry because he does worry.\"\n\n\"And he likes you because you don t.\"\n\nHelen sighed. She seemed humiliated, and buried her face in her hands.\nAfter a time she said: \"About love,\" a transition less abrupt than it\nappeared.\n\nMargaret never stopped working.\n\n\"I mean a woman s love for a man. I supposed I should hang my life on\nto that once, and was driven up and down and about as if something was\nworrying through me. But everything is peaceful now; I seem cured. That\nHerr Forstmeister, whom Frieda keeps writing about, must be a noble\ncharacter, but he doesn t see that I shall never marry him or anyone. It\nisn t shame or mistrust of myself. I simply couldn t. I m ended. I used\nto be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl, and think that for good\nor evil love must be the great thing. But it hasn t been; it has been\nitself a dream. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"I do not agree. I do not.\"\n\n\"I ought to remember Leonard as my lover,\" said Helen, stepping down\ninto the field. \"I tempted him, and killed him, and it is surely the\nleast I can do. I would like to throw out all my heart to Leonard on\nsuch an afternoon as this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I\nam forgetting him.\" Her eyes filled with tears. \"How nothing seems to\nmatch--how, my darling, my precious--\" She broke off. \"Tommy!\"\n\n\"Yes, please?\"\n\n\"Baby s not to try and stand.--There s something wanting in me. I see\nyou loving Henry, and understanding him better daily, and I know\nthat death wouldn t part you in the least. But I--Is it some awful,\nappalling, criminal defect?\"\n\nMargaret silenced her. She said: \"It is only that people are far more\ndifferent than is pretended. All over the world men and women are\nworrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop.\nHere and there they have the matter out, and it comforts them. Don t\nfret yourself, Helen. Develop what you have; love your child. I do not\nlove children. I am thankful to have none. I can play with their beauty\nand charm, but that is all--nothing real, not one scrap of what there\nought to be. And others--others go farther still, and move outside\nhumanity altogether. A place, as well as a person, may catch the glow.\nDon t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end? It is part of\nthe battle against sameness. Differences, eternal differences, planted\nby God in a single family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow\nperhaps, but colour in the daily grey. Then I can t have you worrying\nabout Leonard. Don t drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but what has Leonard got out of life?\"\n\n\"Perhaps an adventure.\"\n\n\"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Not for us. But for him.\"\n\nHelen took up a bunch of grass. She looked at the sorrel, and the red\nand white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and\nthe bents that composed it. She raised it to her face.\n\n\"Is it sweetening yet?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"No, only withered.\"\n\n\"It will sweeten to-morrow.\"\n\nHelen smiled. \"Oh, Meg, you are a person,\" she said. \"Think of the\nracket and torture this time last year. But now I couldn t stop unhappy\nif I tried. What a change--and all through you!\"\n\n\"Oh, we merely settled down. You and Henry learnt to understand one\nanother and to forgive, all through the autumn and the winter.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who settled us down?\"\n\nMargaret did not reply. The scything had begun, and she took off her\npince-nez to watch it.\n\n\"You!\" cried Helen. \"You did it all, sweetest, though you re too stupid\nto see. Living here was your plan--I wanted you; he wanted you; and\neveryone said it was impossible, but you knew. Just think of our lives\nwithout you, Meg--I and baby with Monica, revolting by theory, he handed\nabout from Dolly to Evie. But you picked up the pieces, and made us a\nhome. Can t it strike you--even for a moment--that your life has been\nheroic? Can t you remember the two months after Charles s arrest, when\nyou began to act, and did all?\"\n\n\"You were both ill at the time,\" said Margaret. \"I did the obvious\nthings. I had two invalids to nurse. Here was a house, ready furnished\nand empty. It was obvious. I didn t know myself it would turn into a\npermanent home. No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the\ntangle, but things that I can t phrase have helped me.\"\n\n\"I hope it will be permanent,\" said Helen, drifting away to other\nthoughts.\n\n\"I think so. There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our\nown.\"\n\n\"All the same, London s creeping.\"\n\nShe pointed over the meadow--over eight or nine meadows, but at the end\nof them was a red rust.\n\n\"You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now,\" she continued. \"I can\nsee it from the Purbeck Downs. And London is only part of something\nelse, I m afraid. Life s going to be melted down, all over the world.\"\n\nMargaret knew that her sister spoke truly. Howards End, Oniton, the\nPurbeck Downs, the Oderberge, were all survivals, and the melting-pot\nwas being prepared for them. Logically, they had no right to be alive.\nOne s hope was in the weakness of logic. Were they possibly the earth\nbeating time?\n\n\"Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go strong for ever,\"\n she said. \"This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred\nyears. It may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement,\nbecause it will rest on the earth. All the signs are against it now, but\nI can t help hoping, and very early in the morning in the garden I feel\nthat our house is the future as well as the past.\"\n\nThey turned and looked at it. Their own memories coloured it now,\nfor Helen s child had been born in the central room of the nine. Then\nMargaret said, \"Oh, take care--!\" for something moved behind the window\nof the hall, and the door opened.\n\n\"The conclave s breaking at last. I ll go.\"\n\nIt was Paul.\n\nHelen retreated with the children far into the field. Friendly voices\ngreeted her. Margaret rose, to encounter a man with a heavy black\nmoustache.\n\n\"My father has asked for you,\" he said with hostility.\n\nShe took her work and followed him.\n\n\"We have been talking business,\" he continued, \"but I dare say you knew\nall about it beforehand.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\nClumsy of movement--for he had spent all his life in the saddle--Paul\ndrove his foot against the paint of the front door. Mrs. Wilcox gave\na little cry of annoyance. She did not like anything scratched; she\nstopped in the hall to take Dolly s boa and gloves out of a vase.\n\nHer husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining-room, and\nby his side, holding his hand rather ostentatiously, was Evie. Dolly,\ndressed in purple, sat near the window. The room was a little dark and\nairless; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the\nhay. Margaret joined the family without speaking; the five of them had\nmet already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be said.\nAverse to wasting her time, she went on sewing. The clock struck six.\n\n\"Is this going to suit everyone?\" said Henry in a weary voice. He used\nthe old phrases, but their effect was unexpected and shadowy. \"Because I\ndon t want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been\nunfair.\"\n\n\"It s apparently got to suit us,\" said Paul.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my boy. You have only to speak, and I will leave the\nhouse to you instead.\"\n\nPaul frowned ill-temperedly, and began scratching at his arm. \"As I ve\ngiven up the outdoor life that suited me, and I have come home to look\nafter the business, it s no good my settling down here,\" he said at\nlast. \"It s not really the country, and it s not the town.\"\n\n\"Very well. Does my arrangement suit you, Evie?\"\n\n\"Of course, father.\"\n\n\"And you, Dolly?\"\n\nDolly raised her faded little face, which sorrow could wither but not\nsteady. \"Perfectly splendidly,\" she said. \"I thought Charles wanted\nit for the boys, but last time I saw him he said no, because we cannot\npossibly live in this part of England again. Charles says we ought\nto change our name, but I cannot think what to, for Wilcox just suits\nCharles and me, and I can t think of any other name.\"\n\nThere was a general silence. Dolly looked nervously round, fearing that\nshe had been inappropriate. Paul continued to scratch his arm.\n\n\"Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely,\" said Henry. \"And let\neveryone understand that; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy\nand no surprise.\"\n\nMargaret did not answer. There was something uncanny in her triumph.\nShe, who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight\nthrough these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives.\n\n\"In consequence, I leave my wife no money,\" said Henry. \"That is her own\nwish. All that she would have had will be divided among you. I am also\ngiving you a great deal in my lifetime, so that you may be independent\nof me. That is her wish, too. She also is giving away a great deal of\nmoney. She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten\nyears; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew, down\nin the field. Is all that clear? Does everyone understand?\"\n\nPaul rose to his feet. He was accustomed to natives, and a very little\nshook him out of the Englishman. Feeling manly and cynical, he said:\n\"Down in the field? Oh, come! I think we might have had the whole\nestablishment, piccaninnies included.\"\n\nMrs. Cahill whispered: \"Don t, Paul. You promised you d take care.\"\n Feeling a woman of the world, she rose and prepared to take her leave.\n\nHer father kissed her. \"Good-bye, old girl,\" he said; \"don t you worry\nabout me.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, dad.\"\n\nThen it was Dolly s turn. Anxious to contribute, she laughed nervously,\nand said: \"Good-bye, Mr. Wilcox. It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox\nshould have left Margaret Howards End, and yet she get it, after all.\"\n\nFrom Evie came a sharply-drawn breath. \"Goodbye,\" she said to Margaret,\nand kissed her.\n\nAnd again and again fell the word, like the ebb of a dying sea.\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Dolly.\"\n\n\"So long, father.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my boy; always take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Wilcox.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nMargaret saw their visitors to the gate. Then she returned to her\nhusband and laid her head in his hands. He was pitiably tired. But\nDolly s remark had interested her. At last she said: \"Could you tell me,\nHenry, what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End?\"\n\nTranquilly he replied: \"Yes, she did. But that is a very old story.\nWhen she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some\nreturn, and, not being herself at the time, scribbled  Howards End  on\na piece of paper. I went into it thoroughly, and, as it was clearly\nfanciful, I set it aside, little knowing what my Margaret would be to me\nin the future.\"\n\nMargaret was silent. Something shook her life in its inmost recesses,\nand she shivered.\n\n\"I didn t do wrong, did I?\" he asked, bending down.\n\n\"You didn t, darling. Nothing has been done wrong.\"\n\nFrom the garden came laughter. \"Here they are at last!\" exclaimed Henry,\ndisengaging himself with a smile. Helen rushed into the gloom, holding\nTom by one hand and carrying her baby on the other. There were shouts of\ninfectious joy.\n\n\"The field s cut!\" Helen cried excitedly--\"the big meadow! We ve seen to\nthe very end, and it ll be such a crop of hay as never!\"\n\nWEYBRIDGE, 1908-1910.",

Develop what you have; love your child. I do not love children. I am thankful to have none. I can play with their beauty and charm, but that is all--nothing real, not one scrap of what there ought to be. And others--others go farther still, and move outside humanity altogether. A place, as well as a person, may catch the glow. Don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end? It is part of the battle against sameness. Differences, eternal differences, planted by God in a single family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow perhaps, but colour in the daily grey. Then I can t have you worrying about Leonard. Don t drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget him."
