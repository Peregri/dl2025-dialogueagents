The emphasis\nwas helped by the speaker's square wall of a forehead, which had his\neyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two\ndark caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the\nspeaker's mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set.  The emphasis was\nhelped by the speaker's voice, which was inflexible, dry, and\ndictatorial.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker's hair, which\nbristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the\nwind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of\na plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts\nstored inside.  The speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat, square\nlegs, square shoulders,   nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by\nthe throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it\nwas,   all helped the emphasis.\n\n\"In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!\"\n\nThe speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present,\nall backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of\nlittle vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial\ngallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " II\nMURDERING THE INNOCENTS\n\n\nTHOMAS GRADGRIND, sir.  A man of realities.  A man of facts and\ncalculations.  A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are\nfour, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for\nanything over.  Thomas Gradgrind, sir   peremptorily Thomas   Thomas\nGradgrind.  With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication\ntable always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of\nhuman nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.  It is a mere\nquestion of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.  You might hope to get\nsome other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or\nAugustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all\nsupposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas\nGradgrind   no, sir!\n\nIn such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether\nto his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In\nsuch terms, no doubt, substituting the words \"boys and girls,\" for \"sir,\"\nThomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers\nbefore him, who were to be filled so full of facts.\n\nIndeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before\nmentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts,\nand prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one\ndischarge.  He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim\nmechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be\nstormed away.\n\n\"Girl number twenty,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his\nsquare forefinger, \"I don't know that girl.  Who is that girl?\"\n\n\"Sissy Jupe, sir,\" explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and\ncurtseying.\n\n\"Sissy is not a name,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Don't call yourself Sissy.\nCall yourself Cecilia.\"\n\n\"It's father as calls me Sissy, sir,\" returned the young girl in a\ntrembling voice, and with another curtsey.\n\n\"Then he has no business to do it,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Tell him he\nmustn't.  Cecilia Jupe.  Let me see.  What is your father?\"\n\n\"He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his\nhand.\n\n\"We don't want to know anything about that, here.  You mustn't tell us\nabout that, here.  Your father breaks horses, don't he?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses\nin the ring, sir.\"\n\n\"You mustn't tell us about the ring, here.  Very well, then.  Describe\nyour father as a horsebreaker.  He doctors sick horses, I dare say?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, then.  He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and\nhorsebreaker.  Give me your definition of a horse.\"\n\n(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)\n\n\"Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, for\nthe general behoof of all the little pitchers.  \"Girl number twenty\npossessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals!\nSome boy's definition of a horse.  Bitzer, yours.\"\n\nThe square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer,\nperhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,\ndarting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,\nirradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the\ninclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow\ninterval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came\nin for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner\nof a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.  But,\nwhereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to\nreceive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone\nupon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same\nrays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed.\nHis cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of\nlashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something\npaler than themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped hair\nmight have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead\nand face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,\nthat he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.\n\n\"Bitzer,\" said Thomas Gradgrind.  \"Your definition of a horse.\"\n\n\"Quadruped.  Graminivorous.  Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,\nfour eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy\ncountries, sheds hoofs, too.  Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with\niron.  Age known by marks in mouth.\"  Thus (and much more) Bitzer.\n\n\"Now girl number twenty,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"You know what a horse\nis.\"\n\nShe curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have\nblushed deeper than she had blushed all this time.  Bitzer, after rapidly\nblinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the\nlight upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antenn  \nof busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down\nagain.\n\nThe third gentleman now stepped forth.  A mighty man at cutting and\ndrying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other\npeople's too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a\nsystem to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard\nof at the bar of his little Public-office, ready to fight all England.\nTo continue in fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the\nscratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an ugly\ncustomer.  He would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right,\nfollow up with his left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he\nalways fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon him neatly.  He\nwas certain to knock the wind out of common sense, and render that\nunlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.  And he had it in charge from\nhigh authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when\nCommissioners should reign upon earth.\n\n\"Very well,\" said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms.\n\"That's a horse.  Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a\nroom with representations of horses?\"\n\nAfter a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, \"Yes, sir!\"\nUpon which the other half, seeing in the gentleman's face that Yes was\nwrong, cried out in chorus, \"No, sir!\"   as the custom is, in these\nexaminations.\n\n\"Of course, No.  Why wouldn't you?\"\n\nA pause.  One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing,\nventured the answer, Because he wouldn't paper a room at all, but would\npaint it.\n\n\"You _must_ paper it,\" said the gentleman, rather warmly.\n\n\"You must paper it,\" said Thomas Gradgrind, \"whether you like it or not.\nDon't tell _us_ you wouldn't paper it.  What do you mean, boy?\"\n\n\"I'll explain to you, then,\" said the gentleman, after another and a\ndismal pause, \"why you wouldn't paper a room with representations of\nhorses.  Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in\nreality   in fact?  Do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" from one half.  \"No, sir!\" from the other.\n\n\"Of course no,\" said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong\nhalf.  \"Why, then, you are not to see anywhere, what you don't see in\nfact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don't have in fact.  What is\ncalled Taste, is only another name for Fact.\"  Thomas Gradgrind nodded\nhis approbation.\n\n\"This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,\" said the\ngentleman.  \"Now, I'll try you again.  Suppose you were going to carpet a\nroom.  Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon\nit?\"\n\nThere being a general conviction by this time that \"No, sir!\" was always\nthe right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong.\nOnly a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe.\n\n\"Girl number twenty,\" said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of\nknowledge.\n\nSissy blushed, and stood up.\n\n\"So you would carpet your room   or your husband's room, if you were a\ngrown woman, and had a husband   with representations of flowers, would\nyou?\" said the gentleman.  \"Why would you?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,\" returned the girl.\n\n\"And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have\npeople walking over them with heavy boots?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt them, sir.  They wouldn't crush and wither, if you\nplease, sir.  They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and\npleasant, and I would fancy   \"\n\n\"Ay, ay, ay!  But you mustn't fancy,\" cried the gentleman, quite elated\nby coming so happily to his point.  \"That's it!  You are never to fancy.\"\n\n\"You are not, Cecilia Jupe,\" Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, \"to do\nanything of that kind.\"\n\n\"Fact, fact, fact!\" said the gentleman.  And \"Fact, fact, fact!\" repeated\nThomas Gradgrind.\n\n\"You are to be in all things regulated and governed,\" said the gentleman,\n\"by fact.  We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of\ncommissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact,\nand of nothing but fact.  You must discard the word Fancy altogether.\nYou have nothing to do with it.  You are not to have, in any object of\nuse or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.  You don't walk\nupon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in\ncarpets.  You don't find that foreign birds and butterflies come and\nperch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds\nand butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going\nup and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.\nYou must use,\" said the gentleman, \"for all these purposes, combinations\nand modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are\nsusceptible of proof and demonstration.  This is the new discovery.  This\nis fact.  This is taste.\"\n\nThe girl curtseyed, and sat down.  She was very young, and she looked as\nif she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded.\n\n\"Now, if Mr. M'Choakumchild,\" said the gentleman, \"will proceed to give\nhis first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request,\nto observe his mode of procedure.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind was much obliged.  \"Mr. M'Choakumchild, we only wait for\nyou.\"\n\nSo, Mr. M'Choakumchild began in his best manner.  He and some one hundred\nand forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time,\nin the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte\nlegs.  He had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had\nanswered volumes of head-breaking questions.  Orthography, etymology,\nsyntax, and prosody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general\ncosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, algebra, land-surveying\nand levelling, vocal music, and drawing from models, were all at the ends\nof his ten chilled fingers.  He had worked his stony way into Her\nMajesty's most Honourable Privy Council's Schedule B, and had taken the\nbloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science,\nFrench, German, Latin, and Greek.  He knew all about all the Water Sheds\nof all the world (whatever they are), and all the histories of all the\npeoples, and all the names of all the rivers and mountains, and all the\nproductions, manners, and customs of all the countries, and all their\nboundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass.  Ah,\nrather overdone, M'Choakumchild.  If he had only learnt a little less,\nhow infinitely better he might have taught much more!\n\nHe went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike Morgiana in the\nForty Thieves: looking into all the vessels ranged before him, one after\nanother, to see what they contained.  Say, good M'Choakumchild.  When\nfrom thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by,\ndost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy\nlurking within   or sometimes only maim him and distort him!\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " III\nA LOOPHOLE\n\n\nMR. GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable\nsatisfaction.  It was his school, and he intended it to be a model.  He\nintended every child in it to be a model   just as the young Gradgrinds\nwere all models.\n\nThere were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one.  They\nhad been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little\nhares.  Almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run\nto the lecture-room.  The first object with which they had an\nassociation, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board\nwith a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it.\n\nNot that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact\nforbid!  I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle,\nwith Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood\ncaptive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.\n\nNo little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the\nmoon before it could speak distinctly.  No little Gradgrind had ever\nlearnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what\nyou are!  No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each\nlittle Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a\nProfessor Owen, and driven Charles's Wain like a locomotive\nengine-driver.  No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field\nwith that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who\nworried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet\nmore famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those\ncelebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous\nruminating quadruped with several stomachs.\n\nTo his matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind\ndirected his steps.  He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware\ntrade before he built Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a\nsuitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament.\nStone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great\ntown   called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book.\n\nA very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.  Not\nthe least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in\nthe landscape.  A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the\nprincipal windows, as its master's heavy brows overshadowed his eyes.  A\ncalculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house.  Six windows on this\nside of the door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a\ntotal of twelve in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the\nback wings.  A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight\nlike a botanical account-book.  Gas and ventilation, drainage and\nwater-service, all of the primest quality.  Iron clamps and girders,\nfire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with\nall their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire.\n\nEverything?  Well, I suppose so.  The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in\nvarious departments of science too.  They had a little conchological\ncabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical\ncabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits\nof stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the\nparent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names;\nand, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found\nhis way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at\nmore than this, what was it for good gracious goodness' sake, that the\ngreedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!\n\nTheir father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind.  He was\nan affectionate father, after his manner; but he would probably have\ndescribed himself (if he had been put, like Sissy Jupe, upon a\ndefinition) as \"an eminently practical' father.  He had a particular\npride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a\nspecial application to him.  Whatsoever the public meeting held in\nCoketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was\nsure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend\nGradgrind.  This always pleased the eminently practical friend.  He knew\nit to be his due, but his due was acceptable.\n\nHe had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which\nwas neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears\nwere invaded by the sound of music.  The clashing and banging band\nattached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its\nrest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray.  A flag, floating from the\nsummit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \"Sleary's\nHorse-riding' which claimed their suffrages.  Sleary himself, a stout\nmodern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche\nof early Gothic architecture, took the money.  Miss Josephine Sleary, as\nsome very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then\ninaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean\nflower-act.  Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders\nwhich must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to\n\"elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing\ndog Merrylegs.\"  He was also to exhibit \"his astounding feat of throwing\nseventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head,\nthus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before\nattempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such\nrapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\"\nThe same Signor Jupe was to \"enliven the varied performances at frequent\nintervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\"  Lastly, he was\nto wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William\nButton, of Tooley Street, in \"the highly novel and laughable\nhippo-comedietta of The Tailor's Journey to Brentford.\"\n\nThomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed\non as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects\nfrom his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.  But,\nthe turning of the road took him by the back of the booth, and at the\nback of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of\nstealthy attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the\nplace.\n\nThis brought him to a stop.  \"Now, to think of these vagabonds,\" said he,\n\"attracting the young rabble from a model school.\"\n\nA space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young\nrabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child\nhe knew by name, and might order off.  Phenomenon almost incredible\nthough distinctly seen, what did he then behold but his own metallurgical\nLouisa, peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board, and\nhis own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a\nhoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!\n\nDumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family\nwas thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring child, and said:\n\n\"Louisa!!  Thomas!!\"\n\nBoth rose, red and disconcerted.  But, Louisa looked at her father with\nmore boldness than Thomas did.  Indeed, Thomas did not look at him, but\ngave himself up to be taken home like a machine.\n\n\"In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, leading\neach away by a hand; \"what do you do here?\"\n\n\"Wanted to see what it was like,\" returned Louisa, shortly.\n\n\"What it was like?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\nThere was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in\nthe girl: yet, struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face, there\nwas a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a\nstarved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its\nexpression.  Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with\nuncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them,\nanalogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way.\n\nShe was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would\nseem to become a woman all at once.  Her father thought so as he looked\nat her.  She was pretty.  Would have been self-willed (he thought in his\neminently practical way) but for her bringing-up.\n\n\"Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe\nthat you, with your education and resources, should have brought your\nsister to a scene like this.\"\n\n\"I brought _him_, father,\" said Louisa, quickly.  \"I asked him to come.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it.  I am very sorry indeed to hear it.  It makes\nThomas no better, and it makes you worse, Louisa.\"\n\nShe looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek.\n\n\"You!  Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas\nand you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who\nhave been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here!\" cried\nMr. Gradgrind.  \"In this degraded position!  I am amazed.\"\n\n\"I was tired, father.  I have been tired a long time,\" said Louisa.\n\n\"Tired?  Of what?\" asked the astonished father.\n\n\"I don't know of what   of everything, I think.\"\n\n\"Say not another word,\" returned Mr. Gradgrind.  \"You are childish.  I\nwill hear no more.\"  He did not speak again until they had walked some\nhalf-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: \"What would your\nbest friends say, Louisa?  Do you attach no value to their good opinion?\nWhat would Mr. Bounderby say?\"  At the mention of this name, his daughter\nstole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character.\nHe saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast\ndown her eyes!\n\n\"What,\" he repeated presently, \"would Mr. Bounderby say?\"  All the way to\nStone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home,\nhe repeated at intervals \"What would Mr. Bounderby say?\"   as if Mr.\nBounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IV\nMR. BOUNDERBY\n\n\nNOT being Mrs. Grundy, who _was_ Mr. Bounderby?\n\nWhy, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind's bosom friend, as a\nman perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual\nrelationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.  So near\nwas Mr. Bounderby   or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.\n\nHe was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not.  A big,\nloud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.  A man made out of a coarse\nmaterial, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him.  A\nman with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples,\nand such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes\nopen, and lift his eyebrows up.  A man with a pervading appearance on him\nof being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start.  A man who could\nnever sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man.  A man who was always\nproclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his\nold ignorance and his old poverty.  A man who was the Bully of humility.\n\nA year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby\nlooked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or\neight added to it again, without surprising anybody.  He had not much\nhair.  One might have fancied he had talked it off; and that what was\nleft, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being\nconstantly blown about by his windy boastfulness.\n\nIn the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug,\nwarming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some\nobservations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his\nbirthday.  He stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring\nafternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge\nwas always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus\ntook up a commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.\n\n\"I hadn't a shoe to my foot.  As to a stocking, I didn't know such a\nthing by name.  I passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.\nThat's the way I spent my tenth birthday.  Not that a ditch was new to\nme, for I was born in a ditch.\"\n\nMrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of\nsurpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was always taking physic\nwithout any effect, and who, whenever she showed a symptom of coming to\nlife, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on\nher; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch?\n\n\"No!  As wet as a sop.  A foot of water in it,\" said Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"Enough to give a baby cold,\" Mrs. Gradgrind considered.\n\n\"Cold?  I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything\nelse, I believe, that was capable of inflammation,\" returned Mr.\nBounderby.  \"For years, ma'am, I was one of the most miserable little\nwretches ever seen.  I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and\ngroaning.  I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn't have touched me\nwith a pair of tongs.\"\n\nMrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing\nher imbecility could think of doing.\n\n\"How I fought through it, _I_ don't know,\" said Bounderby.  \"I was\ndetermined, I suppose.  I have been a determined character in later life,\nand I suppose I was then.  Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody\nto thank for my being here, but myself.\"\n\nMrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother   \n\n\"_My_ mother?  Bolted, ma'am!\" said Bounderby.\n\nMrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up.\n\n\"My mother left me to my grandmother,\" said Bounderby; \"and, according to\nthe best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the\nworst old woman that ever lived.  If I got a little pair of shoes by any\nchance, she would take 'em off and sell 'em for drink.  Why, I have known\nthat grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses\nof liquor before breakfast!\"\n\nMrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality,\nlooked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of\na small female figure, without enough light behind it.\n\n\"She kept a chandler's shop,\" pursued Bounderby, \"and kept me in an\negg-box.  That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box.  As soon as I\nwas big enough to run away, of course I ran away.  Then I became a young\nvagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me,\neverybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.  They were right;\nthey had no business to do anything else.  I was a nuisance, an\nincumbrance, and a pest.  I know that very well.\"\n\nHis pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social\ndistinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to\nbe satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast.\n\n\"I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.  Whether I was to\ndo it or not, ma'am, I did it.  I pulled through it, though nobody threw\nme out a rope.  Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,\nchief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Those are\nthe antecedents, and the culmination.  Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\nlearnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and\nwas first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the\nsteeple clock of St. Giles's Church, London, under the direction of a\ndrunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.\nTell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your\nmodel schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish\nof schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all\nright, all correct   he hadn't such advantages   but let us have hard-headed,\nsolid-fisted people   the education that made him won't do for everybody,\nhe knows well   such and such his education was, however, and you may force\nhim to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the\nfacts of his life.\"\n\nBeing heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\nstopped.  He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still\naccompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  His eminently\npractical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a\nreproachful look that plainly said, \"Behold your Bounderby!\"\n\n\"Well!\" blustered Mr. Bounderby, \"what's the matter?  What is young\nThomas in the dumps about?\"\n\nHe spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.\n\n\"We were peeping at the circus,\" muttered Louisa, haughtily, without\nlifting up her eyes, \"and father caught us.\"\n\n\"And, Mrs. Gradgrind,\" said her husband in a lofty manner, \"I should as\nsoon have expected to find my children reading poetry.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.  \"How can you, Louisa and Thomas!  I\nwonder at you.  I declare you're enough to make one regret ever having\nhad a family at all.  I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn't.  _Then_\nwhat would you have done, I should like to know?\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks.\nHe frowned impatiently.\n\n\"As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn't go and\nlook at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of\ncircuses!\" said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \"You know, as well as I do, no young\npeople have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend\nlectures about circuses.  What can you possibly want to know of circuses\nthen?  I am sure you have enough to do, if that's what you want.  With my\nhead in its present state, I couldn't remember the mere names of half the\nfacts you have got to attend to.\"\n\n\"That's the reason!\" pouted Louisa.\n\n\"Don't tell me that's the reason, because it can't be nothing of the\nsort,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \"Go and be somethingological directly.\"\nMrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her\nchildren to their studies with this general injunction to choose their\npursuit.\n\nIn truth, Mrs. Gradgrind's stock of facts in general was woefully\ndefective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial\nposition, had been influenced by two reasons.  Firstly, she was most\nsatisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \"no\nnonsense\" about her.  By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is\nprobable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human\nbeing not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.\n\nThe simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr.\nBounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without\ncollision between herself and any other fact.  So, she once more died\naway, and nobody minded her.\n\n\"Bounderby,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \"you\nare always so interested in my young people   particularly in Louisa   that I\nmake no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this\ndiscovery.  I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the\neducation of the reason of my family.  The reason is (as you know) the\nonly faculty to which education should be addressed.  \"And yet,\nBounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day,\nthough in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas's\nand Louisa's minds which is   or rather, which is not   I don't know that I\ncan express myself better than by saying   which has never been intended to\nbe developed, and in which their reason has no part.\"\n\n\"There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of\nvagabonds,\" returned Bounderby.  \"When I was a vagabond myself, nobody\nlooked with any interest at _me_; I know that.\"\n\n\"Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his\neyes on the fire, \"in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you in what.  In idle imagination.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said the eminently practical; \"I confess, however, that the\nmisgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.\"\n\n\"In idle imagination, Gradgrind,\" repeated Bounderby.  \"A very bad thing\nfor anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.  I should ask\nMrs. Gradgrind's pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very\nwell I am not a refined character.  Whoever expects refinement in _me_\nwill be disappointed.  I hadn't a refined bringing up.\"\n\n\"Whether,\" said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and\nhis cavernous eyes on the fire, \"whether any instructor or servant can\nhave suggested anything?  Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading\nanything?  Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can\nhave got into the house?  Because, in minds that have been practically\nformed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so\nincomprehensible.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit!\" cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as\nbefore, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with\nexplosive humility.  \"You have one of those strollers' children in the\nschool.\"\n\n\"Cecilia Jupe, by name,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken\nlook at his friend.\n\n\"Now, stop a bit!\" cried Bounderby again.  \"How did she come there?\"\n\n\"Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just\nnow.  She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not\nregularly belonging to our town, and   yes, you are right, Bounderby, you\nare right.\"\n\n\"Now, stop a bit!\" cried Bounderby, once more.  \"Louisa saw her when she\ncame?\"\n\n\"Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.\nBut Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind's presence.\"\n\n\"Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\" said Bounderby, \"what passed?\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor health!\" returned Mrs. Gradgrind.  \"The girl wanted to come\nto the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and\nLouisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr.\nGradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict\nthem when such was the fact!\"\n\n\"Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\" said Mr. Bounderby.  \"Turn this girl to\nthe right about, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"I am much of your opinion.\"\n\n\"Do it at once,\" said Bounderby, \"has always been my motto from a child.\nWhen I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did\nit at once.  Do you the same.  Do this at once!\"\n\n\"Are you walking?\" asked his friend.  \"I have the father's address.\nPerhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"as long as you do it\nat once!\"\n\nSo, Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat   he always threw it on, as expressing a\nman who had been far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire\nany fashion of wearing his hat   and with his hands in his pockets,\nsauntered out into the hall.  \"I never wear gloves,\" it was his custom to\nsay.  \"I didn't climb up the ladder in _them_.   Shouldn't be so high up,\nif I had.\"\n\nBeing left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind\nwent up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of the children's\nstudy and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which,\nnotwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of\nlearned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a\nroom devoted to hair-cutting.  Louisa languidly leaned upon the window\nlooking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood\nsniffing revengefully at the fire.  Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger\nGradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after\nmanufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with\nslate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions.\n\n\"It's all right now, Louisa: it's all right, young Thomas,\" said Mr.\nBounderby; \"you won't do so any more.  I'll answer for it's being all\nover with father.  Well, Louisa, that's worth a kiss, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\" returned Louisa, when she had coldly\npaused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her\ncheek towards him, with her face turned away.\n\n\"Always my pet; ain't you, Louisa?\" said Mr. Bounderby.  \"Good-bye,\nLouisa!\"\n\nHe went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had\nkissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.  She was still\ndoing this, five minutes afterwards.\n\n\"What are you about, Loo?\" her brother sulkily remonstrated.  \"You'll rub\na hole in your face.\"\n\n\"You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom.  I\nwouldn't cry!\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " V\nTHE KEYNOTE\n\n\nCOKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a\ntriumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs.\nGradgrind herself.  Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing\nour tune.\n\nIt was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the\nsmoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of\nunnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.  It was a town\nof machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of\nsmoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.  It\nhad a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling\ndye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a\nrattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the\nsteam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an\nelephant in a state of melancholy madness.  It contained several large\nstreets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like\none another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went\nin and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same\npavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as\nyesterday and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and\nthe next.\n\nThese attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work\nby which it was sustained; against them were to be set off, comforts of\nlife which found their way all over the world, and elegancies of life\nwhich made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who could scarcely\nbear to hear the place mentioned.  The rest of its features were\nvoluntary, and they were these.\n\nYou saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful.  If the\nmembers of a religious persuasion built a chapel there   as the members of\neighteen religious persuasions had done   they made it a pious warehouse of\nred brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental\nexamples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.  The solitary exception\nwas the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the\ndoor, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs.  All\nthe public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe\ncharacters of black and white.  The jail might have been the infirmary,\nthe infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been\neither, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the\ncontrary in the graces of their construction.  Fact, fact, fact,\neverywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact,\neverywhere in the immaterial.  The M'Choakumchild school was all fact,\nand the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master\nand man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in\nhospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn't state in figures, or\nshow to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the\ndearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen.\n\nA town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course\ngot on well?  Why no, not quite well.  No?  Dear me!\n\nNo.  Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like\ngold that had stood the fire.  First, the perplexing mystery of the place\nwas, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations?  Because, whoever did,\nthe labouring people did not.  It was very strange to walk through the\nstreets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous\njangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away\nfrom their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of\ntheir own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the\nchurch and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of\nconcern.  Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there\nwas a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be\nheard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning\nfor acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main\nforce.  Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these same\npeople _would_ get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did\nget drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine\n(except a medal), would induce them to forego their custom of getting\ndrunk.  Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular\nstatements, showing that when they didn't get drunk, they took opium.\nThen came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular\nstatements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing\nthat the same people _would_ resort to low haunts, hidden from the public\neye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined\nin it; and where A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for\neighteen months' solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever shown\nhimself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as he was\nperfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip-top\nmoral specimen.  Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two\ngentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both\neminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular\nstatements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by\ncases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared   in short,\nit was the only clear thing in the case   that these same people were a bad\nlot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were\nnever thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen;\nthat they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the best, and\nbought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but\nprime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and\nunmanageable.  In short, it was the moral of the old nursery fable:\n\n    There was an old woman, and what do you think?\n    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;\n    Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,\n    And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.\n\nIs it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of\nthe Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?  Surely,\nnone of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be\ntold at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the\nexistence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years,\ndeliberately set at nought?  That there was any Fancy in them demanding\nto be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in\nconvulsions?  That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and\nmonotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical relief   some\nrelaxation, encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a\nvent   some recognized holiday, though it were but for an honest dance to a\nstirring band of music   some occasional light pie in which even\nM'Choakumchild had no finger   which craving must and would be satisfied\naright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the\nCreation were repealed?\n\n\"This man lives at Pod's End, and I don't quite know Pod's End,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind.  \"Which is it, Bounderby?\"\n\nMr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more\nrespecting it.  So they stopped for a moment, looking about.\n\nAlmost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street\nat a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind\nrecognized.  \"Halloa!\" said he.  \"Stop!  Where are you going! Stop!\"\nGirl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey.\n\n\"Why are you tearing about the streets,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"in this\nimproper manner?\"\n\n\"I was   I was run after, sir,\" the girl panted, \"and I wanted to get\naway.\"\n\n\"Run after?\" repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Who would run after _you_?\"\n\nThe question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the\ncolourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed\nand so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought\nhimself up against Mr. Gradgrind's waistcoat and rebounded into the road.\n\n\"What do you mean, boy?\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"What are you doing?  How\ndare you dash against   everybody   in this manner?\"  Bitzer picked up his\ncap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his\nforehead, pleaded that it was an accident.\n\n\"Was this boy running after you, Jupe?\" asked Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the girl reluctantly.\n\n\"No, I wasn't, sir!\" cried Bitzer.  \"Not till she run away from me.  But\nthe horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they're famous for it.\nYou know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,\"\naddressing Sissy.  \"It's as well known in the town as   please, sir, as the\nmultiplication table isn't known to the horse-riders.\"  Bitzer tried Mr.\nBounderby with this.\n\n\"He frightened me so,\" said the girl, \"with his cruel faces!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Bitzer.  \"Oh!  An't you one of the rest!  An't you a\nhorse-rider!  I never looked at her, sir.  I asked her if she would know\nhow to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she\nran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to answer\nwhen she was asked.  You wouldn't have thought of saying such mischief if\nyou hadn't been a horse-rider?\"\n\n\"Her calling seems to be pretty well known among 'em,\" observed Mr.\nBounderby.  \"You'd have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a\nweek.\"\n\n\"Truly, I think so,\" returned his friend.  \"Bitzer, turn you about and\ntake yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.  Let me hear of your\nrunning in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the\nmaster of the school.  You understand what I mean.  Go along.\"\n\nThe boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again,\nglanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated.\n\n\"Now, girl,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"take this gentleman and me to your\nfather's; we are going there.  What have you got in that bottle you are\ncarrying?\"\n\n\"Gin,\" said Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"Dear, no, sir!  It's the nine oils.\"\n\n\"The what?\" cried Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, \"what the devil do\nyou rub your father with nine oils for?\"\n\n\"It's what our people aways use, sir, when they get any hurts in the\nring,\" replied the girl, looking over her shoulder, to assure herself\nthat her pursuer was gone.  \"They bruise themselves very bad sometimes.\"\n\n\"Serve 'em right,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"for being idle.\"  She glanced up\nat his face, with mingled astonishment and dread.\n\n\"By George!\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"when I was four or five years younger\nthan you, I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty\noils, would have rubbed off.  I didn't get 'em by posture-making, but by\nbeing banged about.  There was no rope-dancing for me; I danced on the\nbare ground and was larruped with the rope.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr.\nBounderby.  His character was not unkind, all things considered; it might\nhave been a very kind one indeed, if he had only made some round mistake\nin the arithmetic that balanced it, years ago.  He said, in what he meant\nfor a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, \"And this is\nPod's End; is it, Jupe?\"\n\n\"This is it, sir, and   if you wouldn't mind, sir   this is the house.\"\n\nShe stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public-house, with\ndim red lights in it.  As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of\ncustom, it had itself taken to drinking, and had gone the way all\ndrunkards go, and was very near the end of it.\n\n\"It's only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if you wouldn't\nmind, and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle.  If you should\nhear a dog, sir, it's only Merrylegs, and he only barks.\"\n\n\"Merrylegs and nine oils, eh!\" said Mr. Bounderby, entering last with his\nmetallic laugh.  \"Pretty well this, for a self-made man!\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VI\nSLEARY'S HORSEMANSHIP\n\n\nTHE name of the public-house was the Pegasus's Arms.  The Pegasus's legs\nmight have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse\nupon the sign-board, the Pegasus's Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.\nBeneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had\ntouched off the lines:\n\n    Good malt makes good beer,\n    Walk in, and they'll draw it here;\n    Good wine makes good brandy,\n    Give us a call, and you'll find it handy.\n\nFramed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another\nPegasus   a theatrical one   with real gauze let in for his wings, golden\nstars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk.\n\nAs it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not\ngrown light enough within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr.\nBounderby received no offence from these idealities.  They followed the\ngirl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in\nthe dark while she went on for a candle.  They expected every moment to\nhear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not\nbarked when the girl and the candle appeared together.\n\n\"Father is not in our room, sir,\" she said, with a face of great\nsurprise.  \"If you wouldn't mind walking in, I'll find him directly.\"\nThey walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with\na quick light step.  It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed\nin it.  The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock's feathers and\na pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon\nenlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and\nretorts, hung upon a nail; but no other portion of his wardrobe, or other\ntoken of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.  As to\nMerrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who\nwent aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any\nsign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus's Arms.\n\nThey heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as Sissy went\nfrom one to another in quest of her father; and presently they heard\nvoices expressing surprise.  She came bounding down again in a great\nhurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it empty, and\nlooked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror.\n\n\"Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.  I don't know why he\nshould go there, but he must be there; I'll bring him in a minute!\"  She\nwas gone directly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish hair\nstreaming behind her.\n\n\"What does she mean!\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Back in a minute?  It's more\nthan a mile off.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and\nintroducing himself with the words, \"By your leaves, gentlemen!\" walked\nin with his hands in his pockets.  His face, close-shaven, thin, and\nsallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll\nall round his head, and parted up the centre.  His legs were very robust,\nbut shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.  His chest\nand back were as much too broad, as his legs were too short.  He was\ndressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl\nround his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses' provender,\nand sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of\nthe stable and the play-house.  Where the one began, and the other ended,\nnobody could have told with any precision.  This gentleman was mentioned\nin the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so justly celebrated\nfor his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American\nPrairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old\nface, who now accompanied him, assisted as his infant son: being carried\nupside down over his father's shoulder, by one foot, and held by the\ncrown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his father's hand,\naccording to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be\nobserved to fondle their offspring.  Made up with curls, wreaths, wings,\nwhite bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so\npleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part\nof the spectators; but in private, where his characteristics were a\nprecocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he became of the\nTurf, turfy.\n\n\"By your leaves, gentlemen,\" said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, glancing round\nthe room.  \"It was you, I believe, that were wishing to see Jupe!\"\n\n\"It was,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"His daughter has gone to fetch him, but I\ncan't wait; therefore, if you please, I will leave a message for him with\nyou.\"\n\n\"You see, my friend,\" Mr. Bounderby put in, \"we are the kind of people\nwho know the value of time, and you are the kind of people who don't know\nthe value of time.\"\n\n\"I have not,\" retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying him from head to\nfoot, \"the honour of knowing _you_,   but if you mean that you can make\nmore money of your time than I can of mine, I should judge from your\nappearance, that you are about right.\"\n\n\"And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I should think,\" said\nCupid.\n\n\"Kidderminster, stow that!\" said Mr. Childers.  (Master Kidderminster was\nCupid's mortal name.)\n\n\"What does he come here cheeking us for, then?\" cried Master\nKidderminster, showing a very irascible temperament.  \"If you want to\ncheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.\"\n\n\"Kidderminster,\" said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, \"stow that!   Sir,\"\nto Mr. Gradgrind, \"I was addressing myself to you.  You may or you may\nnot be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that\nJupe has missed his tip very often, lately.\"\n\n\"Has   what has he missed?\" asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent\nBounderby for assistance.\n\n\"Missed his tip.\"\n\n\"Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done 'em once,\"\nsaid Master Kidderminster.  \"Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was\nloose in his ponging.\"\n\n\"Didn't do what he ought to do.  Was short in his leaps and bad in his\ntumbling,\" Mr. Childers interpreted.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"that is tip, is it?\"\n\n\"In a general way that's missing his tip,\" Mr. E. W. B. Childers\nanswered.\n\n\"Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!\"\nejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs.  \"Queer sort of company,\ntoo, for a man who has raised himself!\"\n\n\"Lower yourself, then,\" retorted Cupid.  \"Oh Lord! if you've raised\nyourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.\"\n\n\"This is a very obtrusive lad!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting\nhis brows on him.\n\n\"We'd have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were\ncoming,\" retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed.  \"It's a pity\nyou don't have a bespeak, being so particular.  You're on the Tight-Jeff,\nain't you?\"\n\n\"What does this unmannerly boy mean,\" asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in\na sort of desperation, \"by Tight-Jeff?\"\n\n\"There!  Get out, get out!\" said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend\nfrom the room, rather in the prairie manner.  \"Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff,\nit don't much signify: it's only tight-rope and slack-rope.  You were\ngoing to give me a message for Jupe?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was.\"\n\n\"Then,\" continued Mr. Childers, quickly, \"my opinion is, he will never\nreceive it.  Do you know much of him?\"\n\n\"I never saw the man in my life.\"\n\n\"I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now.  It's pretty plain to me, he's\noff.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?\"\n\n\"Ay!  I mean,\" said Mr. Childers, with a nod, \"that he has cut.  He was\ngoosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed\nto-day.  He has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he\ncan't stand it.\"\n\n\"Why has he been   so very much   Goosed?\" asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the\nword out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance.\n\n\"His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,\" said Childers.\n\"He has his points as a Cackler still, but he can't get a living out of\n_them_.\"\n\n\"A Cackler!\" Bounderby repeated.  \"Here we go again!\"\n\n\"A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,\" said Mr. E. W. B.\nChilders, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder,\nand accompanying it with a shake of his long hair   which all shook at\nonce.  \"Now, it's a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to\nknow that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with\nit.\"\n\n\"Good!\" interrupted Mr. Bounderby.  \"This is good, Gradgrind!  A man so\nfond of his daughter, that he runs away from her!  This is devilish good!\nHa! ha!  Now, I'll tell you what, young man.  I haven't always occupied\nmy present station of life.  I know what these things are.  You may be\nastonished to hear it, but my mother   ran away from _me_.\"\n\nE. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to\nhear it.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bounderby.  \"I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran\naway from me.  Do I excuse her for it?  No.  Have I ever excused her for\nit?  Not I.  What do I call her for it?  I call her probably the very\nworst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken grandmother.\nThere's no family pride about me, there's no imaginative sentimental\nhumbug about me.  I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah\nBounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call\nher if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping.  So, with this\nman.  He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that's what he is, in\nEnglish.\"\n\n\"It's all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English\nor whether in French,\" retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about.  \"I\nam telling your friend what's the fact; if you don't like to hear it, you\ncan avail yourself of the open air.  You give it mouth enough, you do;\nbut give it mouth in your own building at least,\" remonstrated E. W. B.\nwith stern irony.  \"Don't give it mouth in this building, till you're\ncalled upon.  You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his money and laughing.\n\n\"Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?\" said\nChilders.  \"Because this isn't a strong building, and too much of you\nmight bring it down!\"\n\nEyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from\na man finally disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was\nseen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied\nup in a handkerchief under his arm.  She will never believe it of him,\nbut he has cut away and left her.\"\n\n\"Pray,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"why will she never believe it of him?\"\n\n\"Because those two were one.  Because they were never asunder.  Because,\nup to this time, he seemed to dote upon her,\" said Childers, taking a\nstep or two to look into the empty trunk.  Both Mr. Childers and Master\nKidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart\nthan the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being\nstiff in the knees.  This walk was common to all the male members of\nSleary's company, and was understood to express, that they were always on\nhorseback.\n\n\"Poor Sissy!  He had better have apprenticed her,\" said Childers, giving\nhis hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box.  \"Now, he\nleaves her without anything to take to.\"\n\n\"It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express\nthat opinion,\" returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly.\n\n\"_I_ never apprenticed?  I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Indeed?\" said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been\ndefrauded of his good opinion.  \"I was not aware of its being the custom\nto apprentice young persons to   \"\n\n\"Idleness,\" Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh.  \"No, by the Lord\nHarry!  Nor I!\"\n\n\"Her father always had it in his head,\" resumed Childers, feigning\nunconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby's existence, \"that she was to be taught\nthe deuce-and-all of education.  How it got into his head, I can't say; I\ncan only say that it never got out.  He has been picking up a bit of\nreading for her, here   and a bit of writing for her, there   and a bit of\nciphering for her, somewhere else   these seven years.\"\n\nMr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked\nhis face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little\nhope, at Mr. Gradgrind.  From the first he had sought to conciliate that\ngentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl.\n\n\"When Sissy got into the school here,\" he pursued, \"her father was as\npleased as Punch.  I couldn't altogether make out why, myself, as we were\nnot stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere.  I suppose,\nhowever, he had this move in his mind   he was always half-cracked   and then\nconsidered her provided for.  If you should happen to have looked in\nto-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her\nany little service,\" said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and\nrepeating his look, \"it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very\nfortunate and well-timed.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" returned Mr. Gradgrind.  \"I came to tell him that her\nconnections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not\nattend any more.  Still, if her father really has left her, without any\nconnivance on her part   Bounderby, let me have a word with you.\"\n\nUpon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian\nwalk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,\nand softly whistling.  While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in\nMr. Bounderby's voice as \"No.  _I_ say no.  I advise you not.  I say by\nno means.\"  While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone\nthe words, \"But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which\nhas been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  Think\nof it, Bounderby, in that point of view.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the various members of Sleary's company gradually gathered\ntogether from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from\nstanding about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers,\ngradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  There were two or\nthree handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands,\nand their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,\nwho did the fairy business when required.  The father of one of the\nfamilies was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the\nfamilies on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often\nmade a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the\napex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling\ncasks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins,\nride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.  All the\nmothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope,\nand perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all\nparticular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a\nGreek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to.  They all\nassumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their\nprivate dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic\narrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have\nproduced but a poor letter on any subject.  Yet there was a remarkable\ngentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for\nany kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity\none another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much\ngenerous construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in\nthe world.\n\nLast of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man as already mentioned, with\none fixed eye, and one loose eye, a voice (if it can be called so) like\nthe efforts of a broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a\nmuddled head which was never sober and never drunk.\n\n\"Thquire!\" said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with asthma, and whose\nbreath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s, \"Your thervant!\nThith ith a bad piethe of bithnith, thith ith.  You've heard of my Clown\nand hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?\"\n\nHe addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Thquire,\" he returned, taking off his hat, and rubbing the lining\nwith his pocket-handkerchief, which he kept inside for the purpose.  \"Ith\nit your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl, Thquire?\"\n\n\"I shall have something to propose to her when she comes back,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind.\n\n\"Glad to hear it, Thquire.  Not that I want to get rid of the child, any\nmore than I want to thtand in her way.  I'm willing to take her prentith,\nthough at her age ith late.  My voithe ith a little huthky, Thquire, and\nnot eathy heard by them ath don't know me; but if you'd been chilled and\nheated, heated and chilled, chilled and heated in the ring when you wath\nyoung, ath often ath I have been, _your_ voithe wouldn't have lathted\nout, Thquire, no more than mine.\"\n\n\"I dare say not,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait?  Thall it be Therry?  Give it\na name, Thquire!\" said Mr. Sleary, with hospitable ease.\n\n\"Nothing for me, I thank you,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"Don't thay nothing, Thquire.  What doth your friend thay?  If you\nhaven't took your feed yet, have a glath of bitterth.\"\n\nHere his daughter Josephine   a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen, who\nhad been tied on a horse at two years old, and had made a will at twelve,\nwhich she always carried about with her, expressive of her dying desire\nto be drawn to the grave by the two piebald ponies   cried, \"Father, hush!\nshe has come back!\"  Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as she\nhad run out of it.  And when she saw them all assembled, and saw their\nlooks, and saw no father there, she broke into a most deplorable cry, and\ntook refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady\n(herself in the family-way), who knelt down on the floor to nurse her,\nand to weep over her.\n\n\"Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,\" said Sleary.\n\n\"O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone?  You are gone\nto try to do me some good, I know!  You are gone away for my sake, I am\nsure!  And how miserable and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor\nfather, until you come back!\"  It was so pathetic to hear her saying many\nthings of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched\nout as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it,\nthat no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby (growing impatient) took the\ncase in hand.\n\n\"Now, good people all,\" said he, \"this is wanton waste of time.  Let the\ngirl understand the fact.  Let her take it from me, if you like, who have\nbeen run away from, myself.  Here, what's your name!  Your father has\nabsconded   deserted you   and you mustn't expect to see him again as long as\nyou live.\"\n\nThey cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in that\nadvanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being\nimpressed by the speaker's strong common sense, they took it in\nextraordinary dudgeon.  The men muttered \"Shame!\" and the women \"Brute!\"\nand Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to Mr.\nBounderby.\n\n\"I tell you what, Thquire.  To thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that\nyou had better cut it thort, and drop it.  They're a very good natur'd\npeople, my people, but they're accuthtomed to be quick in their\nmovementh; and if you don't act upon my advithe, I'm damned if I don't\nbelieve they'll pith you out o' winder.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr. Gradgrind\nfound an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject.\n\n\"It is of no moment,\" said he, \"whether this person is to be expected\nback at any time, or the contrary.  He is gone away, and there is no\npresent expectation of his return.  That, I believe, is agreed on all\nhands.\"\n\n\"Thath agreed, Thquire.  Thick to that!\"  From Sleary.\n\n\"Well then.  I, who came here to inform the father of the poor girl,\nJupe, that she could not be received at the school any more, in\nconsequence of there being practical objections, into which I need not\nenter, to the reception there of the children of persons so employed, am\nprepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal.  I am willing\nto take charge of you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for you.\nThe only condition (over and above your good behaviour) I make is, that\nyou decide now, at once, whether to accompany me or remain here.  Also,\nthat if you accompany me now, it is understood that you communicate no\nmore with any of your friends who are here present.  These observations\ncomprise the whole of the case.\"\n\n\"At the thame time,\" said Sleary, \"I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho\nthat both thides of the banner may be equally theen.  If you like,\nThethilia, to be prentitht, you know the natur of the work and you know\nyour companionth.  Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you're a lying at prethent,\nwould be a mother to you, and Joth'phine would be a thithter to you.  I\ndon't pretend to be of the angel breed myself, and I don't thay but what,\nwhen you mith'd your tip, you'd find me cut up rough, and thwear an oath\nor two at you.  But what I thay, Thquire, ith, that good tempered or bad\ntempered, I never did a horthe a injury yet, no more than thwearing at\nhim went, and that I don't expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of\nlife, with a rider.  I never wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have\nthed my thay.\"\n\nThe latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind, who\nreceived it with a grave inclination of his head, and then remarked:\n\n\"The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the way of influencing\nyour decision, is, that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical\neducation, and that even your father himself (from what I understand)\nappears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that much.\"\n\nThe last words had a visible effect upon her.  She stopped in her wild\ncrying, a little detached herself from Emma Gordon, and turned her face\nfull upon her patron.  The whole company perceived the force of the\nchange, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, \"she will\ngo!\"\n\n\"Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,\" Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her; \"I\nsay no more.  Be sure you know your own mind!\"\n\n\"When father comes back,\" cried the girl, bursting into tears again after\na minute's silence, \"how will he ever find me if I go away!\"\n\n\"You may be quite at ease,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the\nwhole matter like a sum: \"you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.\nIn such a case, your father, I apprehend, must find out Mr.   \"\n\n\"Thleary.  Thath my name, Thquire.  Not athamed of it.  Known all over\nEngland, and alwayth paythe ith way.\"\n\n\"Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him know where you went.  I\nshould have no power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have\nno difficulty, at any time, in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.\nI am well known.\"\n\n\"Well known,\" assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his loose eye.  \"You're one of\nthe thort, Thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the\nhouthe.  But never mind that at prethent.\"\n\nThere was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands\nbefore her face, \"Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me\ngo away before I break my heart!\"\n\nThe women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together   it was\nsoon done, for they were not many   and to pack them in a basket which had\noften travelled with them.  Sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still\nsobbing, and covering her eyes.  Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby\nstood near the door, ready to take her away.  Mr. Sleary stood in the\nmiddle of the room, with the male members of the company about him,\nexactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his\ndaughter Josephine's performance.  He wanted nothing but his whip.\n\nThe basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and\nsmoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.  Then they pressed about\nher, and bent over her in very natural attitudes, kissing and embracing\nher: and brought the children to take leave of her; and were a\ntender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether.\n\n\"Now, Jupe,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"If you are quite determined, come!\"\n\nBut she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and\nevery one of them had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the\nprofessional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary), and give\nher a parting kiss   Master Kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature\nthere was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to\nhave harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  Mr. Sleary\nwas reserved until the last.  Opening his arms wide he took her by both\nher hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master\nmanner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid\nact; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him\ncrying.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear!\" said Sleary.  \"You'll make your fortun, I hope, and\nnone of our poor folkth will ever trouble you, I'll pound it.  I with\nyour father hadn't taken hith dog with him; ith a ill-conwenienth to have\nthe dog out of the billth.  But on thecond thoughth, he wouldn't have\nperformed without hith mathter, tho ith ath broad ath ith long!\"\n\nWith that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye, surveyed his\ncompany with his loose one, kissed her, shook his head, and handed her to\nMr. Gradgrind as to a horse.\n\n\"There the ith, Thquire,\" he said, sweeping her with a professional\nglance as if she were being adjusted in her seat, \"and the'll do you\njuthtithe.  Good-bye, Thethilia!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Cecilia!\"  \"Good-bye, Sissy!\"  \"God bless you, dear!\"  In a\nvariety of voices from all the room.\n\nBut the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her\nbosom, and he now interposed with \"Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large\nto carry; it will be of no uthe to you now.  Give it to me!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she said, in another burst of tears.  \"Oh, no!  Pray let me\nkeep it for father till he comes back!  He will want it when he comes\nback.  He had never thought of going away, when he sent me for it.  I\nmust keep it for him, if you please!\"\n\n\"Tho be it, my dear.  (You thee how it ith, Thquire!)  Farewell,\nThethilia!  My latht wordth to you ith thith, Thtick to the termth of\nyour engagement, be obedient to the Thquire, and forget uth.  But if,\nwhen you're grown up and married and well off, you come upon any\nhorthe-riding ever, don't be hard upon it, don't be croth with it, give\nit a Bethpeak if you can, and think you might do wurth.  People mutht be\namuthed, Thquire, thomehow,\" continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than\never, by so much talking; \"they can't be alwayth a working, nor yet they\ncan't be alwayth a learning.  Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht.\nI've got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I\nconthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to\nyou, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!\"\n\nThe Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the\nfixed eye of Philosophy   and its rolling eye, too   soon lost the three\nfigures and the basket in the darkness of the street.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII\nMRS. SPARSIT\n\n\nMR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his\nestablishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend.  Mrs.\nSparsit was this lady's name; and she was a prominent figure in\nattendance on Mr. Bounderby's car, as it rolled along in triumph with the\nBully of humility inside.\n\nFor, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly\nconnected.  She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady\nScadgers.  Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by\nthe mother's side what Mrs. Sparsit still called \"a Powler.\"  Strangers\nof limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not\nto know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might\nbe a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.  The\nbetter class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the\nPowlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly\nfar back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost\nthemselves   which they had rather frequently done, as respected\nhorse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the\nInsolvent Debtors' Court.\n\nThe late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother's side a Powler, married this\nlady, being by the father's side a Scadgers.  Lady Scadgers (an immensely\nfat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher's meat, and a\nmysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen\nyears) contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age,\nand chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long\nslim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.  He inherited a\nfair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and\nspent it twice over immediately afterwards.  Thus, when he died, at\ntwenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he\ndid not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the\nhoneymoon, in affluent circumstances.  That bereaved lady, fifteen years\nolder than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady\nScadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain\nherself, went out at a salary.  And here she was now, in her elderly\ndays, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows\nwhich had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby's tea as he took his\nbreakfast.\n\nIf Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess\nwhom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not\nhave made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did.  Just as it\nbelonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it\nbelonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit's.  In the measure that he would not\nallow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable\ncircumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit's juvenile career with every\npossible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over\nthat lady's path.  \"And yet, sir,\" he would say, \"how does it turn out\nafter all?  Why here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred,\nwhich she is pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah\nBounderby of Coketown!\"\n\nNay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties\ntook it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.\nIt was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby, that he not\nonly sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them.  There\nwas a moral infection of clap-trap in him.  Strangers, modest enough\nelsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a\nrampant way, of Bounderby.  They made him out to be the Royal arms, the\nUnion-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights,\nAn Englishman's house is his castle, Church and State, and God save the\nQueen, all put together.  And as often (and it was very often) as an\norator of this kind brought into his peroration,\n\n    \"Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,\n    A breath can make them, as a breath has made,\"\n\n   it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he\nhad heard of Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"you are unusually slow, sir, with\nyour breakfast this morning.\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am,\" he returned, \"I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind's whim;\"\nTom Gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speaking   as if somebody\nwere always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say Thomas,\nand he wouldn't; \"Tom Gradgrind's whim, ma'am, of bringing up the\ntumbling-girl.\"\n\n\"The girl is now waiting to know,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"whether she is to\ngo straight to the school, or up to the Lodge.\"\n\n\"She must wait, ma'am,\" answered Bounderby, \"till I know myself.  We\nshall have Tom Gradgrind down here presently, I suppose.  If he should\nwish her to remain here a day or two longer, of course she can, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Of course she can if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.\"\n\n\"I told him I would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that\nhe might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association\nwith Louisa.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bounderby?  Very thoughtful of you!\"  Mrs. Sparsit's\nCoriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her\nblack eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea.\n\n\"It's tolerably clear to _me_,\" said Bounderby, \"that the little puss can\nget small good out of such companionship.\"\n\n\"Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I'm speaking of Louisa.\"\n\n\"Your observation being limited to \"little puss,\"\" said Mrs. Sparsit,\n\"and there being two little girls in question, I did not know which might\nbe indicated by that expression.\"\n\n\"Louisa,\" repeated Mr. Bounderby.  \"Louisa, Louisa.\"\n\n\"You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.\"  Mrs. Sparsit took a\nlittle more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her\nsteaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking\nthe infernal gods.\n\n\"If you had said I was another father to Tom   young Tom, I mean, not my\nfriend Tom Gradgrind   you might have been nearer the mark.  I am going to\ntake young Tom into my office.  Going to have him under my wing, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Indeed?  Rather young for that, is he not, sir?\"  Mrs. Sparsit's \"sir,\"\nin addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting\nconsideration for herself in the use, than honouring him.\n\n\"I'm not going to take him at once; he is to finish his educational\ncramming before then,\" said Bounderby.  \"By the Lord Harry, he'll have\nenough of it, first and last!  He'd open his eyes, that boy would, if he\nknew how empty of learning _my_ young maw was, at his time of life.\"\nWhich, by the by, he probably did know, for he had heard of it often\nenough.  \"But it's extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such\nsubjects, in speaking to any one on equal terms.  Here, for example, I\nhave been speaking to you this morning about tumblers.  Why, what do\n_you_ know about tumblers?  At the time when, to have been a tumbler in\nthe mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the\nlottery to me, you were at the Italian Opera.  You were coming out of the\nItalian Opera, ma'am, in white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour,\nwhen I hadn't a penny to buy a link to light you.\"\n\n\"I certainly, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a dignity serenely\nmournful, \"was familiar with the Italian Opera at a very early age.\"\n\n\"Egad, ma'am, so was I,\" said Bounderby, \"   with the wrong side of it.  A\nhard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make, I assure you.  People\nlike you, ma'am, accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers, have no\nidea _how_ hard a paving-stone is, without trying it.  No, no, it's of no\nuse my talking to _you_ about tumblers.  I should speak of foreign\ndancers, and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords and ladies\nand honourables.\"\n\n\"I trust, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent resignation, \"it is\nnot necessary that you should do anything of that kind.  I hope I have\nlearnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life.  If I have\nacquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can\nscarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe\nit is a general sentiment.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said her patron, \"perhaps some people may be pleased to\nsay that they do like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah\nBounderby, of Coketown, has gone through.  But you must confess that you\nwere born in the lap of luxury, yourself.  Come, ma'am, you know you were\nborn in the lap of luxury.\"\n\n\"I do not, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her head, \"deny\nit.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his back\nto the fire, looking at her; she was such an enhancement of his position.\n\n\"And you were in crack society.  Devilish high society,\" he said, warming\nhis legs.\n\n\"It is true, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility\nthe very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it.\n\n\"You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,\" said Mr.\nBounderby.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon\nher.  \"It is unquestionably true.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs\nin his great satisfaction and laughed aloud.  Mr. and Miss Gradgrind\nbeing then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand,\nand the latter with a kiss.\n\n\"Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?\" asked Mr. Gradgrind.\n\nCertainly.  So Jupe was sent there.  On coming in, she curtseyed to Mr.\nBounderby, and to his friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in\nher confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit.  Observing this, the\nblustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make:\n\n\"Now, I tell you what, my girl.  The name of that lady by the teapot, is\nMrs. Sparsit.  That lady acts as mistress of this house, and she is a\nhighly connected lady.  Consequently, if ever you come again into any\nroom in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you don't behave\ntowards that lady in your most respectful manner.  Now, I don't care a\nbutton what you do to _me_, because I don't affect to be anybody.  So far\nfrom having high connections I have no connections at all, and I come of\nthe scum of the earth.  But towards that lady, I do care what you do; and\nyou shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come\nhere.\"\n\n\"I hope, Bounderby,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, \"that\nthis was merely an oversight.\"\n\n\"My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,\" said Bounderby, \"that\nthis was merely an oversight.  Very likely.  However, as you are aware,\nma'am, I don't allow of even oversights towards you.\"\n\n\"You are very good indeed, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head\nwith her State humility.  \"It is not worth speaking of.\"\n\nSissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in\nher eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind.\nShe stood looking intently at him, and Louisa stood coldly by, with her\neyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus:\n\n\"Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you\nare not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind,\nwho is rather an invalid.  I have explained to Miss Louisa   this is Miss\nLouisa   the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to\nexpressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not\nto be referred to any more.  From this time you begin your history.  You\nare, at present, ignorant, I know.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, very,\" she answered, curtseying.\n\n\"I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated;\nand you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with\nyou, of the advantages of the training you will receive.  You will be\nreclaimed and formed.  You have been in the habit now of reading to your\nfather, and those people I found you among, I dare say?\" said Mr.\nGradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping\nhis voice.\n\n\"Only to father and Merrylegs, sir.  At least I mean to father, when\nMerrylegs was always there.\"\n\n\"Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown.\n\"I don't ask about him.  I understand you to have been in the habit of\nreading to your father?\"\n\n\"O, yes, sir, thousands of times.  They were the happiest   O, of all the\nhappy times we had together, sir!\"\n\nIt was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her.\n\n\"And what,\" asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, \"did you read to\nyour father, Jupe?\"\n\n\"About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the\nGenies,\" she sobbed out; \"and about   \"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"that is enough.  Never breathe a word of\nsuch destructive nonsense any more.  Bounderby, this is a case for rigid\ntraining, and I shall observe it with interest.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Bounderby, \"I have given you my opinion already, and\nI shouldn't do as you do.  But, very well, very well.  Since you are bent\nupon it, _very_ well!\"\n\nSo, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to\nStone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.\nAnd Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits.  And Mrs. Sparsit got\nbehind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the\nevening.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VIII\nNEVER WONDER\n\n\nLET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune.\n\nWhen she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to\nbegin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying \"Tom, I\nwonder\"   upon which Mr. Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped\nforth into the light and said, \"Louisa, never wonder!\"\n\nHerein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the\nreason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and\naffections.  Never wonder.  By means of addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never\nwonder.  Bring to me, says M'Choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk,\nand I will engage that it shall never wonder.\n\nNow, besides very many babies just able to walk, there happened to be in\nCoketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against\ntime towards the infinite world, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years and\nmore.  These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about\nin any human society, the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched\none another's faces and pulled one another's hair by way of agreeing on\nthe steps to be taken for their improvement   which they never did; a\nsurprising circumstance, when the happy adaptation of the means to the\nend is considered.  Still, although they differed in every other\nparticular, conceivable and inconceivable (especially inconceivable),\nthey were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were\nnever to wonder.  Body number one, said they must take everything on\ntrust.  Body number two, said they must take everything on political\neconomy.  Body number three, wrote leaden little books for them, showing\nhow the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank, and the\nbad grown-up baby invariably got transported.  Body number four, under\ndreary pretences of being droll (when it was very melancholy indeed),\nmade the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into\nwhich it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled.  But,\nall the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder.\n\nThere was a library in Coketown, to which general access was easy.  Mr.\nGradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what the people read in this\nlibrary: a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically\nflowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements, which no diver ever\ngot to any depth in and came up sane.  It was a disheartening\ncircumstance, but a melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in\nwondering.  They wondered about human nature, human passions, human hopes\nand fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares and joys and\nsorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!  They sometimes,\nafter fifteen hours' work, sat down to read mere fables about men and\nwomen, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or less\nlike their own.  They took De Foe to their bosoms, instead of Euclid, and\nseemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by Cocker.\nMr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this\neccentric sum, and he never could make out how it yielded this\nunaccountable product.\n\n\"I am sick of my life, Loo.  I, hate it altogether, and I hate everybody\nexcept you,\" said the unnatural young Thomas Gradgrind in the\nhair-cutting chamber at twilight.\n\n\"You don't hate Sissy, Tom?\"\n\n\"I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe.  And she hates me,\" said Tom,\nmoodily.\n\n\"No, she does not, Tom, I am sure!\"\n\n\"She must,\" said Tom.  \"She must just hate and detest the whole set-out\nof us.  They'll bother her head off, I think, before they have done with\nher.  Already she's getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as   I am.\"\n\nYoung Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before\nthe fire, with his arms on the back, and his sulky face on his arms.  His\nsister sat in the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him, now\nlooking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth.\n\n\"As to me,\" said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner of ways with his sulky\nhands, \"I am a Donkey, that's what _I_ am.  I am as obstinate as one, I\nam more stupid than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should like\nto kick like one.\"\n\n\"Not me, I hope, Tom?\"\n\n\"No, Loo; I wouldn't hurt _you_.  I made an exception of you at first.  I\ndon't know what this   jolly old   Jaundiced Jail,\" Tom had paused to find a\nsufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and\nseemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of\nthis one, \"would be without you.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Tom?  Do you really and truly say so?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I do.  What's the use of talking about it!\" returned Tom,\nchafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have\nit in unison with his spirit.\n\n\"Because, Tom,\" said his sister, after silently watching the sparks\nawhile, \"as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering\nhere, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can't reconcile you\nto home better than I am able to do.  I don't know what other girls know.\nI can't play to you, or sing to you.  I can't talk to you so as to\nlighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing\nbooks that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when\nyou are tired.\"\n\n\"Well, no more do I.  I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule\ntoo, which you're not.  If father was determined to make me either a Prig\nor a Mule, and I am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I must be a\nMule.  And so I am,\" said Tom, desperately.\n\n\"It's a great pity,\" said Louisa, after another pause, and speaking\nthoughtfully out of her dark corner: \"it's a great pity, Tom.  It's very\nunfortunate for both of us.\"\n\n\"Oh!  You,\" said Tom; \"you are a girl, Loo, and a girl comes out of it\nbetter than a boy does.  I don't miss anything in you.  You are the only\npleasure I have   you can brighten even this place   and you can always lead\nme as you like.\"\n\n\"You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I can do such things, I\ndon't so much mind knowing better.  Though I do know better, Tom, and am\nvery sorry for it.\"  She came and kissed him, and went back into her\ncorner again.\n\n\"I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about,\" said Tom,\nspitefully setting his teeth, \"and all the Figures, and all the people\nwho found them out: and I wish I could put a thousand barrels of\ngunpowder under them, and blow them all up together!  However, when I go\nto live with old Bounderby, I'll have my revenge.\"\n\n\"Your revenge, Tom?\"\n\n\"I mean, I'll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and\nhear something.  I'll recompense myself for the way in which I have been\nbrought up.\"\n\n\"But don't disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom.  Mr. Bounderby thinks as\nfather thinks, and is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tom, laughing; \"I don't mind that.  I shall very well know how\nto manage and smooth old Bounderby!\"\n\nTheir shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses\nin the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as\nif the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern.  Or, a fanciful\nimagination   if such treason could have been there   might have made it out\nto be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with\ntheir future.\n\n\"What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom?  Is it a\nsecret?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tom, \"if it is a secret, it's not far off.  It's you.  You are\nhis little pet, you are his favourite; he'll do anything for you.  When\nhe says to me what I don't like, I shall say to him, \"My sister Loo will\nbe hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby.  She always used to tell me she\nwas sure you would be easier with me than this.\"  That'll bring him\nabout, or nothing will.\"\n\nAfter waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily\nrelapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and\nabout the rails of his chair, and rumpled his head more and more, until\nhe suddenly looked up, and asked:\n\n\"Have you gone to sleep, Loo?\"\n\n\"No, Tom.  I am looking at the fire.\"\n\n\"You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,\" said\nTom.  \"Another of the advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were\nreading what she asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written\nthere, \"do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr.\nBounderby's?\"\n\n\"Why, there's one thing to be said of it,\" returned Tom, pushing his\nchair from him, and standing up; \"it will be getting away from home.\"\n\n\"There is one thing to be said of it,\" Louisa repeated in her former\ncurious tone; \"it will be getting away from home.  Yes.\"\n\n\"Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to\nleave you here.  But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I\nhad better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence,\nthan where I should lose it altogether.  Don't you see?\"\n\n\"Yes, Tom.\"\n\nThe answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it,\nthat Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the\nfire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he\ncould make of it.\n\n\"Except that it is a fire,\" said Tom, \"it looks to me as stupid and blank\nas everything else looks.  What do you see in it?  Not a circus?\"\n\n\"I don't see anything in it, Tom, particularly.  But since I have been\nlooking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.\"\n\n\"Wondering again!\" said Tom.\n\n\"I have such unmanageable thoughts,\" returned his sister, \"that they\n_will_ wonder.\"\n\n\"Then I beg of you, Louisa,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, who had opened the door\nwithout being heard, \"to do nothing of that description, for goodness'\nsake, you inconsiderate girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from\nyour father.  And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head\ncontinually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and\nwhose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his\nsister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is\nnot to do it.\"\n\nLouisa denied Tom's participation in the offence; but her mother stopped\nher with the conclusive answer, \"Louisa, don't tell me, in my state of\nhealth; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically\nimpossible that you could have done it.\"\n\n\"I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks\ndropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying.  It made me think,\nafter all, how short my life would be, and how little I could hope to do\nin it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic.  \"Nonsense!\nDon't stand there and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you\nknow very well that if it was ever to reach your father's ears I should\nnever hear the last of it.  After all the trouble that has been taken\nwith you!  After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you\nhave seen!  After I have heard you myself, when the whole of my right\nside has been benumbed, going on with your master about combustion, and\ncalcination, and calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that\ncould drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd\nway about sparks and ashes!  I wish,\" whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, taking a\nchair, and discharging her strongest point before succumbing under these\nmere shadows of facts, \"yes, I really _do_ wish that I had never had a\nfamily, and then you would have known what it was to do without me!\"\n\n\n\n",

After all the trouble that has been taken with you!  After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you have seen!  After I have heard you myself, when the whole of my right side has been benumbed, going on with your master about combustion, and calcination, and calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes!

        "raw text": " IX\nSISSY'S PROGRESS\n\n\nSISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M'Choakumchild and\nMrs. Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months\nof her probation, to run away.  It hailed facts all day long so very\nhard, and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled\nciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run away, but for only one\nrestraint.\n\nIt is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no\narithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation,\nand went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would\nhave drawn up from the premises.  The girl believed that her father had\nnot deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and in\nthe faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she\nwas.\n\nThe wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation,\nrejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis,\nthat her father was an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with\npity.  Yet, what was to be done?  M'Choakumchild reported that she had a\nvery dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of\nthe globe, she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact\nmeasurements; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates,\nunless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith; that she\nwould burst into tears on being required (by the mental process)\nimmediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps\nat fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she was as low down, in the school, as\nlow could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of\nPolitical Economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler\nthree feet high, for returning to the question, \"What is the first\nprinciple of this science?\" the absurd answer, \"To do unto others as I\nwould that they should do unto me.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was very bad;\nthat it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of\nknowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular\nstatements A to Z; and that Jupe \"must be kept to it.\"  So Jupe was kept\nto it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser.\n\n\"It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!\" she said, one night,\nwhen Louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day\nsomething clearer to her.\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I should know so much, Miss Louisa.  All that is difficult to me now,\nwould be so easy then.\"\n\n\"You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\"\n\nSissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \"I should not be the worse,\nMiss Louisa.\"  To which Miss Louisa answered, \"I don't know that.\"\n\nThere had been so little communication between these two   both because\nlife at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery\nwhich discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition\nrelative to Sissy's past career   that they were still almost strangers.\nSissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa's face, was\nuncertain whether to say more or to remain silent.\n\n\"You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can\never be,\" Louisa resumed.  \"You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am\nto _my_self.\"\n\n\"But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\" Sissy pleaded, \"I am   O so stupid!\"\n\nLouisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser\nby-and-by.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Sissy, half crying, \"what a stupid girl I am.  All\nthrough school hours I make mistakes.  Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild call\nme up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes.  I can't help\nthem.  They seem to come natural to me.\"\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I\nsuppose, Sissy?\"\n\n\"O no!\" she eagerly returned.  \"They know everything.\"\n\n\"Tell me some of your mistakes.\"\n\n\"I am almost ashamed,\" said Sissy, with reluctance.  \"But to-day, for\ninstance, Mr. M'Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural\nProsperity.\"\n\n\"National, I think it must have been,\" observed Louisa.\n\n\"Yes, it was.   But isn't it the same?\" she timidly asked.\n\n\"You had better say, National, as he said so,\" returned Louisa, with her\ndry reserve.\n\n\"National Prosperity.  And he said, Now, this schoolroom is a Nation.\nAnd in this nation, there are fifty millions of money.  Isn't this a\nprosperous nation?  Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation,\nand a'n't you in a thriving state?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked Louisa.\n\n\"Miss Louisa, I said I didn't know.  I thought I couldn't know whether it\nwas a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or\nnot, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.\nBut that had nothing to do with it.  It was not in the figures at all,\"\nsaid Sissy, wiping her eyes.\n\n\"That was a great mistake of yours,\" observed Louisa.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now.  Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he\nwould try me again.  And he said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and\nin it there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are\nstarved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.  What is your\nremark on that proportion?  And my remark was   for I couldn't think of a\nbetter one   that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were\nstarved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.  And\nthat was wrong, too.\"\n\n\"Of course it was.\"\n\n\"Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he would try me once more.  And he said,\nHere are the stutterings   \"\n\n\"Statistics,\" said Louisa.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Louisa   they always remind me of stutterings, and that's\nanother of my mistakes   of accidents upon the sea.  And I find (Mr.\nM'Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went\nto sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or\nburnt to death.  What is the percentage?  And I said, Miss;\" here Sissy\nfairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest\nerror; \"I said it was nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing, Sissy?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Miss   to the relations and friends of the people who were\nkilled.  I shall never learn,\" said Sissy.  \"And the worst of all is,\nthat although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I\nam so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don't like\nit.\"\n\nLouisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed\nbefore her, until it was raised again to glance at her face.  Then she\nasked:\n\n\"Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well\ntaught too, Sissy?\"\n\nSissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that\nthey were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \"No one hears\nus; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an\ninnocent question.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Louisa,\" answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her\nhead; \"father knows very little indeed.  It's as much as he can do to\nwrite; and it's more than people in general can do to read his writing.\nThough it's plain to _me_.\"\n\n\"Your mother?\"\n\n\"Father says she was quite a scholar.  She died when I was born.  She\nwas;\" Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \"she was a\ndancer.\"\n\n\"Did your father love her?\"  Louisa asked these questions with a strong,\nwild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a\nbanished creature, and hiding in solitary places.\n\n\"O yes!  As dearly as he loves me.  Father loved me, first, for her sake.\nHe carried me about with him when I was quite a baby.  We have never been\nasunder from that time.\"\n\n\"Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\"\n\n\"Only for my good.  Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I\ndo.  When he left me for my good   he never would have left me for his\nown   I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial.  He will not be\nhappy for a single minute, till he comes back.\"\n\n\"Tell me more about him,\" said Louisa, \"I will never ask you again.\nWhere did you live?\"\n\n\"We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.\nFather's a;\" Sissy whispered the awful word, \"a clown.\"\n\n\"To make the people laugh?\" said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence.\n\n\"Yes.  But they wouldn't laugh sometimes, and then father cried.  Lately,\nthey very often wouldn't laugh, and he used to come home despairing.\nFather's not like most.  Those who didn't know him as well as I do, and\ndidn't love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.\nSometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt\nthem, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me.  He was far, far timider\nthan they thought!\"\n\n\"And you were his comfort through everything?\"\n\nShe nodded, with the tears rolling down her face.  \"I hope so, and father\nsaid I was.  It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because\nhe felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to\nbe his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be\ndifferent from him.  I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he\nwas very fond of that.  They were wrong books   I am never to speak of them\nhere   but we didn't know there was any harm in them.\"\n\n\"And he liked them?\" said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this\ntime.\n\n\"O very much!  They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm.\nAnd often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in\nwondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or\nwould have her head cut off before it was finished.\"\n\n\"And your father was always kind?  To the last?\" asked Louisa\ncontravening the great principle, and wondering very much.\n\n\"Always, always!\" returned Sissy, clasping her hands.  \"Kinder and kinder\nthan I can tell.  He was angry only one night, and that was not to me,\nbut Merrylegs.  Merrylegs;\" she whispered the awful fact; \"is his\nperforming dog.\"\n\n\"Why was he angry with the dog?\" Louisa demanded.\n\n\"Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to\njump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them   which is one\nof his tricks.  He looked at father, and didn't do it at once.\nEverything of father's had gone wrong that night, and he hadn't pleased\nthe public at all.  He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing,\nand had no compassion on him.  Then he beat the dog, and I was\nfrightened, and said, \"Father, father!  Pray don't hurt the creature who\nis so fond of you!  O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\"  And he stopped,\nand the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the\ndog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\"\n\nLouisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her\nhand, and sat down beside her.\n\n\"Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy.  Now that I have\nasked you so much, tell me the end.  The blame, if there is any blame, is\nmine, not yours.\"\n\n\"Dear Miss Louisa,\" said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \"I\ncame home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come\nhome too, from the booth.  And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as\nif he was in pain.  And I said, \"Have you hurt yourself, father?\" (as he\ndid sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \"A little, my darling.\"\nAnd when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was\ncrying.  The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first\nhe shook all over, and said nothing but \"My darling;\" and \"My love!\"\"\n\nHere Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not\nparticularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much\nof that at present.\n\n\"I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,\" observed his sister.  \"You have\nno occasion to go away; but don't interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.\"\n\n\"Oh! very well!\" returned Tom.  \"Only father has brought old Bounderby\nhome, and I want you to come into the drawing-room.  Because if you come,\nthere's a good chance of old Bounderby's asking me to dinner; and if you\ndon't, there's none.\"\n\n\"I'll come directly.\"\n\n\"I'll wait for you,\" said Tom, \"to make sure.\"\n\nSissy resumed in a lower voice.  \"At last poor father said that he had\ngiven no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and\nthat he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without\nhim all along.  I said all the affectionate things to him that came into\nmy heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him\nall about the school and everything that had been said and done there.\nWhen I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and\nkissed me a great many times.  Then he asked me to fetch some of the\nstuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best\nplace, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after\nkissing me again, he let me go.  When I had gone down-stairs, I turned\nback that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in\nat the door, and said, \"Father dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\"  Father\nshook his head and said, \"No, Sissy, no; take nothing that's known to be\nmine, my darling;\" and I left him sitting by the fire.  Then the thought\nmust have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try\nsomething for my sake; for when I came back, he was gone.\"\n\n\"I say!  Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\" Tom remonstrated.\n\n\"There's no more to tell, Miss Louisa.  I keep the nine oils ready for\nhim, and I know he will come back.  Every letter that I see in Mr.\nGradgrind's hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it\ncomes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father.  Mr. Sleary promised\nto write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him to\nkeep his word.\"\n\n\"Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\" said Tom, with an impatient\nwhistle.  \"He'll be off if you don't look sharp!\"\n\nAfter this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the\npresence of his family, and said in a faltering way, \"I beg your pardon,\nsir, for being troublesome   but   have you had any letter yet about me?\"\nLouisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and\nlook for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did.  And when Mr. Gradgrind\nregularly answered, \"No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,\" the trembling of\nSissy's lip would be repeated in Louisa's face, and her eyes would follow\nSissy with compassion to the door.  Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these\noccasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if Jupe had been properly\ntrained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound\nprinciples the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.  Yet it did seem\n(though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if fantastic hope could\ntake as strong a hold as Fact.\n\nThis observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.  As to Tom,\nhe was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is\nusually at work on number one.  As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she said\nanything on the subject, she would come a little way out of her wrappers,\nlike a feminine dormouse, and say:\n\n\"Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by that\ngirl Jupe's so perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her\ntiresome letters!  Upon my word and honour I seem to be fated, and\ndestined, and ordained, to live in the midst of things that I am never to\nhear the last of.  It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it\nappears as if I never was to hear the last of anything!\"\n\nAt about this point, Mr. Gradgrind's eye would fall upon her; and under\nthe influence of that wintry piece of fact, she would become torpid\nagain.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " X\nSTEPHEN BLACKPOOL\n\n\nI ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any\npeople upon whom the sun shines.  I acknowledge to this ridiculous\nidiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would give them a little more play.\n\nIn the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost fortifications\nof that ugly citadel, where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing\nairs and gases were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow\ncourts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into\nexistence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man's\npurpose, and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling,\nand pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of this great\nexhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for want of air to make a\ndraught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes,\nas though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be\nexpected to be born in it; among the multitude of Coketown, generically\ncalled \"the Hands,\"   a race who would have found more favour with some\npeople, if Providence had seen fit to make them only hands, or, like the\nlower creatures of the seashore, only hands and stomachs   lived a certain\nStephen Blackpool, forty years of age.\n\nStephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.  It is said that every\nlife has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a\nmisadventure or mistake in Stephen's case, whereby somebody else had\nbecome possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same\nsomebody else's thorns in addition to his own.  He had known, to use his\nwords, a peck of trouble.  He was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind\nof rough homage to the fact.\n\nA rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering expression of\nface, and a hard-looking head sufficiently capacious, on which his\niron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old Stephen might have passed for a\nparticularly intelligent man in his condition.  Yet he was not.  He took\nno place among those remarkable \"Hands,\" who, piecing together their\nbroken intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered difficult\nsciences, and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things.  He held no\nstation among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates.\nThousands of his compeers could talk much better than he, at any time.\nHe was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.  What\nmore he was, or what else he had in him, if anything, let him show for\nhimself.\n\nThe lights in the great factories, which looked, when they were\nilluminated, like Fairy palaces   or the travellers by express-train said\nso   were all extinguished; and the bells had rung for knocking off for the\nnight, and had ceased again; and the Hands, men and women, boy and girl,\nwere clattering home.  Old Stephen was standing in the street, with the\nold sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always\nproduced   the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his own head.\n\n\"Yet I don't see Rachael, still!\" said he.\n\nIt was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him, with their\nshawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to\nkeep the rain out.  He knew Rachael well, for a glance at any one of\nthese groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there.  At last,\nthere were no more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of\ndisappointment, \"Why, then, ha' missed her!\"\n\nBut, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw another of\nthe shawled figures in advance of him, at which he looked so keenly that\nperhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement   if he\ncould have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to\nlamp, brightening and fading as it went   would have been enough to tell\nhim who was there.  Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer,\nhe darted on until he was very near this figure, then fell into his\nformer walk, and called \"Rachael!\"\n\nShe turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and raising her hood\na little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated\nby a pair of very gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order\nof her shining black hair.  It was not a face in its first bloom; she was\na woman five and thirty years of age.\n\n\"Ah, lad!  'Tis thou?\"  When she had said this, with a smile which would\nhave been quite expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her\npleasant eyes, she replaced her hood again, and they went on together.\n\n\"I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Early t'night, lass?\"\n\n\"'Times I'm a little early, Stephen! 'times a little late.  I'm never to\nbe counted on, going home.\"\n\n\"Nor going t'other way, neither, 't seems to me, Rachael?\"\n\n\"No, Stephen.\"\n\nHe looked at her with some disappointment in his face, but with a\nrespectful and patient conviction that she must be right in whatever she\ndid.  The expression was not lost upon her; she laid her hand lightly on\nhis arm a moment as if to thank him for it.\n\n\"We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends, and getting to be\nsuch old folk, now.\"\n\n\"No, Rachael, thou'rt as young as ever thou wast.\"\n\n\"One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen, without 't other\ngetting so too, both being alive,\" she answered, laughing; \"but, anyways,\nwe're such old friends, and t' hide a word of honest truth fro' one\nanother would be a sin and a pity.  'Tis better not to walk too much\ntogether.  'Times, yes!  'Twould be hard, indeed, if 'twas not to be at\nall,\" she said, with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him.\n\n\"'Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.\"\n\n\"Try to think not; and 'twill seem better.\"\n\n\"I've tried a long time, and 'ta'nt got better.  But thou'rt right; 't\nmight mak fok talk, even of thee.  Thou hast been that to me, Rachael,\nthrough so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened of me\nin that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me.  Ah, lass, and a\nbright good law!  Better than some real ones.\"\n\n\"Never fret about them, Stephen,\" she answered quickly, and not without\nan anxious glance at his face.  \"Let the laws be.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, with a slow nod or two.  \"Let 'em be.  Let everything be.\nLet all sorts alone.  'Tis a muddle, and that's aw.\"\n\n\"Always a muddle?\" said Rachael, with another gentle touch upon his arm,\nas if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the\nlong ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along.  The touch had its\ninstantaneous effect.  He let them fall, turned a smiling face upon her,\nand said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh, \"Ay, Rachael, lass,\nawlus a muddle.  That's where I stick.  I come to the muddle many times\nand agen, and I never get beyond it.\"\n\nThey had walked some distance, and were near their own homes.  The\nwoman's was the first reached.  It was in one of the many small streets\nfor which the favourite undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the\none poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order\nthat those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs\nmight slide out of this working world by the windows.  She stopped at the\ncorner, and putting her hand in his, wished him good night.\n\n\"Good night, dear lass; good night!\"\n\nShe went, with her neat figure and her sober womanly step, down the dark\nstreet, and he stood looking after her until she turned into one of the\nsmall houses.  There was not a flutter of her coarse shawl, perhaps, but\nhad its interest in this man's eyes; not a tone of her voice but had its\necho in his innermost heart.\n\nWhen she was lost to his view, he pursued his homeward way, glancing up\nsometimes at the sky, where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly.\nBut, they were broken now, and the rain had ceased, and the moon\nshone,   looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces\nbelow, and casting Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest, upon the\nwalls where they were lodged.  The man seemed to have brightened with the\nnight, as he went on.\n\nHis home, in such another street as the first, saving that it was\nnarrower, was over a little shop.  How it came to pass that any people\nfound it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys, mixed\nup in its window with cheap newspapers and pork (there was a leg to be\nraffled for to-morrow-night), matters not here.  He took his end of\ncandle from a shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the counter,\nwithout disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little\nroom, and went upstairs into his lodging.\n\nIt was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under various\ntenants; but as neat, at present, as such a room could be.  A few books\nand writings were on an old bureau in a corner, the furniture was decent\nand sufficient, and, though the atmosphere was tainted, the room was\nclean.\n\nGoing to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three-legged\ntable standing there, he stumbled against something.  As he recoiled,\nlooking down at it, it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a\nsitting attitude.\n\n\"Heaven's mercy, woman!\" he cried, falling farther off from the figure.\n\"Hast thou come back again!\"\n\nSuch a woman!  A disabled, drunken creature, barely able to preserve her\nsitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor,\nwhile the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled\nhair from her face, that it only blinded her the more with the dirt upon\nit.  A creature so foul to look at, in her tatters, stains and splashes,\nbut so much fouler than that in her moral infamy, that it was a shameful\nthing even to see her.\n\nAfter an impatient oath or two, and some stupid clawing of herself with\nthe hand not necessary to her support, she got her hair away from her\neyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him.  Then she sat swaying her\nbody to and fro, and making gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed\nintended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was\nstolid and drowsy.\n\n\"Eigh, lad?  What, yo'r there?\"  Some hoarse sounds meant for this, came\nmockingly out of her at last; and her head dropped forward on her breast.\n\n\"Back agen?\" she screeched, after some minutes, as if he had that moment\nsaid it.  \"Yes!  And back agen.  Back agen ever and ever so often.  Back?\nYes, back.  Why not?\"\n\nRoused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out, she\nscrambled up, and stood supporting herself with her shoulders against the\nwall; dangling in one hand by the string, a dunghill-fragment of a\nbonnet, and trying to look scornfully at him.\n\n\"I'll sell thee off again, and I'll sell thee off again, and I'll sell\nthee off a score of times!\" she cried, with something between a furious\nmenace and an effort at a defiant dance.  \"Come awa' from th' bed!\"  He\nwas sitting on the side of it, with his face hidden in his hands.  \"Come\nawa! from 't.  'Tis mine, and I've a right to t'!\"\n\nAs she staggered to it, he avoided her with a shudder, and passed   his\nface still hidden   to the opposite end of the room.  She threw herself\nupon the bed heavily, and soon was snoring hard.  He sunk into a chair,\nand moved but once all that night.  It was to throw a covering over her;\nas if his hands were not enough to hide her, even in the darkness.\n\n\n\n",

A\nclattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all\nthe melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day's\nmonotony, were at their heavy exercise again.\n\nStephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.  A special\ncontrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked,\nto the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he\nlaboured.  Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art\nwill consign Nature to oblivion.  Set anywhere, side by side, the work of\nGOD and the work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of\nHands of very small account, will gain in dignity from the comparison.\n\nSo many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse Steam Power.\nIt is known, to the force of a single pound weight, what the engine will\ndo; but, not all the calculators of the National Debt can tell me the\ncapacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriotism or\ndiscontent, for the decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at\nany single moment in the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with\nthe composed faces and the regulated actions.  There is no mystery in it;\nthere is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them, for\never.   Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects,\nand to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means!\n\nThe day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming\nlights within.  The lights were turned out, and the work went on.  The\nrain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that\ntribe, trailed themselves upon the earth.  In the waste-yard outside, the\nsteam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the\nshining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of\nmist and rain.\n\nThe work went on, until the noon-bell rang.  More clattering upon the\npavements.  The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour.\n\nStephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets,\nhaggard and worn.  He turned from his own class and his own quarter,\ntaking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on\nwhich his principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside\nshutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps,\nBOUNDERBY (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round\nbrazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.\n\nMr. Bounderby was at his lunch.  So Stephen had expected.  Would his\nservant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him?  Message\nin return, requiring name of such Hand.  Stephen Blackpool.  There was\nnothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in.\n\nStephen Blackpool in the parlour.  Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by\nsight), at lunch on chop and sherry.  Mrs. Sparsit netting at the\nfireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup.\nIt was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit's dignity and service, not to\nlunch.  She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own\nstately person she considered lunch a weakness.\n\n\"Now, Stephen,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"what's the matter with _you_?\"\n\nStephen made a bow.  Not a servile one   these Hands will never do that!\nLord bless you, sir, you'll never catch them at that, if they have been\nwith you twenty years!   and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit,\ntucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.\n\n\"Now, you know,\" said Mr. Bounderby, taking some sherry, \"we have never\nhad any difficulty with you, and you have never been one of the\nunreasonable ones.  You don't expect to be set up in a coach and six, and\nto be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good many\nof 'em do!\"  Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole,\nimmediate, and direct object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied;\n\"and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a\ncomplaint.  Now, you know, I am certain of that, beforehand.\"\n\n\"No, sir, sure I ha' not coom for nowt o' th' kind.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his previous\nstrong conviction.  \"Very well,\" he returned.  \"You're a steady Hand, and\nI was not mistaken.  Now, let me hear what it's all about.  As it's not\nthat, let me hear what it is.  What have you got to say?  Out with it,\nlad!\"\n\nStephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit.  \"I can go, Mr.\nBounderby, if you wish it,\" said that self-sacrificing lady, making a\nfeint of taking her foot out of the stirrup.\n\nMr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension\nbefore swallowing it, and putting out his left hand.  Then, withdrawing\nhis hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop, he said to Stephen:\n\n\"Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.  You are not\nto suppose because she keeps my house for me, that she hasn't been very\nhigh up the tree   ah, up at the top of the tree!  Now, if you have got\nanything to say that can't be said before a born lady, this lady will\nleave the room.  If what you have got to say _can_ be said before a born\nlady, this lady will stay where she is.\"\n\n\"Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a born lady to year,\nsin' I were born mysen',\" was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his plate, and leaning\nback.  \"Fire away!\"\n\n\"I ha' coom,\" Stephen began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a\nmoment's consideration, \"to ask yo yor advice.  I need 't overmuch.  I\nwere married on Eas'r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree.  She were\na young lass   pretty enow   wi' good accounts of herseln.  Well!  She went\nbad   soon.  Not along of me.  Gonnows I were not a unkind husband to her.\"\n\n\"I have heard all this before,\" said Mr. Bounderby.  \"She took to\ndrinking, left off working, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and\nplayed old Gooseberry.\"\n\n\"I were patient wi' her.\"\n\n(\"The more fool you, I think,\" said Mr. Bounderby, in confidence to his\nwine-glass.)\n\n\"I were very patient wi' her.  I tried to wean her fra 't ower and ower\nagen.  I tried this, I tried that, I tried t'other.  I ha' gone home,\nmany's the time, and found all vanished as I had in the world, and her\nwithout a sense left to bless herseln lying on bare ground.  I ha' dun 't\nnot once, not twice   twenty time!\"\n\nEvery line in his face deepened as he said it, and put in its affecting\nevidence of the suffering he had undergone.\n\n\"From bad to worse, from worse to worsen.  She left me.  She disgraced\nherseln everyways, bitter and bad.  She coom back, she coom back, she\ncoom back.  What could I do t' hinder her?  I ha' walked the streets\nnights long, ere ever I'd go home.  I ha' gone t' th' brigg, minded to\nfling myseln ower, and ha' no more on't.  I ha' bore that much, that I\nwere owd when I were young.\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles, raised the\nCoriolanian eyebrows and shook her head, as much as to say, \"The great\nknow trouble as well as the small.  Please to turn your humble eye in My\ndirection.\"\n\n\"I ha' paid her to keep awa' fra' me.  These five year I ha' paid her.  I\nha' gotten decent fewtrils about me agen.  I ha' lived hard and sad, but\nnot ashamed and fearfo' a' the minnits o' my life.  Last night, I went\nhome.  There she lay upon my har-stone!  There she is!\"\n\nIn the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his distress, he\nfired for the moment like a proud man.  In another moment, he stood as he\nhad stood all the time   his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face\naddressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd,\nhalf perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very\ndifficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip;\nhis right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very\nearnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a\nlittle bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused.\n\n\"I was acquainted with all this, you know,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"except\nthe last clause, long ago.  It's a bad job; that's what it is.  You had\nbetter have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married.\nHowever, it's too late to say that.\"\n\n\"Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?\" asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"You hear what this lady asks.  Was it an unequal marriage in point of\nyears, this unlucky job of yours?\" said Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"Not e'en so.  I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\" said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity.  \"I\ninferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an\nunequal one in point of years.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that\nhad an odd sheepishness about it.  He fortified himself with a little\nmore sherry.\n\n\"Well?  Why don't you go on?\" he then asked, turning rather irritably on\nStephen Blackpool.\n\n\"I ha' coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o' this woman.\"\nStephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his\nattentive face.  Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having\nreceived a moral shock.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Bounderby, getting up to lean his back against\nthe chimney-piece.  \"What are you talking about?  You took her for better\nfor worse.\"\n\n\"I mun' be ridden o' her.  I cannot bear 't nommore.  I ha' lived under\n't so long, for that I ha' had'n the pity and comforting words o' th'\nbest lass living or dead.  Haply, but for her, I should ha' gone\nbattering mad.\"\n\n\"He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom he speaks, I fear,\nsir,\" observed Mrs. Sparsit in an undertone, and much dejected by the\nimmorality of the people.\n\n\"I do.  The lady says what's right.  I do.  I were a coming to 't.  I ha'\nread i' th' papers that great folk (fair faw 'em a'!  I wishes 'em no\nhurt!) are not bonded together for better for worst so fast, but that\nthey can be set free fro' _their_ misfortnet marriages, an' marry ower\nagen.  When they dunnot agree, for that their tempers is ill-sorted, they\nhas rooms o' one kind an' another in their houses, above a bit, and they\ncan live asunders.  We fok ha' only one room, and we can't.  When that\nwon't do, they ha' gowd an' other cash, an' they can say \"This for yo'\nan' that for me,\" an' they can go their separate ways.  We can't.  Spite\no' all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine.  So, I\nmun be ridden o' this woman, and I want t' know how?\"\n\n\"No how,\" returned Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"If I do her any hurt, sir, there's a law to punish me?\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"If I flee from her, there's a law to punish me?\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"If I marry t'oother dear lass, there's a law to punish me?\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"If I was to live wi' her an' not marry her   saying such a thing could be,\nwhich it never could or would, an' her so good   there's a law to punish\nme, in every innocent child belonging to me?\"\n\n\"Of course there is.\"\n\n\"Now, a' God's name,\" said Stephen Blackpool, \"show me the law to help\nme!\"\n\n\"Hem!  There's a sanctity in this relation of life,\" said Mr. Bounderby,\n\"and   and   it must be kept up.\"\n\n\"No no, dunnot say that, sir.  'Tan't kep' up that way.  Not that way.\n'Tis kep' down that way.  I'm a weaver, I were in a fact'ry when a chilt,\nbut I ha' gotten een to see wi' and eern to year wi'.  I read in th'\npapers every 'Sizes, every Sessions   and you read too   I know it!   with\ndismay   how th' supposed unpossibility o' ever getting unchained from one\nanother, at any price, on any terms, brings blood upon this land, and\nbrings many common married fok to battle, murder, and sudden death.  Let\nus ha' this, right understood.  Mine's a grievous case, an' I want   if yo\nwill be so good   t' know the law that helps me.\"\n\n\"Now, I tell you what!\" said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his\npockets.  \"There _is_ such a law.\"\n\nStephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his\nattention, gave a nod.\n\n\"But it's not for you at all.  It costs money.  It costs a mint of\nmoney.\"\n\n\"How much might that be?\" Stephen calmly asked.\n\n\"Why, you'd have to go to Doctors' Commons with a suit, and you'd have to\ngo to a court of Common Law with a suit, and you'd have to go to the\nHouse of Lords with a suit, and you'd have to get an Act of Parliament to\nenable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a case of\nvery plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound,\"\nsaid Mr. Bounderby.  \"Perhaps twice the money.\"\n\n\"There's no other law?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Why then, sir,\" said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that\nright hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, \"\"_tis_ a\nmuddle.  'Tis just a muddle a'toogether, an' the sooner I am dead, the\nbetter.\"\n\n(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.)\n\n\"Pooh, pooh!  Don't you talk nonsense, my good fellow,\" said Mr.\nBounderby, \"about things you don't understand; and don't you call the\nInstitutions of your country a muddle, or you'll get yourself into a real\nmuddle one of these fine mornings.  The institutions of your country are\nnot your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind\nyour piece-work.  You didn't take your wife for fast and for loose; but\nfor better for worse.  If she has turned out worse   why, all we have got\nto say is, she might have turned out better.\"\n\n\"'Tis a muddle,\" said Stephen, shaking his head as he moved to the door.\n\"'Tis a' a muddle!\"\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what!\" Mr. Bounderby resumed, as a valedictory\naddress.  \"With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions, you have been\nquite shocking this lady: who, as I have already told you, is a born\nlady, and who, as I have not already told you, has had her own marriage\nmisfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds   tens of Thousands\nof Pounds!\" (he repeated it with great relish).  \"Now, you have always\nbeen a steady Hand hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you\nplainly, that you are turning into the wrong road.  You have been\nlistening to some mischievous stranger or other   they're always about   and\nthe best thing you can do is, to come out of that.  Now you know;\" here\nhis countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; \"I can see as far into a\ngrindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I\nhad my nose well kept to it when I was young.  I see traces of the turtle\nsoup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.  Yes, I do!\" cried Mr.\nBounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning.  \"By the Lord Harry,\nI do!\"\n\nWith a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said,\n\"Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.\"  So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling\nat his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself\ninto it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup,\nlooking quite cast down by the popular vices.\n\n\n\n",

He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the\nground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon\nhis arm.\n\nIt was not the touch he needed most at such a moment   the touch that could\ncalm the wild waters of his soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest\nlove and patience could abate the raging of the sea   yet it was a woman's\nhand too.  It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered\nby time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned.  She was very\ncleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was\nnewly come from a journey.  The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted\nnoise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the\nheavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to\nwhich her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country,\nin her plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare\noccurrence.  Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of\nhis class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face   his face, which,\nlike the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes\nand hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the\nconcentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the\ndeaf   the better to hear what she asked him.\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" said the old woman, \"didn't I see you come out of that\ngentleman's house?\" pointing back to Mr. Bounderby's.  \"I believe it was\nyou, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?\"\n\n\"Yes, missus,\" returned Stephen, \"it were me.\"\n\n\"Have you   you'll excuse an old woman's curiosity   have you seen the\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, missus.\"\n\n\"And how did he look, sir?  Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?\"\nAs she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her\naction to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old\nwoman before, and had not quite liked her.\n\n\"O yes,\" he returned, observing her more attentively, \"he were all that.\"\n\n\"And healthy,\" said the old woman, \"as the fresh wind?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Stephen.  \"He were ett'n and drinking   as large and as\nloud as a Hummobee.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said the old woman, with infinite content.  \"Thank you!\"\n\nHe certainly never had seen this old woman before.  Yet there was a vague\nremembrance in his mind, as if he had more than once dreamed of some old\nwoman like her.\n\nShe walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating himself to her\nhumour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it not?  To which she\nanswered \"Eigh sure!  Dreadful busy!\"  Then he said, she came from the\ncountry, he saw?  To which she answered in the affirmative.\n\n\"By Parliamentary, this morning.  I came forty mile by Parliamentary this\nmorning, and I'm going back the same forty mile this afternoon.  I walked\nnine mile to the station this morning, and if I find nobody on the road\nto give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back to-night.  That's\npretty well, sir, at my age!\" said the chatty old woman, her eye\nbrightening with exultation.\n\n\"'Deed 'tis.  Don't do't too often, missus.\"\n\n\"No, no.  Once a year,\" she answered, shaking her head.  \"I spend my\nsavings so, once every year.  I come regular, to tramp about the streets,\nand see the gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Only to see 'em?\" returned Stephen.\n\n\"That's enough for me,\" she replied, with great earnestness and interest\nof manner.  \"I ask no more!  I have been standing about, on this side of\nthe way, to see that gentleman,\" turning her head back towards Mr.\nBounderby's again, \"come out.  But, he's late this year, and I have not\nseen him.  You came out instead.  Now, if I am obliged to go back without\na glimpse of him   I only want a glimpse   well!  I have seen you, and you\nhave seen him, and I must make that do.\"  Saying this, she looked at\nStephen as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye was not so\nbright as it had been.\n\nWith a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all submission\nto the patricians of Coketown, this seemed so extraordinary a source of\ninterest to take so much trouble about, that it perplexed him.  But they\nwere passing the church now, and as his eye caught the clock, he\nquickened his pace.\n\nHe was going to his work? the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite\neasily.  Yes, time was nearly out.  On his telling her where he worked,\nthe old woman became a more singular old woman than before.\n\n\"An't you happy?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Why   there's awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.\"  He answered\nevasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he\nwould be very happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her.\nHe knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman\nhad lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much\nthe better for her, and none the worse for him.\n\n\"Ay, ay!  You have your troubles at home, you mean?\" she said.\n\n\"Times.  Just now and then,\" he answered, slightly.\n\n\"But, working under such a gentleman, they don't follow you to the\nFactory?\"\n\nNo, no; they didn't follow him there, said Stephen.  All correct there.\nEverything accordant there.  (He did not go so far as to say, for her\npleasure, that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard\nclaims almost as magnificent of late years.)\n\nThey were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were\ncrowding in.  The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many\ncoils, and the Elephant was getting ready.  The strange old woman was\ndelighted with the very bell.  It was the beautifullest bell she had ever\nheard, she said, and sounded grand!\n\nShe asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her\nbefore going in, how long he had worked there?\n\n\"A dozen year,\" he told her.\n\n\"I must kiss the hand,\" said she, \"that has worked in this fine factory\nfor a dozen year!\"  And she lifted it, though he would have prevented\nher, and put it to her lips.  What harmony, besides her age and her\nsimplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic\naction there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something\nwhich it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done\nwith such a natural and touching air.\n\nHe had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman,\nwhen, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he\nglanced through a window which was in his corner, and saw her still\nlooking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration.  Heedless of the\nsmoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at\nit, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud\nmusic to her.\n\nShe was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the lights sprung\nup again, and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over\nthe arches near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and\nscarcely heard above its crash and rattle.  Long before then his thoughts\nhad gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the\nshameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart.\n\nMachinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.\nThe bell again; the glare of light and heat dispelled; the factories,\nlooming heavy in the black wet night   their tall chimneys rising up into\nthe air like competing Towers of Babel.\n\nHe had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true, and had walked\nwith her a little way; but he had his new misfortune on him, in which no\none else could give him a moment's relief, and, for the sake of it, and\nbecause he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which no\nvoice but hers could effect, he felt he might so far disregard what she\nhad said as to wait for her again.  He waited, but she had eluded him.\nShe was gone.  On no other night in the year could he so ill have spared\nher patient face.\n\nO!  Better to have no home in which to lay his head, than to have a home\nand dread to go to it, through such a cause.  He ate and drank, for he\nwas exhausted   but he little knew or cared what; and he wandered about in\nthe chill rain, thinking and thinking, and brooding and brooding.\n\nNo word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but Rachael had\ntaken great pity on him years ago, and to her alone he had opened his\nclosed heart all this time, on the subject of his miseries; and he knew\nvery well that if he were free to ask her, she would take him.  He\nthought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with\npleasure and pride; of the different man he might have been that night;\nof the lightness then in his now heavy-laden breast; of the then restored\nhonour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to pieces.  He thought of\nthe waste of the best part of his life, of the change it made in his\ncharacter for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his\nexistence, bound hand and foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon\nin her shape.  He thought of Rachael, how young when they were first\nbrought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon to grow\nold.  He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry, how\nmany homes with children in them she had seen grow up around her, how she\nhad contentedly pursued her own lone quiet path   for him   and how he had\nsometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face, that smote him\nwith remorse and despair.  He set the picture of her up, beside the\ninfamous image of last night; and thought, Could it be, that the whole\nearthly course of one so gentle, good, and self-denying, was subjugate to\nsuch a wretch as that!\n\nFilled with these thoughts   so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of\ngrowing larger, of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards\nthe objects among which he passed, of seeing the iris round every misty\nlight turn red   he went home for shelter.\n\n\n\n",

The inequality of Birth was nothing to it.\nFor, say that the child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born\nto-night in the same moment, what was that disparity, to the death of any\nhuman creature who was serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this\nabandoned woman lived on!\n\nFrom the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside, with\nsuspended breath and with a slow footstep.  He went up to his door,\nopened it, and so into the room.\n\nQuiet and peace were there.  Rachael was there, sitting by the bed.\n\nShe turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight\nof his mind.  She sat by the bed, watching and tending his wife.  That is\nto say, he saw that some one lay there, and he knew too well it must be\nshe; but Rachael's hands had put a curtain up, so that she was screened\nfrom his eyes.  Her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of\nRachael's were in the room.  Everything was in its place and order as he\nhad always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was\nfreshly swept.  It appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael's\nface, and looked at nothing besides.  While looking at it, it was shut\nout from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but not\nbefore he had seen how earnestly she looked at him, and how her own eyes\nwere filled too.\n\nShe turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was\nquiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice.\n\n\"I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.  You are very late.\"\n\n\"I ha' been walking up an' down.\"\n\n\"I thought so.  But 'tis too bad a night for that.  The rain falls very\nheavy, and the wind has risen.\"\n\nThe wind?  True.  It was blowing hard.  Hark to the thundering in the\nchimney, and the surging noise!  To have been out in such a wind, and not\nto have known it was blowing!\n\n\"I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen.  Landlady came round for\nme at dinner-time.  There was some one here that needed looking to, she\nsaid.  And \"deed she was right.  All wandering and lost, Stephen.\nWounded too, and bruised.\"\n\nHe slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her.\n\n\"I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked\nwith me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married\nher when I was her friend   \"\n\nHe laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan.\n\n\"And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that\n'tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want\nof aid.  Thou knowest who said, \"Let him who is without sin among you\ncast the first stone at her!\"  There have been plenty to do that.  Thou\nart not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so\nlow.\"\n\n\"O Rachael, Rachael!\"\n\n\"Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!\" she said, in\ncompassionate accents.  \"I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and\nmind.\"\n\n             [Picture: Stephen and Rachael in the sick room]\n\nThe wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the\nself-made outcast.  She dressed them now, still without showing her.  She\nsteeped a piece of linen in a basin, into which she poured some liquid\nfrom a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore.  The\nthree-legged table had been drawn close to the bedside, and on it there\nwere two bottles.  This was one.\n\nIt was not so far off, but that Stephen, following her hands with his\neyes, could read what was printed on it in large letters.  He turned of a\ndeadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him.\n\n\"I will stay here, Stephen,\" said Rachael, quietly resuming her seat,\n\"till the bells go Three.  'Tis to be done again at three, and then she\nmay be left till morning.\"\n\n\"But thy rest agen to-morrow's work, my dear.\"\n\n\"I slept sound last night.  I can wake many nights, when I am put to it.\n'Tis thou who art in need of rest   so white and tired.  Try to sleep in\nthe chair there, while I watch.  Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can\nwell believe.  To-morrow's work is far harder for thee than for me.\"\n\nHe heard the thundering and surging out of doors, and it seemed to him as\nif his late angry mood were going about trying to get at him.  She had\ncast it out; she would keep it out; he trusted to her to defend him from\nhimself.\n\n\"She don't know me, Stephen; she just drowsily mutters and stares.  I\nhave spoken to her times and again, but she don't notice!  'Tis as well\nso.  When she comes to her right mind once more, I shall have done what I\ncan, and she never the wiser.\"\n\n\"How long, Rachael, is 't looked for, that she'll be so?\"\n\n\"Doctor said she would haply come to her mind to-morrow.\"\n\nHis eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him, causing\nhim to shiver in every limb.  She thought he was chilled with the wet.\n\"No,\" he said, \"it was not that.  He had had a fright.\"\n\n\"A fright?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! coming in.  When I were walking.  When I were thinking.  When\nI   \"  It seized him again; and he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf,\nas he pressed his dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it\nwere palsied.\n\n\"Stephen!\"\n\nShe was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop her.\n\n\"No!  Don't, please; don't.  Let me see thee setten by the bed.  Let me\nsee thee, a' so good, and so forgiving.  Let me see thee as I see thee\nwhen I coom in.  I can never see thee better than so.  Never, never,\nnever!\"\n\nHe had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his chair.  After a\ntime he controlled himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and\nhis head upon that hand, could look towards Rachael.  Seen across the dim\ncandle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she had a glory shining\nround her head.  He could have believed she had.  He did believe it, as\nthe noise without shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went\nabout the house clamouring and lamenting.\n\n\"When she gets better, Stephen, 'tis to be hoped she'll leave thee to\nthyself again, and do thee no more hurt.  Anyways we will hope so now.\nAnd now I shall keep silence, for I want thee to sleep.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes, more to please her than to rest his weary head; but,\nby slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of the wind, he ceased\nto hear it, or it changed into the working of his loom, or even into the\nvoices of the day (his own included) saying what had been really said.\nEven this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a\nlong, troubled dream.\n\nHe thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long been set   but\nshe was not Rachael, and that surprised him, even in the midst of his\nimaginary happiness   stood in the church being married.  While the\nceremony was performing, and while he recognized among the witnesses some\nwhom he knew to be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness\ncame on, succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.  It broke from\none line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the\nbuilding with the words.  They were sounded through the church, too, as\nif there were voices in the fiery letters.  Upon this, the whole\nappearance before him and around him changed, and nothing was left as it\nhad been, but himself and the clergyman.  They stood in the daylight\nbefore a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could have\nbeen brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he\nthought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and there was not one\npitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his\nface.  He stood on a raised stage, under his own loom; and, looking up at\nthe shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service distinctly read,\nhe knew that he was there to suffer death.  In an instant what he stood\non fell below him, and he was gone.\n\n   Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and to places that\nhe knew, he was unable to consider; but he was back in those places by\nsome means, and with this condemnation upon him, that he was never, in\nthis world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to\nlook on Rachael's face or hear her voice.  Wandering to and fro,\nunceasingly, without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only\nknew that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a nameless,\nhorrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything\ntook.  Whatsoever he looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.  The\nobject of his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any\none among the various people he encountered.  Hopeless labour!  If he led\nthem out of rooms where it was, if he shut up drawers and closets where\nit stood, if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be\nsecreted, and got them out into the streets, the very chimneys of the\nmills assumed that shape, and round them was the printed word.\n\nThe wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the house-tops, and\nthe larger spaces through which he had strayed contracted to the four\nwalls of his room.  Saving that the fire had died out, it was as his eyes\nhad closed upon it.  Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the\nchair by the bed.  She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.  The\ntable stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its\nreal proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.\n\nHe thought he saw the curtain move.  He looked again, and he was sure it\nmoved.  He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little.  Then the\ncurtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and\nsat up.\n\nWith her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she looked\nall round the room, and passed the corner where he slept in his chair.\nHer eyes returned to that corner, and she put her hand over them as a\nshade, while she looked into it.  Again they went all round the room,\nscarcely heeding Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.  He\nthought, as she once more shaded them   not so much looking at him, as\nlooking for him with a brutish instinct that he was there   that no single\ntrace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind that went\nalong with them, of the woman he had married eighteen years before.  But\nthat he had seen her come to this by inches, he never could have believed\nher to be the same.\n\nAll this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless and\npowerless, except to watch her.\n\nStupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about nothing, she\nsat for a little while with her hands at her ears, and her head resting\non them.  Presently, she resumed her staring round the room.  And now,\nfor the first time, her eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it.\n\nStraightway she turned her eyes back to his corner, with the defiance of\nlast night, and moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her\ngreedy hand.  She drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while\nconsidering which of the two bottles she should choose.  Finally, she\nlaid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death\nin it, and, before his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.\n\nDream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to stir.  If this be\nreal, and her allotted time be not yet come, wake, Rachael, wake!\n\nShe thought of that, too.  She looked at Rachael, and very slowly, very\ncautiously, poured out the contents.  The draught was at her lips.  A\nmoment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come\nabout her with its utmost power.  But in that moment Rachael started up\nwith a suppressed cry.  The creature struggled, struck her, seized her by\nthe hair; but Rachael had the cup.\n\nStephen broke out of his chair.  \"Rachael, am I wakin' or dreamin' this\ndreadfo' night?\"\n\n\"'Tis all well, Stephen.  I have been asleep, myself.  'Tis near three.\nHush!  I hear the bells.\"\n\nThe wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.  They\nlistened, and it struck three.  Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she\nwas, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her\nforehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been\nawake.  She held the cup in her hand even now.\n\n\"I thought it must be near three,\" she said, calmly pouring from the cup\ninto the basin, and steeping the linen as before.  \"I am thankful I\nstayed!  'Tis done now, when I have put this on.  There!  And now she's\nquiet again.  The few drops in the basin I'll pour away, for 'tis bad\nstuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.\"  As she spoke, she\ndrained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the\nhearth.\n\nShe had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her shawl before\ngoing out into the wind and rain.\n\n\"Thou'lt let me walk wi' thee at this hour, Rachael?\"\n\n\"No, Stephen.  'Tis but a minute, and I'm home.\"\n\n\"Thou'rt not fearfo';\" he said it in a low voice, as they went out at the\ndoor; \"to leave me alone wi' her!\"\n\nAs she looked at him, saying, \"Stephen?\" he went down on his knee before\nher, on the poor mean stairs, and put an end of her shawl to his lips.\n\n\"Thou art an Angel.  Bless thee, bless thee!\"\n\n\"I am, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor friend.  Angels are not\nlike me.  Between them, and a working woman fu' of faults, there is a\ndeep gulf set.  My little sister is among them, but she is changed.\"\n\nShe raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words; and then they\nfell again, in all their gentleness and mildness, on his face.\n\n\"Thou changest me from bad to good.  Thou mak'st me humbly wishfo' to be\nmore like thee, and fearfo' to lose thee when this life is ower, and a'\nthe muddle cleared awa'.  Thou'rt an Angel; it may be, thou hast saved my\nsoul alive!\"\n\nShe looked at him, on his knee at her feet, with her shawl still in his\nhand, and the reproof on her lips died away when she saw the working of\nhis face.\n\n\"I coom home desp'rate.  I coom home wi'out a hope, and mad wi' thinking\nthat when I said a word o' complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand.\nI told thee I had had a fright.  It were the Poison-bottle on table.  I\nnever hurt a livin' creetur; but happenin' so suddenly upon 't, I thowt,\n\"How can _I_ say what I might ha' done to myseln, or her, or both!\"\"\n\nShe put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of terror, to stop him\nfrom saying more.  He caught them in his unoccupied hand, and holding\nthem, and still clasping the border of her shawl, said hurriedly:\n\n\"But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed.  I ha' seen thee, aw this\nnight.  In my troublous sleep I ha' known thee still to be there.\nEvermore I will see thee there.  I nevermore will see her or think o'\nher, but thou shalt be beside her.  I nevermore will see or think o'\nanything that angers me, but thou, so much better than me, shalt be by\nth' side on't.  And so I will try t' look t' th' time, and so I will try\nt' trust t' th' time, when thou and me at last shall walk together far\nawa', beyond the deep gulf, in th' country where thy little sister is.\"\n\nHe kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her go.  She bade him\ngood night in a broken voice, and went out into the street.\n\nThe wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear, and still\nblew strongly.  It had cleared the sky before it, and the rain had spent\nitself or travelled elsewhere, and the stars were bright.  He stood\nbare-headed in the road, watching her quick disappearance.  As the\nshining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was Rachael, in\nthe rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his life.\n\n\n\n",

You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs.\nM'Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I\nlooked for.  You are extremely deficient in your facts.  Your\nacquaintance with figures is very limited.  You are altogether backward,\nand below the mark.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, sir,\" she returned; \"but I know it is quite true.  Yet I\nhave tried hard, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have\nobserved you, and I can find no fault in that respect.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.  I have thought sometimes;\" Sissy very timid here; \"that\nperhaps I tried to learn too much, and that if I had asked to be allowed\nto try a little less, I might have   \"\n\n\"No, Jupe, no,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his head in his profoundest\nand most eminently practical way.  \"No.  The course you pursued, you\npursued according to the system   the system   and there is no more to be\nsaid about it.  I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early\nlife were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers,\nand that we began too late.  Still, as I have said already, I am\ndisappointed.\"\n\n\"I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness\nto a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection\nof her.\"\n\n\"Don't shed tears,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Don't shed tears.  I don't\ncomplain of you.  You are an affectionate, earnest, good young\nwoman   and   and we must make that do.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, very much,\" said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey.\n\n\"You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you\nare serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa,\nand, indeed, so I have observed myself.  I therefore hope,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind, \"that you can make yourself happy in those relations.\"\n\n\"I should have nothing to wish, sir, if   \"\n\n\"I understand you,\" said Mr. Gradgrind; \"you still refer to your father.\nI have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle.  Well!\nIf your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been\nmore successful, you would have been wiser on these points.  I will say\nno more.\"\n\nHe really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he\nheld her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must\nhave fallen upon that conclusion.  Somehow or other, he had become\npossessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could\nhardly be set forth in a tabular form.  Her capacity of definition might\nbe easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at\nnothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for example,\nto tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would have\nquite known how to divide her.\n\nIn some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of\nTime are very rapid.  Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage\nof their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while\nMr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no\nalteration.\n\nExcept one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill.\nTime hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a\nby-comer, and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the\nrespected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the\nrepresentatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable\ngentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame\nhonourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other\nconsideration.  Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen\nhundred and odd years after our Master?\n\nAll this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so\nmuch given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the\ngrate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said\nshe was almost a young woman   which seemed but yesterday   she had scarcely\nattracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman.\n\n\"Quite a young woman,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, musing.  \"Dear me!\"\n\nSoon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for\nseveral days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.  On a certain\nnight, when he was going out, and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before\nhis departure   as he was not to be home until late and she would not see\nhim again until the morning   he held her in his arms, looking at her in\nhis kindest manner, and said:\n\n\"My dear Louisa, you are a woman!\"\n\nShe answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she\nwas found at the Circus; then cast down her eyes.  \"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"I must speak with you alone and\nseriously.  Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Your hands are rather cold, Louisa.  Are you not well?\"\n\n\"Quite well, father.\"\n\n\"And cheerful?\"\n\nShe looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar manner.  \"I am as\ncheerful, father, as I usually am, or usually have been.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  So, he kissed her and went away; and\nLouisa returned to the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character,\nand leaning her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks\nthat so soon subsided into ashes.\n\n\"Are you there, Loo?\" said her brother, looking in at the door.  He was\nquite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing\none.\n\n\"Dear Tom,\" she answered, rising and embracing him, \"how long it is since\nyou have been to see me!\"\n\n\"Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the evenings; and in the\ndaytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather.  But I touch him\nup with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an\nunderstanding.  I say!  Has father said anything particular to you to-day\nor yesterday, Loo?\"\n\n\"No, Tom.  But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Ah!  That's what I mean,\" said Tom.  \"Do you know where he is\nto-night?\"   with a very deep expression.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you.  He's with old Bounderby.  They are having a regular\nconfab together up at the Bank.  Why at the Bank, do you think?  Well,\nI'll tell you again.  To keep Mrs. Sparsit's ears as far off as possible,\nI expect.\"\n\nWith her hand upon her brother's shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at\nthe fire.  Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than\nusual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.\n\n\"You are very fond of me, an't you, Loo?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without\ncoming to see me.\"\n\n\"Well, sister of mine,\" said Tom, \"when you say that, you are near my\nthoughts.  We might be so much oftener together   mightn't we?  Always\ntogether, almost   mightn't we?  It would do me a great deal of good if you\nwere to make up your mind to I know what, Loo.  It would be a splendid\nthing for me.  It would be uncommonly jolly!\"\n\nHer thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny.  He could make nothing\nof her face.  He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek.  She\nreturned the kiss, but still looked at the fire.\n\n\"I say, Loo!  I thought I'd come, and just hint to you what was going on:\nthough I supposed you'd most likely guess, even if you didn't know.  I\ncan't stay, because I'm engaged to some fellows to-night.  You won't\nforget how fond you are of me?\"\n\n\"No, dear Tom, I won't forget.\"\n\n\"That's a capital girl,\" said Tom.  \"Good-bye, Loo.\"\n\nShe gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the\ndoor, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance\nlurid.  She stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening\nto his departing steps.  They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from\nStone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet.\nIt seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the\nfiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time,\nthat greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from\nthe threads he had already spun into a woman.  But his factory is a\nsecret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\n\n\n\n",

Whatever they could prove\n(which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army\nconstantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.  In that charmed\napartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into\nexact totals, and finally settled   if those concerned could only have been\nbrought to know it.  As if an astronomical observatory should be made\nwithout any windows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry\nuniverse solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr. Gradgrind, in _his_\nObservatory (and there are many like it), had no need to cast an eye upon\nthe teeming myriads of human beings around him, but could settle all\ntheir destinies on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty\nlittle bit of sponge.\n\nTo this Observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock\nin it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a\ncoffin-lid; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning.  A window looked\ntowards Coketown; and when she sat down near her father's table, she saw\nthe high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy\ndistance gloomily.\n\n\"My dear Louisa,\" said her father, \"I prepared you last night to give me\nyour serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have\ntogether.  You have been so well trained, and you do, I am happy to say,\nso much justice to the education you have received, that I have perfect\nconfidence in your good sense.  You are not impulsive, you are not\nromantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the strong\ndispassionate ground of reason and calculation.  From that ground alone,\nI know you will view and consider what I am going to communicate.\"\n\nHe waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something.  But\nshe said never a word.\n\n\"Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has\nbeen made to me.\"\n\nAgain he waited, and again she answered not one word.  This so far\nsurprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat, \"a proposal of\nmarriage, my dear.\"  To which she returned, without any visible emotion\nwhatever:\n\n\"I hear you, father.  I am attending, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the\nmoment at a loss, \"you are even more dispassionate than I expected,\nLouisa.  Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have\nit in charge to make?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that, father, until I hear it.  Prepared or unprepared, I\nwish to hear it all from you.  I wish to hear you state it to me,\nfather.\"\n\nStrange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as\nhis daughter was.  He took a paper-knife in his hand, turned it over,\nlaid it down, took it up again, and even then had to look along the blade\nof it, considering how to go on.\n\n\"What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly reasonable.  I have\nundertaken then to let you know that   in short, that Mr. Bounderby has\ninformed me that he has long watched your progress with particular\ninterest and pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ultimately\narrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage.  That time, to\nwhich he has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward,\nis now come.  Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and\nhas entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that\nyou will take it into your favourable consideration.\"\n\nSilence between them.  The deadly statistical clock very hollow.  The\ndistant smoke very black and heavy.\n\n\"Father,\" said Louisa, \"do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question.\n\"Well, my child,\" he returned, \"I   really   cannot take upon myself to say.\"\n\n\"Father,\" pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \"do you ask\nme to love Mr. Bounderby?\"\n\n\"My dear Louisa, no.  No.  I ask nothing.\"\n\n\"Father,\" she still pursued, \"does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\"\n\n\"Really, my dear,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"it is difficult to answer your\nquestion   \"\n\n\"Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear.  Because;\" here was something to demonstrate, and it\nset him up again; \"because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on\nthe sense in which we use the expression.  Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do\nyou the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending\nto anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms)\nsentimental.  Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes,\nto very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your\ngood sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground.\nTherefore, perhaps the expression itself   I merely suggest this to you, my\ndear   may be a little misplaced.\"\n\n\"What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear Louisa,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this\ntime, \"I would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question,\nas you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as\none of tangible Fact.  The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such\nsubjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no\nexistence, properly viewed   really no existence   but it is no compliment to\nyou to say, that you know better.  Now, what are the Facts of this case?\nYou are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby\nis, we will say in round numbers, fifty.  There is some disparity in your\nrespective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the\ncontrary, there is a great suitability.  Then the question arises, Is\nthis one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage?  In\nconsidering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the\nstatistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England\nand Wales.  I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion\nof these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages,\nand that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than\nthree-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom.  It is remarkable as\nshowing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the\nBritish possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and\namong the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet\nfurnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  The disparity I have\nmentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all\nbut disappears.\"\n\n\"What do you recommend, father,\" asked Louisa, her reserved composure not\nin the least affected by these gratifying results, \"that I should\nsubstitute for the term I used just now?  For the misplaced expression?\"\n\n\"Louisa,\" returned her father, \"it appears to me that nothing can be\nplainer.  Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you\nstate to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him?  Yes, he\ndoes.  The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?  I think\nnothing can be plainer than that?\"\n\n\"Shall I marry him?\" repeated Louisa, with great deliberation.\n\n\"Precisely.  And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear\nLouisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that\nquestion with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that\nbelong to many young women.\"\n\n\"No, father,\" she returned, \"I do not.\"\n\n\"I now leave you to judge for yourself,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"I have\nstated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds;\nI have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its\ntime.  The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.  As he now leaned\nback in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn,\nperhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was\nimpelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up\nconfidences of her heart.  But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a\nbound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting,\nbetween himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will\nelude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be\nsounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.  The barriers were too many and\ntoo high for such a leap.  With his unbending, utilitarian,\nmatter-of-fact face, he hardened her again; and the moment shot away into\nthe plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost\nopportunities that are drowned there.\n\nRemoving her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the\ntown, that he said, at length: \"Are you consulting the chimneys of the\nCoketown works, Louisa?\"\n\n\"There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.  Yet\nwhen the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!\" she answered, turning\nquickly.\n\n\"Of course I know that, Louisa.  I do not see the application of the\nremark.\"  To do him justice he did not, at all.\n\nShe passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and concentrating\nher attention upon him again, said, \"Father, I have often thought that\nlife is very short.\"   This was so distinctly one of his subjects that he\ninterposed.\n\n\"It is short, no doubt, my dear.  Still, the average duration of human\nlife is proved to have increased of late years.  The calculations of\nvarious life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which\ncannot go wrong, have established the fact.\"\n\n\"I speak of my own life, father.\"\n\n\"O indeed?  Still,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"I need not point out to you,\nLouisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the\naggregate.\"\n\n\"While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am\nfit for.  What does it matter?\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words;\nreplying, \"How, matter?  What matter, my dear?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby,\" she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding\nthis, \"asks me to marry him.  The question I have to ask myself is, shall\nI marry him?  That is so, father, is it not?  You have told me so,\nfather.  Have you not?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear.\"\n\n\"Let it be so.  Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied\nto accept his proposal.  Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that\nthis was my answer.  Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I\nshould wish him to know what I said.\"\n\n\"It is quite right, my dear,\" retorted her father approvingly, \"to be\nexact.  I will observe your very proper request.  Have you any wish in\nreference to the period of your marriage, my child?\"\n\n\"None, father.  What does it matter!\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her\nhand.  But, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some\nlittle discord on his ear.  He paused to look at her, and, still holding\nher hand, said:\n\n\"Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question,\nbecause the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.\nBut perhaps I ought to do so.  You have never entertained in secret any\nother proposal?\"\n\n\"Father,\" she returned, almost scornfully, \"what other proposal can have\nbeen made to _me_?  Whom have I seen?  Where have I been?  What are my\nheart's experiences?\"\n\n\"My dear Louisa,\" returned Mr. Gradgrind, reassured and satisfied.  \"You\ncorrect me justly.  I merely wished to discharge my duty.\"\n\n\"What do _I_ know, father,\" said Louisa in her quiet manner, \"of tastes\nand fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature\nin which such light things might have been nourished?  What escape have I\nhad from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be\ngrasped?\"  As she said it, she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon\na solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or\nash.\n\n\"My dear,\" assented her eminently practical parent, \"quite true, quite\ntrue.\"\n\n\"Why, father,\" she pursued, \"what a strange question to ask _me_!  The\nbaby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children, has\nnever had its innocent resting-place in my breast.  You have been so\ncareful of me, that I never had a child's heart.  You have trained me so\nwell, that I never dreamed a child's dream.  You have dealt so wisely\nwith me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child's\nbelief or a child's fear.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this testimony to\nit.  \"My dear Louisa,\" said he, \"you abundantly repay my care.  Kiss me,\nmy dear girl.\"\n\nSo, his daughter kissed him.  Detaining her in his embrace, he said, \"I\nmay assure you now, my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound\ndecision at which you have arrived.  Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable\nman; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you   if any   is\nmore than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.  It has\nalways been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still\nin your early youth, be (if I may so express myself) almost any age.\nKiss me once more, Louisa.  Now, let us go and find your mother.\"\n\nAccordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady\nwith no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked\nbeside her.  She gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they\nentered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting\nattitude.\n\n\"Mrs. Gradgrind,\" said her husband, who had waited for the achievement of\nthis feat with some impatience, \"allow me to present to you Mrs.\nBounderby.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, \"so you have settled it!  Well, I'm sure I\nhope your health may be good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as\nsoon as you are married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider\nthat you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as\nall girls do.  However, I give you joy, my dear   and I hope you may now\nturn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do!  I must\ngive you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don't touch my right\nshoulder, for there's something running down it all day long.  And now\nyou see,\" whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her shawls after the\naffectionate ceremony, \"I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and\nnight, to know what I am to call him!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Gradgrind,\" said her husband, solemnly, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is married to Louisa!\nI must call him something.  It's impossible,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a\nmingled sense of politeness and injury, \"to be constantly addressing him\nand never giving him a name.  I cannot call him Josiah, for the name is\ninsupportable to me.  You yourself wouldn't hear of Joe, you very well\nknow.  Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister!  Not, I believe, unless\nthe time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my\nrelations.  Then, what am I to call him!\"\n\nNobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable\nemergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after\ndelivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed:\n\n\"As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is,   and I ask it with a fluttering\nin my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet,   that it may\ntake place soon.  Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall\nnever hear the last of.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly\nturned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in\na multitude of emotions, towards Louisa.  Louisa had known it, and seen\nit, without looking at her.  From that moment she was impassive, proud\nand cold   held Sissy at a distance   changed to her altogether.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XVI\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\n\n\nMR. BOUNDERBY'S first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was\noccasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.  He could\nnot make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step\nmight be.  Whether she would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to Lady\nScadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether\nshe would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would\nbreak her heart, or break the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all\nforesee.  However, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so,\nafter attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he resolved to\ndo it by word of mouth.\n\nOn his way home, on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose,\nhe took the precaution of stepping into a chemist's shop and buying a\nbottle of the very strongest smelling-salts.  \"By George!\" said Mr.\nBounderby, \"if she takes it in the fainting way, I'll have the skin off\nher nose, at all events!\"  But, in spite of being thus forearmed, he\nentered his own house with anything but a courageous air; and appeared\nbefore the object of his misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of\ncoming direct from the pantry.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!\"\n\n\"Good evening, ma'am, good evening.\"  He drew up his chair, and Mrs.\nSparsit drew back hers, as who should say, \"Your fireside, sir.  I freely\nadmit it.  It is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.\"\n\n\"Don't go to the North Pole, ma'am!\" said Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her\nformer position.\n\nMr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a stiff, sharp\npair of scissors, she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental\npurpose, in a piece of cambric.  An operation which, taken in connexion\nwith the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with some\nliveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little\nbird.  She was so steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before\nshe looked up from her work; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her\nattention with a hitch of his head.\n\n\"Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,\" said Mr. Bounderby, putting his hands in his\npockets, and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the\nlittle bottle was ready for use, \"I have no occasion to say to you, that\nyou are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned the lady, \"this is indeed not the first time that you\nhave honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"I am going to astonish you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most\ntranquil manner possible.  She generally wore mittens, and she now laid\ndown her work, and smoothed those mittens.\n\n\"I am going, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"to marry Tom Gradgrind's daughter.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \"I hope you may be happy, Mr.\nBounderby.  Oh, indeed I hope you may be happy, sir!\"  And she said it\nwith such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for\nhim, that Bounderby,   far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her\nworkbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,   corked up the\nsmelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought, \"Now confound this\nwoman, who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way!\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, in a highly superior\nmanner; somehow she seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to\npity him ever afterwards; \"that you may be in all respects very happy.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" returned Bounderby, with some resentment in his tone:\nwhich was clearly lowered, though in spite of himself, \"I am obliged to\nyou.  I hope I shall be.\"\n\n\"_Do_ you, sir!\" said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability.  \"But\nnaturally you do; of course you do.\"\n\nA very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby's part, succeeded.  Mrs. Sparsit\nsedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which\nsounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance.\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" resumed Bounderby, \"under these circumstances, I imagine\nit would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here,\nthough you would be very welcome here.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!\" Mrs. Sparsit\nshook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed\nthe small cough   coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within\nher, but had better be coughed down.\n\n\"However, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"there are apartments at the Bank,\nwhere a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a\ncatch than otherwise; and if the same terms   \"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir.  You were so good as to promise that you would\nalways substitute the phrase, annual compliment.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, annual compliment.  If the same annual compliment would be\nacceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \"The proposal is like yourself, and if the\nposition I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without\ndescending lower in the social scale   \"\n\n\"Why, of course it is,\" said Bounderby.  \"If it was not, ma'am, you don't\nsuppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you\nhave moved in.  Not that _I_ care for such society, you know!  But _you_\ndo.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.\"\n\n\"You'll have your own private apartments, and you'll have your coals and\nyour candles, and all the rest of it, and you'll have your maid to attend\nupon you, and you'll have your light porter to protect you, and you'll be\nwhat I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,\" said\nBounderby.\n\n\"Sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \"say no more.  In yielding up my trust\nhere, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of\ndependence:\" she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate\narticle in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: \"and I would\nrather receive it from your hand, than from any other.  Therefore, sir, I\naccept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for\npast favours.  And I hope, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an\nimpressively compassionate manner, \"I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind may\nbe all you desire, and deserve!\"\n\nNothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.  It was in vain\nfor Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive\nways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him, as a Victim.\nShe was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the\nmore obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary\naltogether, she; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he.  She had that\ntenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used\nto break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him.\n\nMeanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks'\ntime, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted\nwooer.  Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets; and,\non all occasions during the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing\naspect.  Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were\nmade, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts did\nappropriate honour to the contract.  The business was all Fact, from\nfirst to last.  The Hours did not go through any of those rosy\nperformances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times;\nneither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other\nseasons.  The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory\nknocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his\naccustomed regularity.\n\nSo the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to\nreason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid\nwooden legs   that popular order of architecture   Josiah Bounderby Esquire\nof Coketown, to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of\nStone Lodge, M.P. for that borough.  And when they were united in holy\nmatrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid.\n\nThere was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who\nknew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it\nwas imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,\nwhether native or foreign, and all about it.  The bridesmaids, down to\nlittle Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit\nhelpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of\nthe company.\n\nAfter breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  Since you have\ndone my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness,\nI suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and\nknow what I am, and what my extraction was, you won't expect a speech\nfrom a man who, when he sees a Post, says \"that's a Post,\" and when he\nsees a Pump, says \"that's a Pump,\" and is not to be got to call a Post a\nPump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.  If you want a\nspeech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a\nMember of Parliament, and you know where to get it.  I am not your man.\nHowever, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table\nto-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind's\ndaughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless\nit was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I\nmay be excused.  So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you\ndon't, I can't help it.  I _do_ feel independent.  Now I have mentioned,\nand you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind's\ndaughter.  I am very glad to be so.  It has long been my wish to be so.\nI have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.  At\nthe same time   not to deceive you   I believe I am worthy of her.  So, I\nthank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards\nus; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present\ncompany, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have\nfound.  And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife\nhas found.\"\n\nShortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial trip to\nLyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing\nhow the Hands got on in those parts, and whether they, too, required to\nbe fed with gold spoons; the happy pair departed for the railroad.  The\nbride, in passing down-stairs, dressed for her journey, found Tom waiting\nfor her   flushed, either with his feelings, or the vinous part of the\nbreakfast.\n\n\"What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!\"\nwhispered Tom.\n\nShe clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that\nday, and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first\ntime.\n\n\"Old Bounderby's quite ready,\" said Tom.  \"Time's up.  Good-bye!  I shall\nbe on the look-out for you, when you come back.  I say, my dear Loo!\nAN'T it uncommonly jolly now!\"\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                          END OF THE FIRST BOOK\n\n_REAPING_\n\n\n",

However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind's daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.  So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don't, I can't help it.  I _do_ feel independent.  Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind's daughter.  I am very glad to be so.  It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me.  At the same time   not to deceive you   I believe I am worthy of her.  So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found.  And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found."

        "raw text": " I\nEFFECTS IN THE BANK\n\n\nA SUNNY midsummer day.  There was such a thing sometimes, even in\nCoketown.\n\nSeen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of\nits own, which appeared impervious to the sun's rays.  You only knew the\ntown was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky\nblotch upon the prospect without a town.  A blur of soot and smoke, now\nconfusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of\nHeaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell,\nor changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross\nlight in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:   Coketown in the\ndistance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be\nseen.\n\nThe wonder was, it was there at all.  It had been ruined so often, that\nit was amazing how it had borne so many shocks.  Surely there never was\nsuch fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were\nmade.  Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such\nease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.  They were\nruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school;\nthey were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works;\nthey were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether\nthey were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery;\nthey were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not\nalways make quite so much smoke.  Besides Mr. Bounderby's gold spoon\nwhich was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was\nvery popular there.  It took the form of a threat.  Whenever a Coketowner\nfelt he was ill-used   that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely\nalone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences\nof any of his acts   he was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he\nwould \"sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic.\"  This had terrified\nthe Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions.\n\nHowever, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had\npitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had\nbeen kind enough to take mighty good care of it.  So there it was, in the\nhaze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.\n\nThe streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so\nbright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over\nCoketown, and could not be looked at steadily.  Stokers emerged from low\nunderground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and\npalings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.  The\nwhole town seemed to be frying in oil.  There was a stifling smell of hot\noil everywhere.  The steam-engines shone with it, the dresses of the\nHands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed\nand trickled it.  The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the\nbreath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled\nlanguidly in the desert.  But no temperature made the melancholy mad\nelephants more mad or more sane.  Their wearisome heads went up and down\nat the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair\nweather and foul.  The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was\nthe substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods;\nwhile, for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year round,\nfrom the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and\nwheels.\n\nDrowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger\nmore sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.\nSun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets\nand the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a\nfierce heat.  Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some\nCoketown boys who were at large   a rare sight there   rowed a crazy boat,\nwhich made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every\ndip of an oar stirred up vile smells.  But the sun itself, however\nbeneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and\nrarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering\nmore death than life.  So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil\neye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the\nthings it looks upon to bless.\n\nMrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier\nside of the frying street.  Office-hours were over: and at that period of\nthe day, in warm weather, she usually embellished with her genteel\npresence, a managerial board-room over the public office.  Her own\nprivate sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of\nobservation she was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he\ncame across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a\nVictim.  He had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never\nreleased him from her determined pity a moment.\n\nThe Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.  It\nwas another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside\nblinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and\na brazen door-handle full stop.  It was a size larger than Mr.\nBounderby's house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes\nsmaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.\n\nMrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the\ndesks and writing implements, she shed a feminine, not to say also\naristocratic, grace upon the office.  Seated, with her needlework or\nnetting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of\ncorrecting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the\nplace.  With this impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs.\nSparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy.  The\ntownspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded\nher as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.\n\nWhat those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did.  Gold\nand silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring\nvague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she\ndisliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof.  For the\nrest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the\noffice furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks,\nagainst the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head\nevery night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow.  Further,\nshe was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply\nspiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the\nrelics of the current day's work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out\npens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that\nnothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit\ntried.  Lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and\ncarbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official\nchimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated\nfrom a place of business claiming to be wealthy   a row of\nfire-buckets   vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any\noccasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal\nto bullion, on most beholders.\n\nA deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit's\nempire.  The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying\nhad for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that she\nwould be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her\nmoney.  It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some\ntime, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and\nher situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much\noffence and disappointment.\n\nMrs. Sparsit's tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its\ntripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours,\ninto the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that\nbestrode the middle of the room.  The light porter placed the tea-tray on\nit, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage.\n\n\"Thank you, Bitzer,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Thank _you_, ma'am,\" returned the light porter.  He was a very light\nporter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a\nhorse, for girl number twenty.\n\n\"All is shut up, Bitzer?\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"All is shut up, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And what,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, \"is the news of the\nday?  Anything?\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, I can't say that I have heard anything particular.  Our\npeople are a bad lot, ma'am; but that is no news, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"What are the restless wretches doing now?\" asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Merely going on in the old way, ma'am.  Uniting, and leaguing, and\nengaging to stand by one another.\"\n\n\"It is much to be regretted,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more\nRoman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity,\n\"that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Bitzer.\n\n\"Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces\nagainst employing any man who is united with any other man,\" said Mrs.\nSparsit.\n\n\"They have done that, ma'am,\" returned Bitzer; \"but it rather fell\nthrough, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I do not pretend to understand these things,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, with\ndignity, \"my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere;\nand Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any\nsuch dissensions.  I only know that these people must be conquered, and\nthat it's high time it was done, once for all.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for\nMrs. Sparsit's oracular authority.  \"You couldn't put it clearer, I am\nsure, ma'am.\"\n\nAs this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with\nMrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was\ngoing to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers,\ninkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing\nthrough the open window, down into the street.\n\n\"Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\" asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Not a very busy day, my lady.  About an average day.\"  He now and then\nslided into my lady, instead of ma'am, as an involuntary acknowledgment\nof Mrs. Sparsit's personal dignity and claims to reverence.\n\n\"The clerks,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible\ncrumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, \"are trustworthy,\npunctual, and industrious, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, pretty fair, ma'am.  With the usual exception.\"\n\nHe held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the\nestablishment, for which volunteer service he received a present at\nChristmas, over and above his weekly wage.  He had grown into an\nextremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise\nin the world.  His mind was so exactly regulated, that he had no\naffections or passions.  All his proceedings were the result of the\nnicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs.\nSparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the\nsteadiest principle she had ever known.  Having satisfied himself, on his\nfather's death, that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown,\nthis excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such\na steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she had been\nshut up in the workhouse ever since.  It must be admitted that he allowed\nher half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him: first, because all\ngifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient, and\nsecondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would\nhave been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it\nfor as much as he could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained\nby philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man   not a\npart of man's duty, but the whole.\n\n\"Pretty fair, ma'am.  With the usual exception, ma'am,\" repeated Bitzer.\n\n\"Ah   h!\" said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking\na long gulp.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas, ma'am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma'am, I don't like his\nways at all.\"\n\n\"Bitzer,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, \"do you\nrecollect my having said anything to you respecting names?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am.  It's quite true that you did object to names\nbeing used, and they're always best avoided.\"\n\n\"Please to remember that I have a charge here,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, with\nher air of state.  \"I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby.\nHowever improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it\nyears ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual\ncompliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.  From Mr. Bounderby I\nhave received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every\nrecognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.  More,\nfar more.  Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true.  And I do\nnot consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,\" said Mrs. Sparsit,\nwith a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, \"that I\n_should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under\nthis roof, that are unfortunately   most unfortunately   no doubt of\nthat   connected with his.\"\n\nBitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon.\n\n\"No, Bitzer,\" continued Mrs. Sparsit, \"say an individual, and I will hear\nyou; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.\"\n\n\"With the usual exception, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, trying back, \"of an\nindividual.\"\n\n\"Ah   h!\"  Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head\nover her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again\nat the point where it had been interrupted.\n\n\"An individual, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, \"has never been what he ought to\nhave been, since he first came into the place.  He is a dissipated,\nextravagant idler.  He is not worth his salt, ma'am.  He wouldn't get it\neither, if he hadn't a friend and relation at court, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Ah   h!\" said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head.\n\n\"I only hope, ma'am,\" pursued Bitzer, \"that his friend and relation may\nnot supply him with the means of carrying on.  Otherwise, ma'am, we know\nout of whose pocket _that_ money comes.\"\n\n\"Ah   h!\" sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her\nhead.\n\n\"He is to be pitied, ma'am.  The last party I have alluded to, is to be\npitied, ma'am,\" said Bitzer.\n\n\"Yes, Bitzer,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"I have always pitied the delusion,\nalways.\"\n\n\"As to an individual, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing\nnearer, \"he is as improvident as any of the people in this town.  And you\nknow what _their_ improvidence is, ma'am.  No one could wish to know it\nbetter than a lady of your eminence does.\"\n\n\"They would do well,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"to take example by you,\nBitzer.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.  But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma'am.\nI have put by a little, ma'am, already.  That gratuity which I receive at\nChristmas, ma'am: I never touch it.  I don't even go the length of my\nwages, though they're not high, ma'am.  Why can't they do as I have done,\nma'am?  What one person can do, another can do.\"\n\nThis, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.  Any capitalist there,\nwho had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to\nwonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn't each make sixty\nthousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every\none for not accomplishing the little feat.  What I did you can do.  Why\ndon't you go and do it?\n\n\"As to their wanting recreations, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, \"it's stuff and\nnonsense.  _I_ don't want recreations.  I never did, and I never shall; I\ndon't like 'em.  As to their combining together; there are many of them,\nI have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could\nearn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve\ntheir livelihood.  Then, why don't they improve it, ma'am!  It's the\nfirst consideration of a rational creature, and it's what they pretend to\nwant.\"\n\n\"Pretend indeed!\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma'am, till it becomes quite\nnauseous, concerning their wives and families,\" said Bitzer.  \"Why look\nat me, ma'am!  I don't want a wife and family.  Why should they?\"\n\n\"Because they are improvident,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" returned Bitzer, \"that's where it is.  If they were more\nprovident and less perverse, ma'am, what would they do?  They would say,\n\"While my hat covers my family,\" or \"while my bonnet covers my\nfamily,\"   as the case might be, ma'am   \"I have only one to feed, and that's\nthe person I most like to feed.\"\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return\nfor the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's improving conversation.  \"Would you wish\na little more hot water, ma'am, or is there anything else that I could\nfetch you?\"\n\n\"Nothing just now, Bitzer.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.  I shouldn't wish to disturb you at your meals, ma'am,\nparticularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,\" said Bitzer, craning a\nlittle to look over into the street from where he stood; \"but there's a\ngentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma'am, and he has come\nacross as if he was going to knock.  That _is_ his knock, ma'am, no\ndoubt.\"\n\nHe stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again,\nconfirmed himself with, \"Yes, ma'am.  Would you wish the gentleman to be\nshown in, ma'am?\"\n\n\"I don't know who it can be,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and\narranging her mittens.\n\n\"A stranger, ma'am, evidently.\"\n\n\"What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless\nhe comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don't know,\" said\nMrs. Sparsit, \"but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.\nBounderby, and I will never shrink from it.  If to see him is any part of\nthe duty I have accepted, I will see him.  Use your own discretion,\nBitzer.\"\n\nHere the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit's magnanimous words,\nrepeated his knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open\nthe door; while Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her little\ntable, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped\nup-stairs, that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.\n\n\"If you please, ma'am, the gentleman would wish to see you,\" said Bitzer,\nwith his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit's keyhole.  So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had\nimproved the interval by touching up her cap, took her classical features\ndown-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner of a Roman\nmatron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.\n\nThe visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in\nlooking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man\ncould possibly be.  He stood whistling to himself with all imaginable\ncoolness, with his hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustion upon\nhim, in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive\ngentility.  For it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough\ngentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of everything, and\nputting no more faith in anything than Lucifer.\n\n\"I believe, sir,\" quoth Mrs. Sparsit, \"you wished to see me.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, turning and removing his hat; \"pray excuse\nme.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a stately bend.  \"Five and\nthirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding,\nwell-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.\"  All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in\nher womanly way   like the Sultan who put his head in the pail of\nwater   merely in dipping down and coming up again.\n\n\"Please to be seated, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Thank you.  Allow me.\"  He placed a chair for her, but remained himself\ncarelessly lounging against the table.  \"I left my servant at the railway\nlooking after the luggage   very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the\nvan   and strolled on, looking about me.  Exceedingly odd place.  Will you\nallow me to ask you if it's _always_ as black as this?\"\n\n\"In general much blacker,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her uncompromising\nway.\n\n\"Is it possible!  Excuse me: you are not a native, I think?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \"It was once my good or ill fortune,\nas it may be   before I became a widow   to move in a very different sphere.\nMy husband was a Powler.\"\n\n\"Beg your pardon, really!\" said the stranger.  \"Was   ?\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit repeated, \"A Powler.\"\n\n\"Powler Family,\" said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments.  Mrs.\nSparsit signified assent.  The stranger seemed a little more fatigued\nthan before.\n\n\"You must be very much bored here?\" was the inference he drew from the\ncommunication.\n\n\"I am the servant of circumstances, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"and I have\nlong adapted myself to the governing power of my life.\"\n\n\"Very philosophical,\" returned the stranger, \"and very exemplary and\nlaudable, and   \"  It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the\nsentence, so he played with his watch-chain wearily.\n\n\"May I be permitted to ask, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"to what I am\nindebted for the favour of   \"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said the stranger.  \"Much obliged to you for reminding me.\nI am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.\nWalking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were getting\ndinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met; one of the\nworking people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of\nsomething fluffy, which I assume to be the raw material   \"\n\nMrs. Sparsit inclined her head.\n\n\"   Raw material   where Mr. Bounderby, the banker, might reside.  Upon\nwhich, misled no doubt by the word Banker, he directed me to the Bank.\nFact being, I presume, that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does _not_ reside in\nthe edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"he does not.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present\nmoment, nor have I. But strolling on to the Bank to kill time, and having\nthe good fortune to observe at the window,\" towards which he languidly\nwaved his hand, then slightly bowed, \"a lady of a very superior and\nagreeable appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take\nthe liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker _does_\nlive.  Which I accordingly venture, with all suitable apologies, to do.\"\n\nThe inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved,\nto Mrs. Sparsit's thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered\nher homage too.  Here he was, for instance, at this moment, all but\nsitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her, as if he\nacknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming   in her way.\n\n\"Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,\" said the\nstranger, whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant\nlikewise; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever\ncontained   which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this\nnumerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: \"therefore I may\nobserve that my letter   here it is   is from the member for this\nplace   Gradgrind   whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London.\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was\nquite unnecessary, and gave Mr. Bounderby's address, with all needful\nclues and directions in aid.\n\n\"Thousand thanks,\" said the stranger.  \"Of course you know the Banker\nwell?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.  \"In my dependent relation towards\nhim, I have known him ten years.\"\n\n\"Quite an eternity!  I think he married Gradgrind's daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, \"he had\nthat   honour.\"\n\n\"The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"_Is_ she?\"\n\n\"Excuse my impertinent curiosity,\" pursued the stranger, fluttering over\nMrs. Sparsit's eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, \"but you know the\nfamily, and know the world.  I am about to know the family, and may have\nmuch to do with them.  Is the lady so very alarming?  Her father gives\nher such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning\ndesire to know.  Is she absolutely unapproachable?  Repellently and\nstunningly clever?  I see, by your meaning smile, you think not.  You\nhave poured balm into my anxious soul.  As to age, now.  Forty?  Five and\nthirty?\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit laughed outright.  \"A chit,\" said she.  \"Not twenty when she\nwas married.\"\n\n\"I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,\" returned the stranger, detaching\nhimself from the table, \"that I never was so astonished in my life!\"\n\nIt really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity\nof being impressed.  He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a\nminute, and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time.  \"I\nassure you, Mrs. Powler,\" he then said, much exhausted, \"that the\nfather's manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.  I am obliged\nto you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake.  Pray excuse\nmy intrusion.  Many thanks.  Good day!\"\n\nHe bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw\nhim languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of\nall the town.\n\n\"What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?\" she asked the light porter,\nwhen he came to take away.\n\n\"Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma'am.\"\n\n\"It must be admitted,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"that it's very tasteful.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" returned Bitzer, \"if that's worth the money.\"\n\n\"Besides which, ma'am,\" resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table,\n\"he looks to me as if he gamed.\"\n\n\"It's immoral to game,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"It's ridiculous, ma'am,\" said Bitzer, \"because the chances are against\nthe players.\"\n\nWhether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or\nwhether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night.  She\nsat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat\nthere, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it,\nwhen darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward,\nupward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of\nthe factory chimneys, up to the sky.  Without a candle in the room, Mrs.\nSparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much\nof the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the\nrumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street\ncries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by,\nthe shutting-up of shop-shutters.  Not until the light porter announced\nthat her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself\nfrom her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows   by that time\ncreased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs.\n\n\"O, you Fool!\" said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper.  Whom\nshe meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the\nsweetbread.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " II\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE\n\n\nTHE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the\nGraces.  They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits\nmore hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out\neverything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?\n\nMoreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were\nattractive to many of the Gradgrind school.  They liked fine gentlemen;\nthey pretended that they did not, but they did.  They became exhausted in\nimitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they\nserved out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political\neconomy, on which they regaled their disciples.  There never before was\nseen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced.\n\nAmong the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school,\nthere was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn\nof humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the\noccasion of his entertaining it with his (and the Board of Directors)\nview of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever\nknown, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by\nthe finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on\nthe best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded\nthirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole\nsystem would have been positively incomplete.  Among the slain was a cow,\nand among the scattered articles unowned, a widow's cap.  And the\nhonourable member had so tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of\nhumour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any\nserious reference to the Coroner's Inquest, and brought the railway off\nwith Cheers and Laughter.\n\nNow, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than\nhimself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore;\nand had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad,\nand found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored\nthere; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored\neverywhere.  To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said\none day, \"Jem, there's a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and\nthey want men.  I wonder you don't go in for statistics.\"  Jem, rather\ntaken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as\nready to \"go in\" for statistics as for anything else.  So, he went in.\nHe coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it\nabout among the hard Fact fellows, and said, \"If you want to bring in,\nfor any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,\nlook after my brother Jem, for he's your man.\"  After a few dashes in the\npublic meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages\napproved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to\nbecome known there and in the neighbourhood.  Hence the letter Jem had\nlast night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his\nhand; superscribed, \"Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.\nSpecially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire.  Thomas Gradgrind.\"\n\nWithin an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse's\ncard, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel.  There he\nfound Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so\ndisconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \"go in\" for something\nelse.\n\n\"My name, sir,\" said his visitor, \"is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\"\n\nMr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so)\nto have a pleasure he had long expected.\n\n\"Coketown, sir,\" said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \"is not the\nkind of place you have been accustomed to.  Therefore, if you will allow\nme   or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man   I'll tell you\nsomething about it before we go any further.\"\n\nMr. Harthouse would be charmed.\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that,\" said Bounderby.  \"I don't promise it.  First\nof all, you see our smoke.  That's meat and drink to us.  It's the\nhealthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the\nlungs.  If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from\nyou.  We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster\nthan we wear 'em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great\nBritain and Ireland.\"\n\nBy way of \"going in\" to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \"Mr.\nBounderby, I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of\nthinking.  On conviction.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said Bounderby.  \"Now, you have heard a lot of\ntalk about the work in our mills, no doubt.  You have?  Very good.  I'll\nstate the fact of it to you.  It's the pleasantest work there is, and\nit's the lightest work there is, and it's the best-paid work there is.\nMore than that, we couldn't improve the mills themselves, unless we laid\ndown Turkey carpets on the floors.  Which we're not a-going to do.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.\"\n\n\"Lastly,\" said Bounderby, \"as to our Hands.  There's not a Hand in this\ntown, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life.\nThat object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.\nNow, they're not a-going   none of 'em   ever to be fed on turtle soup and\nvenison with a gold spoon.  And now you know the place.\"\n\nMr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and\nrefreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question.\n\n\"Why, you see,\" replied Mr. Bounderby, \"it suits my disposition to have a\nfull understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I\nmake his acquaintance.  I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr.\nHarthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall\nrespond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind's\nletter of introduction.  You are a man of family.  Don't you deceive\nyourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.  I am a bit\nof dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.\"\n\nIf anything could have exalted Jem's interest in Mr. Bounderby, it would\nhave been this very circumstance.  Or, so he told him.\n\n\"So now,\" said Bounderby, \"we may shake hands on equal terms.  I say,\nequal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of\nthe gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as\nproud as you are.  I am just as proud as you are.  Having now asserted my\nindependence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself,\nand I hope you're pretty well.\"\n\nThe better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands, for\nthe salubrious air of Coketown.  Mr. Bounderby received the answer with\nfavour.\n\n\"Perhaps you know,\" said he, \"or perhaps you don't know, I married Tom\nGradgrind's daughter.  If you have nothing better to do than to walk up\ntown with me, I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind's\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby,\" said Jem, \"you anticipate my dearest wishes.\"\n\nThey went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the\nnew acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red\nbrick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds,\nand the black street door up the two white steps.  In the drawing-room of\nwhich mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl\nMr. James Harthouse had ever seen.  She was so constrained, and yet so\ncareless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so\nsensitively ashamed of her husband's braggart humility   from which she\nshrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite\na new sensation to observe her.  In face she was no less remarkable than\nin manner.  Her features were handsome; but their natural play was so\nlocked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine\nexpression.  Utterly indifferent, perfectly self-reliant, never at a\nloss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them\nthere, and her mind apparently quite alone   it was of no use \"going in\"\nyet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all penetration.\n\nFrom the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the house itself.\nThere was no mute sign of a woman in the room.  No graceful little\nadornment, no fanciful little device, however trivial, anywhere expressed\nher influence.  Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich,\nthere the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved\nby the least trace of any womanly occupation.  As Mr. Bounderby stood in\nthe midst of his household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied\ntheir places around Mr. Bounderby, and they were worthy of one another,\nand well matched.\n\n\"This, sir,\" said Bounderby, \"is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind's\neldest daughter.  Loo, Mr. James Harthouse.  Mr. Harthouse has joined\nyour father's muster-roll.  If he is not Tom Gradgrind's colleague before\nlong, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of\nour neighbouring towns.  You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my\njunior.  I don't know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw\nsomething in me, I suppose, or she wouldn't have married me.  She has\nlots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise.  If you want\nto cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better\nadviser than Loo Bounderby.\"\n\nTo a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to\nlearn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended.\n\n\"Come!\" said his host.  \"If you're in the complimentary line, you'll get\non here, for you'll meet with no competition.  I have never been in the\nway of learning compliments myself, and I don't profess to understand the\nart of paying 'em.  In fact, despise 'em.  But, your bringing-up was\ndifferent from mine; mine was a real thing, by George!  You're a\ngentleman, and I don't pretend to be one.  I am Josiah Bounderby of\nCoketown, and that's enough for me.  However, though I am not influenced\nby manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.  She hadn't my\nadvantages   disadvantages you would call 'em, but I call 'em advantages   so\nyou'll not waste your power, I dare say.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby,\" said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, \"is a noble\nanimal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in\nwhich a conventional hack like myself works.\"\n\n\"You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,\" she quietly returned.  \"It is\nnatural that you should.\"\n\nHe was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of\nthe world, and thought, \"Now, how am I to take this?\"\n\n\"You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby\nhas said, to the service of your country.  You have made up your mind,\"\nsaid Louisa, still standing before him where she had first stopped   in all\nthe singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously\nvery ill at ease   \"to show the nation the way out of all its\ndifficulties.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby,\" he returned, laughing, \"upon my honour, no.  I will\nmake no such pretence to you.  I have seen a little, here and there, up\nand down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and\nas some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your\nrespected father's opinions   really because I have no choice of opinions,\nand may as well back them as anything else.\"\n\n\"Have you none of your own?\" asked Louisa.\n\n\"I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.  I assure you I\nattach not the least importance to any opinions.  The result of the\nvarieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction\nis too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the\nsubject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other\nset, and just as much harm as any other set.  There's an English family\nwith a charming Italian motto.  What will be, will be.  It's the only\ntruth going!\"\n\nThis vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty   a vice so dangerous, so\ndeadly, and so common   seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his\nfavour.  He followed up the advantage, by saying in his pleasantest\nmanner: a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning\nas she pleased: \"The side that can prove anything in a line of units,\ntens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the\nmost fun, and to give a man the best chance.  I am quite as much attached\nto it as if I believed it.  I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same\nextent as if I believed it.  And what more could I possibly do, if I did\nbelieve it!\"\n\n\"You are a singular politician,\" said Louisa.\n\n\"Pardon me; I have not even that merit.  We are the largest party in the\nstate, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted\nranks and were reviewed together.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed\nhere with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six,\nand taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to\nthe voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity.\nThe round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet\nuse of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a\nconsiderable accession of boredom.\n\nIn the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat\ndown only three.  It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to\ndiscuss the flavour of the hap'orth of stewed eels he had purchased in\nthe streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water, specially\nused for laying the dust, with which he had washed down that repast.  He\nlikewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the\ncalculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three\nhorses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.  These recitals, Jem, in\na languid manner, received with \"charming!\" every now and then; and they\nprobably would have decided him to \"go in\" for Jerusalem again to-morrow\nmorning, had he been less curious respecting Louisa.\n\n\"Is there nothing,\" he thought, glancing at her as she sat at the head of\nthe table, where her youthful figure, small and slight, but very\ngraceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; \"is there nothing that\nwill move that face?\"\n\nYes!  By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected\nshape.  Tom appeared.  She changed as the door opened, and broke into a\nbeaming smile.\n\nA beautiful smile.  Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of\nit, but that he had wondered so long at her impassive face.  She put out\nher hand   a pretty little soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her\nbrother's, as if she would have carried them to her lips.\n\n\"Ay, ay?\" thought the visitor.  \"This whelp is the only creature she\ncares for.  So, so!\"\n\nThe whelp was presented, and took his chair.  The appellation was not\nflattering, but not unmerited.\n\n\"When I was your age, young Tom,\" said Bounderby, \"I was punctual, or I\ngot no dinner!\"\n\n\"When you were my age,\" resumed Tom, \"you hadn't a wrong balance to get\nright, and hadn't to dress afterwards.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Bounderby.\n\n\"Well, then,\" grumbled Tom.  \"Don't begin with me.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby,\" said Harthouse, perfectly hearing this under-strain as\nit went on; \"your brother's face is quite familiar to me.  Can I have\nseen him abroad?  Or at some public school, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No,\" she resumed, quite interested, \"he has never been abroad yet, and\nwas educated here, at home.  Tom, love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that\nhe never saw you abroad.\"\n\n\"No such luck, sir,\" said Tom.\n\nThere was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he was a sullen\nyoung fellow, and ungracious in his manner even to her.  So much the\ngreater must have been the solitude of her heart, and her need of some\none on whom to bestow it.  \"So much the more is this whelp the only\ncreature she has ever cared for,\" thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it\nover and over.  \"So much the more.  So much the more.\"\n\nBoth in his sister's presence, and after she had left the room, the whelp\ntook no pains to hide his contempt for Mr. Bounderby, whenever he could\nindulge it without the observation of that independent man, by making wry\nfaces, or shutting one eye.  Without responding to these telegraphic\ncommunications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the\nevening, and showed an unusual liking for him.  At last, when he rose to\nreturn to his hotel, and was a little doubtful whether he knew the way by\nnight, the whelp immediately proffered his services as guide, and turned\nout with him to escort him thither.\n\n            [Picture: Mr. Harthouse dines at the Bounderby's]\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " III\nTHE WHELP\n\n\nIT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up\nunder one continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a\nhypocrite; but it was certainly the case with Tom.  It was very strange\nthat a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for\nfive consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing\nhimself; but so it was with Tom.  It was altogether unaccountable that a\nyoung gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle,\nshould be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling\nsensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom.\n\n\"Do you smoke?\" asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel.\n\n\"I believe you!\" said Tom.\n\nHe could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up.\nWhat with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as\ncool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts;\nTom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and\nmore than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.\n\nTom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and\ntook an observation of his friend.  \"He don't seem to care about his\ndress,\" thought Tom, \"and yet how capitally he does it.  What an easy\nswell he is!\"\n\nMr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom's eye, remarked that he drank\nnothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand.\n\n\"Thank'ee,\" said Tom.  \"Thank'ee.  Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have\nhad about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\"  Tom said this with one eye\nshut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.\n\n\"A very good fellow indeed!\" returned Mr. James Harthouse.\n\n\"You think so, don't you?\" said Tom.  And shut up his eye again.\n\nMr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and\nlounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before\nthe empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at\nhim, observed:\n\n\"What a comical brother-in-law you are!\"\n\n\"What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\" said\nTom.\n\n\"You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\" retorted Mr. James Harthouse.\n\nThere was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a\nwaistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice;\nin being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers;\nthat Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself.\n\n\"Oh!  I don't care for old Bounderby,\" said he, \"if you mean that.  I\nhave always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked\nabout him, and I have always thought of him in the same way.  I am not\ngoing to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.  It would be rather\nlate in the day.\"\n\n\"Don't mind me,\" returned James; \"but take care when his wife is by, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"His wife?\" said Tom.  \"My sister Loo?  O yes!\"  And he laughed, and took\na little more of the cooling drink.\n\nJames Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude,\nsmoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the\nwhelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only\nto hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if required.  It\ncertainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence.  He looked\nat his companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at\nhim boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.\n\n\"My sister Loo?\" said Tom.  \"_She_ never cared for old Bounderby.\"\n\n\"That's the past tense, Tom,\" returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the\nash from his cigar with his little finger.  \"We are in the present tense,\nnow.\"\n\n\"Verb neuter, not to care.  Indicative mood, present tense.  First person\nsingular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care;\nthird person singular, she does not care,\" returned Tom.\n\n\"Good!  Very quaint!\" said his friend.  \"Though you don't mean it.\"\n\n\"But I _do_ mean it,\" cried Tom.  \"Upon my honour!  Why, you won't tell\nme, Mr. Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for\nold Bounderby.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" returned the other, \"what am I bound to suppose, when I\nfind two married people living in harmony and happiness?\"\n\nTom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa.  If his second leg\nhad not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would\nhave put it up at that great stage of the conversation.  Feeling it\nnecessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater\nlength, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa,\nand smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common\nface, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so\ncarelessly yet so potently.\n\n\"You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,\" said Tom, \"and therefore, you\nneedn't be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby.  She never had a\nlover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.\"\n\n\"Very dutiful in your interesting sister,\" said Mr. James Harthouse.\n\n\"Yes, but she wouldn't have been as dutiful, and it would not have come\noff as easily,\" returned the whelp, \"if it hadn't been for me.\"\n\nThe tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go\non.\n\n\"_I_ persuaded her,\" he said, with an edifying air of superiority.  \"I\nwas stuck into old Bounderby's bank (where I never wanted to be), and I\nknew I should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby's pipe\nout; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them.  She would do\nanything for me.  It was very game of her, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was charming, Tom!\"\n\n\"Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me,\"\ncontinued Tom coolly, \"because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my\ngetting on, depended on it; and she had no other lover, and staying at\nhome was like staying in jail   especially when I was gone.  It wasn't as\nif she gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was a good\nthing in her.\"\n\n\"Perfectly delightful.  And she gets on so placidly.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage, \"she's a regular girl.\nA girl can get on anywhere.  She has settled down to the life, and _she_\ndon't mind.  It does just as well as another.  Besides, though Loo is a\ngirl, she's not a common sort of girl.  She can shut herself up within\nherself, and think   as I have often known her sit and watch the fire   for\nan hour at a stretch.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay?  Has resources of her own,\" said Harthouse, smoking quietly.\n\n\"Not so much of that as you may suppose,\" returned Tom; \"for our governor\nhad her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust.  It's his\nsystem.\"\n\n\"Formed his daughter on his own model?\" suggested Harthouse.\n\n\"His daughter?  Ah! and everybody else.  Why, he formed Me that way!\"\nsaid Tom.\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"He did, though,\" said Tom, shaking his head.  \"I mean to say, Mr.\nHarthouse, that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby's, I was\nas flat as a warming-pan, and knew no more about life, than any oyster\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Come, Tom!  I can hardly believe that.  A joke's a joke.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul!\" said the whelp.  \"I am serious; I am indeed!\"  He smoked\nwith great gravity and dignity for a little while, and then added, in a\nhighly complacent tone, \"Oh!  I have picked up a little since.  I don't\ndeny that.  But I have done it myself; no thanks to the governor.\"\n\n\"And your intelligent sister?\"\n\n\"My intelligent sister is about where she was.  She used to complain to\nme that she had nothing to fall back upon, that girls usually fall back\nupon; and I don't see how she is to have got over that since.  But _she_\ndon't mind,\" he sagaciously added, puffing at his cigar again.  \"Girls\ncan always get on, somehow.\"\n\n\"Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr. Bounderby's address, I\nfound an ancient lady there, who seems to entertain great admiration for\nyour sister,\" observed Mr. James Harthouse, throwing away the last small\nremnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.\n\n\"Mother Sparsit!\" said Tom.  \"What! you have seen her already, have you?\"\n\nHis friend nodded.  Tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his\neye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression,\nand to tap his nose several times with his finger.\n\n\"Mother Sparsit's feeling for Loo is more than admiration, I should\nthink,\" said Tom.  \"Say affection and devotion.  Mother Sparsit never set\nher cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor.  Oh no!\"\n\nThese were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy drowsiness\ncame upon him, followed by complete oblivion.  He was roused from the\nlatter state by an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot, and also\nof a voice saying: \"Come, it's late.  Be off!\"\n\n\"Well!\" he said, scrambling from the sofa.  \"I must take my leave of you\nthough.  I say.  Yours is very good tobacco.  But it's too mild.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's too mild,\" returned his entertainer.\n\n\"It's   it's ridiculously mild,\" said Tom.  \"Where's the door!  Good\nnight!\"\n\nHe had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist,\nwhich, after giving him some trouble and difficulty, resolved itself into\nthe main street, in which he stood alone.  He then walked home pretty\neasily, though not yet free from an impression of the presence and\ninfluence of his new friend   as if he were lounging somewhere in the air,\nin the same negligent attitude, regarding him with the same look.\n\nThe whelp went home, and went to bed.  If he had had any sense of what he\nhad done that night, and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother,\nhe might have turned short on the road, might have gone down to the\nill-smelling river that was dyed black, might have gone to bed in it for\ngood and all, and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy\nwaters.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " IV\nMEN AND BROTHERS\n\n\n\"OH, my friends, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown!  Oh, my friends\nand fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding\ndespotism!  Oh, my friends and fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and\nfellow-men!  I tell you that the hour is come, when we must rally round\none another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors\nthat too long have battened upon the plunder of our families, upon the\nsweat of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of\nour sinews, upon the God-created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon\nthe holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!\"\n\n\"Good!\"  \"Hear, hear, hear!\"  \"Hurrah!\" and other cries, arose in many\nvoices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close\nHall, in which the orator, perched on a stage, delivered himself of this\nand what other froth and fume he had in him.  He had declaimed himself\ninto a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he was hot.  By dint of roaring\nat the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his fists,\nknitting his brows, setting his teeth, and pounding with his arms, he had\ntaken so much out of himself by this time, that he was brought to a stop,\nand called for a glass of water.\n\nAs he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of\nwater, the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces\nturned towards him, was extremely to his disadvantage.  Judging him by\nNature's evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the stage on\nwhich he stood.  In many great respects he was essentially below them.\nHe was not so honest, he was not so manly, he was not so good-humoured;\nhe substituted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their safe\nsolid sense.  An ill-made, high-shouldered man, with lowering brows, and\nhis features crushed into an habitually sour expression, he contrasted\nmost unfavourably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of his\nhearers in their plain working clothes.  Strange as it always is to\nconsider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the\ndreariness of some complacent person, lord or commoner, whom\nthree-fourths of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough of\ninanity to their own intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and\nit was even particularly affecting, to see this crowd of earnest faces,\nwhose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could\ndoubt, so agitated by such a leader.\n\nGood!  Hear, hear!  Hurrah!  The eagerness both of attention and\nintention, exhibited in all the countenances, made them a most impressive\nsight.  There was no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of\nthe many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies,\nvisible for one moment there.  That every man felt his condition to be,\nsomehow or other, worse than it might be; that every man considered it\nincumbent on him to join the rest, towards the making of it better; that\nevery man felt his only hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades\nby whom he was surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong\n(unhappily wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply,\nfaithfully in earnest; must have been as plain to any one who chose to\nsee what was there, as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick\nwalls.  Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast, that\nthese men, through their very delusions, showed great qualities,\nsusceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account; and that to\npretend (on the strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried)\nthat they went astray wholly without cause, and of their own irrational\nwills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire, death\nwithout birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything produced from\nnothing.\n\nThe orator having refreshed himself, wiped his corrugated forehead from\nleft to right several times with his handkerchief folded into a pad, and\nconcentrated all his revived forces, in a sneer of great disdain and\nbitterness.\n\n\"But oh, my friends and brothers!  Oh, men and Englishmen, the\ndown-trodden operatives of Coketown!  What shall we say of that man   that\nworking-man, that I should find it necessary so to libel the glorious\nname   who, being practically and well acquainted with the grievances and\nwrongs of you, the injured pith and marrow of this land, and having heard\nyou, with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants tremble,\nresolve for to subscribe to the funds of the United Aggregate Tribunal,\nand to abide by the injunctions issued by that body for your benefit,\nwhatever they may be   what, I ask you, will you say of that working-man,\nsince such I must acknowledge him to be, who, at such a time, deserts his\npost, and sells his flag; who, at such a time, turns a traitor and a\ncraven and a recreant, who, at such a time, is not ashamed to make to you\nthe dastardly and humiliating avowal that he will hold himself aloof, and\nwill _not_ be one of those associated in the gallant stand for Freedom\nand for Right?\"\n\nThe assembly was divided at this point.  There were some groans and\nhisses, but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the\ncondemnation of a man unheard.  \"Be sure you're right, Slackbridge!\"\n\"Put him up!\"  \"Let's hear him!\"  Such things were said on many sides.\nFinally, one strong voice called out, \"Is the man heer?  If the man's\nheer, Slackbridge, let's hear the man himseln, 'stead o' yo.\"  Which was\nreceived with a round of applause.\n\nSlackbridge, the orator, looked about him with a withering smile; and,\nholding out his right hand at arm's length (as the manner of all\nSlackbridges is), to still the thundering sea, waited until there was a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Oh, my friends and fellow-men!\" said Slackbridge then, shaking his head\nwith violent scorn, \"I do not wonder that you, the prostrate sons of\nlabour, are incredulous of the existence of such a man.  But he who sold\nhis birthright for a mess of pottage existed, and Judas Iscariot existed,\nand Castlereagh existed, and this man exists!\"\n\nHere, a brief press and confusion near the stage, ended in the man\nhimself standing at the orator's side before the concourse.  He was pale\nand a little moved in the face   his lips especially showed it; but he\nstood quiet, with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be heard.  There\nwas a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary now took\nthe case into his own hands.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"by virtue o' my office as your president, I askes\no' our friend Slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this\nbusiness, to take his seat, whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern.\nYou all know this man Stephen Blackpool.  You know him awlung o' his\nmisfort'ns, and his good name.\"\n\nWith that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat down\nagain.  Slackbridge likewise sat down, wiping his hot forehead   always\nfrom left to right, and never the reverse way.\n\n\"My friends,\" Stephen began, in the midst of a dead calm; \"I ha' hed\nwhat's been spok'n o' me, and 'tis lickly that I shan't mend it.  But I'd\nliefer you'd hearn the truth concernin myseln, fro my lips than fro onny\nother man's, though I never cud'n speak afore so monny, wi'out bein\nmoydert and muddled.\"\n\nSlackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off, in his\nbitterness.\n\n\"I'm th' one single Hand in Bounderby's mill, o' a' the men theer, as\ndon't coom in wi' th' proposed reg'lations.  I canna coom in wi' 'em.  My\nfriends, I doubt their doin' yo onny good.  Licker they'll do yo hurt.\"\n\nSlackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically.\n\n\"But 't an't sommuch for that as I stands out.  If that were aw, I'd coom\nin wi' th' rest.  But I ha' my reasons   mine, yo see   for being hindered;\nnot on'y now, but awlus   awlus   life long!\"\n\nSlackbridge jumped up and stood beside him, gnashing and tearing.  \"Oh,\nmy friends, what but this did I tell you?  Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what\nwarning but this did I give you?  And how shows this recreant conduct in\na man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?  Oh, you\nEnglishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of\nyourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and\nto your children's and your children's children's?\"\n\nThere was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the man; but the\ngreater part of the audience were quiet.  They looked at Stephen's worn\nface, rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and, in\nthe kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than indignant.\n\n\"'Tis this Delegate's trade for t' speak,\" said Stephen, \"an' he's paid\nfor 't, an' he knows his work.  Let him keep to 't.  Let him give no heed\nto what I ha had'n to bear.  That's not for him.  That's not for nobbody\nbut me.\"\n\nThere was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the\nhearers yet more quiet and attentive.  The same strong voice called out,\n\"Slackbridge, let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!\"  Then the\nplace was wonderfully still.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said Stephen, whose low voice was distinctly heard, \"and\nmy fellow-workmen   for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to\nthis delegate here   I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore if I\nwas to speak till Strike o' day.  I know weel, aw what's afore me.  I\nknow weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi' a man who is not wi'\nyo in this matther.  I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i' th'\nroad, yo'd feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger.\nWhat I ha getn, I mun mak th' best on.\"\n\n\"Stephen Blackpool,\" said the chairman, rising, \"think on 't agen.  Think\non 't once agen, lad, afore thou'rt shunned by aw owd friends.\"\n\nThere was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man\narticulated a word.  Every eye was fixed on Stephen's face.  To repent of\nhis determination, would be to take a load from all their minds.  He\nlooked around him, and knew that it was so.  Not a grain of anger with\nthem was in his heart; he knew them, far below their surface weaknesses\nand misconceptions, as no one but their fellow-labourer could.\n\n\"I ha thowt on 't, above a bit, sir.  I simply canna coom in.  I mun go\nth' way as lays afore me.  I mun tak my leave o' aw heer.\"\n\nHe made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his arms, and stood for\nthe moment in that attitude; not speaking until they slowly dropped at\nhis sides.\n\n\"Monny's the pleasant word as soom heer has spok'n wi' me; monny's the\nface I see heer, as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart'n\nthan now.  I ha' never had no fratch afore, sin ever I were born, wi' any\no' my like; Gonnows I ha' none now that's o' my makin'.  Yo'll ca' me\ntraitor and that   yo I mean t' say,\" addressing Slackbridge, \"but 'tis\neasier to ca' than mak' out.  So let be.\"\n\nHe had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform, when he\nremembered something he had not said, and returned again.\n\n\"Haply,\" he said, turning his furrowed face slowly about, that he might\nas it were individually address the whole audience, those both near and\ndistant; \"haply, when this question has been tak'n up and discoosed,\nthere'll be a threat to turn out if I'm let to work among yo.  I hope I\nshall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo\nunless it cooms   truly, I mun do 't, my friends; not to brave yo, but to\nlive.  I ha nobbut work to live by; and wheerever can I go, I who ha\nworked sin I were no heighth at aw, in Coketown heer?  I mak' no\ncomplaints o' bein turned to the wa', o' bein outcasten and overlooken\nfro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to work.  If there is any\nright for me at aw, my friends, I think 'tis that.\"\n\nNot a word was spoken.  Not a sound was audible in the building, but the\nslight rustle of men moving a little apart, all along the centre of the\nroom, to open a means of passing out, to the man with whom they had all\nbound themselves to renounce companionship.  Looking at no one, and going\nhis way with a lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought\nnothing, Old Stephen, with all his troubles on his head, left the scene.\n\nThen Slackbridge, who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the\ngoing out, as if he were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a\nwonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude, applied\nhimself to raising their spirits.  Had not the Roman Brutus, oh, my\nBritish countrymen, condemned his son to death; and had not the Spartan\nmothers, oh my soon to be victorious friends, driven their flying\nchildren on the points of their enemies' swords?  Then was it not the\nsacred duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an\nadmiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come after them,\nto hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a\nGod-like cause?  The winds of heaven answered Yes; and bore Yes, east,\nwest, north, and south.  And consequently three cheers for the United\nAggregate Tribunal!\n\nSlackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time.  The multitude of\ndoubtful faces (a little conscience-stricken) brightened at the sound,\nand took it up.  Private feeling must yield to the common cause.  Hurrah!\nThe roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly dispersed.\n\nThus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives, the\nlife of solitude among a familiar crowd.  The stranger in the land who\nlooks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it,\nis in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces\ndaily, that were once the countenances of friends.  Such experience was\nto be Stephen's now, in every waking moment of his life; at his work, on\nhis way to it and from it, at his door, at his window, everywhere.  By\ngeneral consent, they even avoided that side of the street on which he\nhabitually walked; and left it, of all the working men, to him only.\n\nHe had been for many years, a quiet silent man, associating but little\nwith other men, and used to companionship with his own thoughts.  He had\nnever known before the strength of the want in his heart for the frequent\nrecognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the immense amount of relief\nthat had been poured into it by drops through such small means.  It was\neven harder than he could have believed possible, to separate in his own\nconscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of\nshame and disgrace.\n\nThe first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy, that he\nbegan to be appalled by the prospect before him.  Not only did he see no\nRachael all the time, but he avoided every chance of seeing her; for,\nalthough he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the\nwomen working in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he\nwas acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and\ndreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were\nseen in his company.  So, he had been quite alone during the four days,\nand had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work at night, a\nyoung man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street.\n\n\"Your name's Blackpool, ain't it?\" said the young man.\n\nStephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand, in his\ngratitude for being spoken to, or in the suddenness of it, or both.  He\nmade a feint of adjusting the lining, and said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I mean?\" said Bitzer, the\nvery light young man in question.\n\nStephen answered \"Yes,\" again.\n\n\"I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you.  Mr.\nBounderby wants to speak to you.  You know his house, don't you?\"\n\nStephen said \"Yes,\" again.\n\n\"Then go straight up there, will you?\" said Bitzer.  \"You're expected,\nand have only to tell the servant it's you.  I belong to the Bank; so, if\nyou go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you'll save me a\nwalk.\"\n\nStephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and\nbetook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant\nBounderby.\n\n\n\n",

Come in,\nand speak up.\"\n\nIt was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden.  A tea-table was\nset out; and Mr. Bounderby's young wife, and her brother, and a great\ngentleman from London, were present.  To whom Stephen made his obeisance,\nclosing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand.\n\n\"This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\" said Mr. Bounderby.\nThe gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the\nsofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \"Oh really?\" and dawdled to the\nhearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood.\n\n\"Now,\" said Bounderby, \"speak up!\"\n\nAfter the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and\ndiscordantly on Stephen's ear.  Besides being a rough handling of his\nwounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested\ndeserter he had been called.\n\n\"What were it, sir,\" said Stephen, \"as yo were pleased to want wi' me?\"\n\n\"Why, I have told you,\" returned Bounderby.  \"Speak up like a man, since\nyou are a man, and tell us about yourself and this Combination.\"\n\n\"Wi' yor pardon, sir,\" said Stephen Blackpool, \"I ha' nowt to sen about\nit.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind, finding something\nin his way here, began to blow at it directly.\n\n\"Now, look here, Harthouse,\" said he, \"here's a specimen of 'em.  When\nthis man was here once before, I warned this man against the mischievous\nstrangers who are always about   and who ought to be hanged wherever they\nare found   and I told this man that he was going in the wrong direction.\nNow, would you believe it, that although they have put this mark upon\nhim, he is such a slave to them still, that he's afraid to open his lips\nabout them?\"\n\n\"I sed as I had nowt to sen, sir; not as I was fearfo' o' openin' my\nlips.\"\n\n\"You said!  Ah!  _I_ know what you said; more than that, I know what you\nmean, you see.  Not always the same thing, by the Lord Harry!  Quite\ndifferent things.  You had better tell us at once, that that fellow\nSlackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny; and\nthat he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most\nconfounded scoundrel.  You had better tell us so at once; you can't\ndeceive me.  You want to tell us so.  Why don't you?\"\n\n\"I'm as sooary as yo, sir, when the people's leaders is bad,\" said\nStephen, shaking his head.  \"They taks such as offers.  Haply 'tis na'\nthe sma'est o' their misfortuns when they can get no better.\"\n\nThe wind began to get boisterous.\n\n\"Now, you'll think this pretty well, Harthouse,\" said Mr. Bounderby.\n\"You'll think this tolerably strong.  You'll say, upon my soul this is a\ntidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing,\nsir!  You shall hear me ask this man a question.  Pray, Mr.\nBlackpool\"   wind springing up very fast   \"may I take the liberty of asking\nyou how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination?\"\n\n\"How 't happens?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the arms of his coat, and\njerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite\nwall: \"how it happens.\"\n\n\"I'd leefer not coom to 't, sir; but sin you put th' question   an' not\nwant'n t' be ill-manner'n   I'll answer.  I ha passed a promess.\"\n\n\"Not to me, you know,\" said Bounderby.  (Gusty weather with deceitful\ncalms.  One now prevailing.)\n\n\"O no, sir.  Not to yo.\"\n\n\"As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do\nwith it,\" said Bounderby, still in confidence with the wall.  \"If only\nJosiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined\nand made no bones about it?\"\n\n\"Why yes, sir.  'Tis true.\"\n\n\"Though he knows,\" said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing a gale, \"that there\nare a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for!\nNow, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time.\nDid you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed\ncountry?\"  And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an\nangry finger.\n\n\"Nay, ma'am,\" said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the\nwords that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa,\nafter glancing at her face.  \"Not rebels, nor yet rascals.  Nowt o' th'\nkind, ma'am, nowt o' th' kind.  They've not doon me a kindness, ma'am, as\nI know and feel.  But there's not a dozen men amoong 'em, ma'am   a dozen?\nNot six   but what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by\nhimseln.  God forbid as I, that ha' known, and had'n experience o' these\nmen aw my life   I, that ha' ett'n an' droonken wi' 'em, an' seet'n wi'\n'em, and toil'n wi' 'em, and lov'n 'em, should fail fur to stan by 'em\nwi' the truth, let 'em ha' doon to me what they may!\"\n\nHe spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and character   deepened\nperhaps by a proud consciousness that he was faithful to his class under\nall their mistrust; but he fully remembered where he was, and did not\neven raise his voice.\n\n\"No, ma'am, no.  They're true to one another, faithfo' to one another,\n'fectionate to one another, e'en to death.  Be poor amoong 'em, be sick\namoong 'em, grieve amoong 'em for onny o' th' monny causes that carries\ngrief to the poor man's door, an' they'll be tender wi' yo, gentle wi'\nyo, comfortable wi' yo, Chrisen wi' yo.  Be sure o' that, ma'am.  They'd\nbe riven to bits, ere ever they'd be different.\"\n\n\"In short,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"it's because they are so full of virtues\nthat they have turned you adrift.  Go through with it while you are about\nit.  Out with it.\"\n\n\"How 'tis, ma'am,\" resumed Stephen, appearing still to find his natural\nrefuge in Louisa's face, \"that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us\nmost to trouble an' misfort'n an' mistake, I dunno.  But 'tis so.  I know\n'tis, as I know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke.  We're patient\ntoo, an' wants in general to do right.  An' I canna think the fawt is aw\nwi' us.\"\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said Mr. Bounderby, whom he could not have exasperated\nmore, quite unconscious of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to\nany one else, \"if you will favour me with your attention for half a\nminute, I should like to have a word or two with you.  You said just now,\nthat you had nothing to tell us about this business.  You are quite sure\nof that before we go any further.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am sure on 't.\"\n\n\"Here's a gentleman from London present,\" Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded\npoint at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb, \"a Parliament gentleman.  I\nshould like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me,\ninstead of taking the substance of it   for I know precious well,\nbeforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take\nnotice!   instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth.\"\n\nStephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather\nmore troubled mind than usual.  He turned his eyes involuntarily to his\nformer refuge, but at a look from that quarter (expressive though\ninstantaneous) he settled them on Mr. Bounderby's face.\n\n\"Now, what do you complain of?\" asked Mr. Bounderby.\n\n\"I ha' not coom here, sir,\" Stephen reminded him, \"to complain.  I coom\nfor that I were sent for.\"\n\n\"What,\" repeated Mr. Bounderby, folding his arms, \"do you people, in a\ngeneral way, complain of?\"\n\nStephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a moment, and\nthen seemed to make up his mind.\n\n\"Sir, I were never good at showin o 't, though I ha had'n my share in\nfeeling o 't.  'Deed we are in a muddle, sir.  Look round town   so rich as\n'tis   and see the numbers o' people as has been broughten into bein heer,\nfur to weave, an' to card, an' to piece out a livin', aw the same one\nway, somehows, 'twixt their cradles and their graves.  Look how we live,\nan' wheer we live, an' in what numbers, an' by what chances, and wi' what\nsameness; and look how the mills is awlus a goin, and how they never\nworks us no nigher to ony dis'ant object   ceptin awlus, Death.  Look how\nyou considers of us, and writes of us, and talks of us, and goes up wi'\nyor deputations to Secretaries o' State 'bout us, and how yo are awlus\nright, and how we are awlus wrong, and never had'n no reason in us sin\never we were born.  Look how this ha growen an' growen, sir, bigger an'\nbigger, broader an' broader, harder an' harder, fro year to year, fro\ngeneration unto generation.  Who can look on 't, sir, and fairly tell a\nman 'tis not a muddle?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Bounderby.  \"Now perhaps you'll let the gentleman\nknow, how you would set this muddle (as you're so fond of calling it) to\nrights.\"\n\n\"I donno, sir.  I canna be expecten to 't.  'Tis not me as should be\nlooken to for that, sir.  'Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw the\nrest of us.  What do they tak upon themseln, sir, if not to do't?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you something towards it, at any rate,\" returned Mr.\nBounderby.  \"We will make an example of half a dozen Slackbridges.  We'll\nindict the blackguards for felony, and get 'em shipped off to penal\nsettlements.\"\n\nStephen gravely shook his head.\n\n\"Don't tell me we won't, man,\" said Mr. Bounderby, by this time blowing a\nhurricane, \"because we will, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Stephen, with the quiet confidence of absolute certainty,\n\"if yo was t' tak a hundred Slackbridges   aw as there is, and aw the\nnumber ten times towd   an' was t' sew 'em up in separate sacks, an' sink\n'em in the deepest ocean as were made ere ever dry land coom to be, yo'd\nleave the muddle just wheer 'tis.  Mischeevous strangers!\" said Stephen,\nwith an anxious smile; \"when ha we not heern, I am sure, sin ever we can\ncall to mind, o' th' mischeevous strangers!  'Tis not by _them_ the\ntrouble's made, sir.  'Tis not wi' _them_ 't commences.  I ha no favour\nfor 'em   I ha no reason to favour 'em   but 'tis hopeless and useless to\ndream o' takin them fro their trade, 'stead o' takin their trade fro\nthem!  Aw that's now about me in this room were heer afore I coom, an'\nwill be heer when I am gone.  Put that clock aboard a ship an' pack it\noff to Norfolk Island, an' the time will go on just the same.  So 'tis\nwi' Slackbridge every bit.\"\n\nReverting for a moment to his former refuge, he observed a cautionary\nmovement of her eyes towards the door.  Stepping back, he put his hand\nupon the lock.  But he had not spoken out of his own will and desire; and\nhe felt it in his heart a noble return for his late injurious treatment\nto be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him.  He stayed to\nfinish what was in his mind.\n\n\"Sir, I canna, wi' my little learning an' my common way, tell the\ngenelman what will better aw this   though some working men o' this town\ncould, above my powers   but I can tell him what I know will never do 't.\nThe strong hand will never do 't.  Vict'ry and triumph will never do 't.\nAgreeing fur to mak one side unnat'rally awlus and for ever right, and\ntoother side unnat'rally awlus and for ever wrong, will never, never do\n't.  Nor yet lettin alone will never do 't.  Let thousands upon thousands\nalone, aw leading the like lives and aw faw'en into the like muddle, and\nthey will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi' a black unpassable\nworld betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can\nlast.  Not drawin nigh to fok, wi' kindness and patience an' cheery ways,\nthat so draws nigh to one another in their monny troubles, and so\ncherishes one another in their distresses wi' what they need\nthemseln   like, I humbly believe, as no people the genelman ha seen in aw\nhis travels can beat   will never do 't till th' Sun turns t' ice.  Most o'\naw, rating 'em as so much Power, and reg'latin 'em as if they was figures\nin a soom, or machines: wi'out loves and likens, wi'out memories and\ninclinations, wi'out souls to weary and souls to hope   when aw goes quiet,\ndraggin on wi' 'em as if they'd nowt o' th' kind, and when aw goes\nonquiet, reproachin 'em for their want o' sitch humanly feelins in their\ndealins wi' yo   this will never do 't, sir, till God's work is onmade.\"\n\nStephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting to know if anything\nmore were expected of him.\n\n\"Just stop a moment,\" said Mr. Bounderby, excessively red in the face.\n\"I told you, the last time you were here with a grievance, that you had\nbetter turn about and come out of that.  And I also told you, if you\nremember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.\"\n\n\"I were not up to 't myseln, sir; I do assure yo.\"\n\n\"Now it's clear to me,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"that you are one of those\nchaps who have always got a grievance.  And you go about, sowing it and\nraising crops.  That's the business of _your_ life, my friend.\"\n\nStephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had other\nbusiness to do for his life.\n\n\"You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see,\" said\nMr. Bounderby, \"that even your own Union, the men who know you best, will\nhave nothing to do with you.  I never thought those fellows could be\nright in anything; but I tell you what!  I so far go along with them for\na novelty, that _I_'ll have nothing to do with you either.\"\n\nStephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.\n\n\"You can finish off what you're at,\" said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning\nnod, \"and then go elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Sir, yo know weel,\" said Stephen expressively, \"that if I canna get work\nwi' yo, I canna get it elsewheer.\"\n\nThe reply was, \"What I know, I know; and what you know, you know.  I have\nno more to say about it.\"\n\nStephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were raised to his no more;\ntherefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his breath, \"Heaven help\nus aw in this world!\" he departed.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VI\nFADING AWAY\n\n\nIT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby's house.  The\nshadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him\nwhen he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.  Nothing\nwas further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had\nencountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step\nbehind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael's company.\n\nHe saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only.\n\n\"Ah, Rachael, my dear!  Missus, thou wi' her!\"\n\n\"Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,\"\nthe old woman returned.  \"Here I am again, you see.\"\n\n\"But how wi' Rachael?\" said Stephen, falling into their step, walking\nbetween them, and looking from the one to the other.\n\n\"Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with\nyou,\" said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself.  \"My\nvisiting time is later this year than usual, for I have been rather\ntroubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was\nfine and warm.  For the same reason I don't make all my journey in one\nday, but divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the\nTravellers' Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house), and\ngo back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.  Well, but what has this to\ndo with this good lass, says you?  I'm going to tell you.  I have heard\nof Mr. Bounderby being married.  I read it in the paper, where it looked\ngrand   oh, it looked fine!\" the old woman dwelt on it with strange\nenthusiasm: \"and I want to see his wife.  I have never seen her yet.\nNow, if you'll believe me, she hasn't come out of that house since noon\nto-day.  So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little\nlast bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times;\nand her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me.\nThere!\" said the old woman to Stephen, \"you can make all the rest out for\nyourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\"\n\nOnce again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike\nthis old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner\npossibly could be.  With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he\nknew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in\nher old age.\n\n\"Well, missus,\" said he, \"I ha seen the lady, and she were young and\nhansom.  Wi' fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha\nnever seen the like on.\"\n\n\"Young and handsome.  Yes!\" cried the old woman, quite delighted.  \"As\nbonny as a rose!  And what a happy wife!\"\n\n\"Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\" said Stephen.  But with a doubtful\nglance at Rachael.\n\n\"Suppose she be?  She must be.  She's your master's wife,\" returned the\nold woman.\n\nStephen nodded assent.  \"Though as to master,\" said he, glancing again at\nRachael, \"not master onny more.  That's aw enden 'twixt him and me.\"\n\n\"Have you left his work, Stephen?\" asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly.\n\n\"Why, Rachael,\" he replied, \"whether I ha lef'n his work, or whether his\nwork ha lef'n me, cooms t' th' same.  His work and me are parted.  'Tis\nas weel so   better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi' me.  It would ha\nbrought'n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer.  Haply 'tis a\nkindness to monny that I go; haply 'tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it\nmun be done.  I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th' time, and seek a\nfort'n, dear, by beginnin fresh.\"\n\n\"Where will you go, Stephen?\"\n\n\"I donno t'night,\" said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin\nhair with the flat of his hand.  \"But I'm not goin t'night, Rachael, nor\nyet t'morrow.  'Tan't easy overmuch t' know wheer t' turn, but a good\nheart will coom to me.\"\n\nHerein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.  Before he\nhad so much as closed Mr. Bounderby's door, he had reflected that at\nleast his being obliged to go away was good for her, as it would save her\nfrom the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from\nhim.  Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he\ncould think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not\npursue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the\nendurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties and\ndistresses.\n\nSo he said, with truth, \"I'm more leetsome, Rachael, under 't, than I\ncould'n ha believed.\"  It was not her part to make his burden heavier.\nShe answered with her comforting smile, and the three walked on together.\n\nAge, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds\nmuch consideration among the poor.  The old woman was so decent and\ncontented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had\nincreased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they\nboth took an interest in her.  She was too sprightly to allow of their\nwalking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be\ntalked to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to\ntheir part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.\n\n\"Come to my poor place, missus,\" said Stephen, \"and tak a coop o' tea.\nRachael will coom then; and arterwards I'll see thee safe t' thy\nTravellers' lodgin.  'T may be long, Rachael, ere ever I ha th' chance o'\nthy coompany agen.\"\n\nThey complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged.  When\nthey turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a\ndread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had\nleft it, and no one was there.  The evil spirit of his life had flitted\naway again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.  The only\nevidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room,\nand the grayer hair upon his head.\n\nHe lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from\nbelow, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some\nbutter from the nearest shop.  The bread was new and crusty, the butter\nfresh, and the sugar lump, of course   in fulfilment of the standard\ntestimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes,\nsir.  Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing\nof a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily.  It was the first glimpse\nof sociality the host had had for many days.  He too, with the world a\nwide heath before him, enjoyed the meal   again in corroboration of the\nmagnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of\nthese people, sir.\n\n\"I ha never thowt yet, missus,\" said Stephen, \"o' askin thy name.\"\n\nThe old lady announced herself as \"Mrs. Pegler.\"\n\n\"A widder, I think?\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Oh, many long years!\"  Mrs. Pegler's husband (one of the best on record)\nwas already dead, by Mrs. Pegler's calculation, when Stephen was born.\n\n\"'Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\" said Stephen.  \"Onny\nchildren?\"\n\nMrs. Pegler's cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted\nsome nervousness on her part.  \"No,\" she said.  \"Not now, not now.\"\n\n\"Dead, Stephen,\" Rachael softly hinted.\n\n\"I'm sooary I ha spok'n on 't,\" said Stephen, \"I ought t' hadn in my mind\nas I might touch a sore place.  I   I blame myseln.\"\n\nWhile he excused himself, the old lady's cup rattled more and more.  \"I\nhad a son,\" she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual\nappearances of sorrow; \"and he did well, wonderfully well.  But he is not\nto be spoken of if you please.  He is   \"  Putting down her cup, she moved\nher hands as if she would have added, by her action, \"dead!\"  Then she\nsaid aloud, \"I have lost him.\"\n\nStephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain,\nwhen his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to\nthe door, whispered in his ear.  Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for\nshe caught a word as it was uttered.\n\n\"Bounderby!\" she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the\ntable.  \"Oh hide me!  Don't let me be seen for the world.  Don't let him\ncome up till I've got away.  Pray, pray!\"  She trembled, and was\nexcessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to\nreassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.\n\n\"But hearken, missus, hearken,\" said Stephen, astonished.  \"'Tisn't Mr.\nBounderby; 'tis his wife.  Yo'r not fearfo' o' her.  Yo was hey-go-mad\nabout her, but an hour sin.\"\n\n\"But are you sure it's the lady, and not the gentleman?\" she asked, still\ntrembling.\n\n\"Certain sure!\"\n\n\"Well then, pray don't speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,\" said\nthe old woman.  \"Let me be quite to myself in this corner.\"\n\nStephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was\nquite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few\nmoments returned, lighting Louisa into the room.  She was followed by the\nwhelp.\n\nRachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand,\nwhen Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle\non the table.  Then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table\nnear it, waiting to be addressed.\n\nFor the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings\nof the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to\nface with anything like individuality in connection with them.  She knew\nof their existence by hundreds and by thousands.  She knew what results\nin work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time.\nShe knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants or\nbeetles.  But she knew from her reading infinitely more of the ways of\ntoiling insects than of these toiling men and women.\n\nSomething to be worked so much and paid so much, and there ended;\nsomething to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand;\nsomething that blundered against those laws, and floundered into\ndifficulty; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear, and\nover-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something that increased at such a\nrate of percentage, and yielded such another percentage of crime, and\nsuch another percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of which vast\nfortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a sea, and did\nsome harm and waste (chiefly to itself), and fell again; this she knew\nthe Coketown Hands to be.  But, she had scarcely thought more of\nseparating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its\ncomponent drops.\n\nShe stood for some moments looking round the room.  From the few chairs,\nthe few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two\nwomen, and to Stephen.\n\n\"I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  I\nshould like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  Is this your\nwife?\"\n\nRachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped\nagain.\n\n\"I remember,\" said Louisa, reddening at her mistake; \"I recollect, now,\nto have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not\nattending to the particulars at the time.  It was not my meaning to ask a\nquestion that would give pain to any one here.  If I should ask any other\nquestion that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you\nplease, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.\"\n\nAs Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to\nher, so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.  Her manner\nwas short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid.\n\n\"He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  You\nwould be his first resource, I think.\"\n\n\"I have heard the end of it, young lady,\" said Rachael.\n\n\"Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would\nprobably be rejected by all?  I thought he said as much?\"\n\n\"The chances are very small, young lady   next to nothing   for a man who\ngets a bad name among them.\"\n\n\"What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?\"\n\n\"The name of being troublesome.\"\n\n\"Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the\nother, he is sacrificed alike?  Are the two so deeply separated in this\ntown, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between\nthem?\"\n\nRachael shook her head in silence.\n\n\"He fell into suspicion,\" said Louisa, \"with his fellow-weavers,\nbecause   he had made a promise not to be one of them.  I think it must\nhave been to you that he made that promise.  Might I ask you why he made\nit?\"\n\nRachael burst into tears.  \"I didn't seek it of him, poor lad.  I prayed\nhim to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking he'd come to it\nthrough me.  But I know he'd die a hundred deaths, ere ever he'd break\nhis word.  I know that of him well.\"\n\nStephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude,\nwith his hand at his chin.  He now spoke in a voice rather less steady\nthan usual.\n\n\"No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an' what love, an'\nrespect, I bear to Rachael, or wi' what cause.  When I passed that\npromess, I towd her true, she were th' Angel o' my life.  'Twere a solemn\npromess.  'Tis gone fro' me, for ever.\"\n\nLouisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new\nin her.  She looked from him to Rachael, and her features softened.\n\"What will you do?\" she asked him.  And her voice had softened too.\n\n\"Weel, ma'am,\" said Stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; \"when I\nha finished off, I mun quit this part, and try another.  Fortnet or\nmisfortnet, a man can but try; there's nowt to be done wi'out tryin'   cept\nlaying down and dying.\"\n\n\"How will you travel?\"\n\n\"Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.\"\n\nLouisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  The rustling of a\nbank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.\n\n\"Rachael, will you tell him   for you know how, without offence   that this\nis freely his, to help him on his way?  Will you entreat him to take it?\"\n\n\"I canna do that, young lady,\" she answered, turning her head aside.\n\"Bless you for thinking o' the poor lad wi' such tenderness.  But 'tis\nfor him to know his heart, and what is right according to it.\"\n\nLouisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome\nwith quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been\nso plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a\nmoment, and now stood with his hand before his face.  She stretched out\nhers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and\nremained still.\n\n\"Not e'en Rachael,\" said Stephen, when he stood again with his face\nuncovered, \"could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.  T'\nshow that I'm not a man wi'out reason and gratitude, I'll tak two pound.\nI'll borrow 't for t' pay 't back.  'Twill be the sweetest work as ever I\nha done, that puts it in my power t' acknowledge once more my lastin\nthankfulness for this present action.\"\n\nShe was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much\nsmaller sum he had named.  He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor\npicturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of\nexpressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord\nChesterfield could not have taught his son in a century.\n\nTom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick\nwith sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.\nSeeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put\nin a word.\n\n\"Just wait a moment, Loo!  Before we go, I should like to speak to him a\nmoment.  Something comes into my head.  If you'll step out on the stairs,\nBlackpool, I'll mention it.  Never mind a light, man!\"  Tom was\nremarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one.  \"It\ndon't want a light.\"\n\nStephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock\nin his hand.\n\n\"I say!\" he whispered.  \"I think I can do you a good turn.  Don't ask me\nwhat it is, because it may not come to anything.  But there's no harm in\nmy trying.\"\n\nHis breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen's ear, it was so hot.\n\n\"That was our light porter at the Bank,\" said Tom, \"who brought you the\nmessage to-night.  I call him our light porter, because I belong to the\nBank too.\"\n\nStephen thought, \"What a hurry he is in!\"  He spoke so confusedly.\n\n\"Well!\" said Tom.  \"Now look here!  When are you off?\"\n\n\"T' day's Monday,\" replied Stephen, considering.  \"Why, sir, Friday or\nSaturday, nigh 'bout.\"\n\n\"Friday or Saturday,\" said Tom.  \"Now look here!  I am not sure that I\ncan do you the good turn I want to do you   that's my sister, you know, in\nyour room   but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there's\nno harm done.  So I tell you what.  You'll know our light porter again?\"\n\n\"Yes, sure,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Very well,\" returned Tom.  \"When you leave work of a night, between this\nand your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?\nDon't take on, as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging\nabout there; because I shan't put him up to speak to you, unless I find I\ncan do you the service I want to do you.  In that case he'll have a note\nor a message for you, but not else.  Now look here!  You are sure you\nunderstand.\"\n\nHe had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of\nStephen's coat, and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up\nround and round, in an extraordinary manner.\n\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Stephen.\n\n\"Now look here!\" repeated Tom.  \"Be sure you don't make any mistake then,\nand don't forget.  I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have in\nview, and she'll approve, I know.  Now look here!  You're all right, are\nyou?  You understand all about it?  Very well then.  Come along, Loo!\"\n\nHe pushed the door open as he called to her, but did not return into the\nroom, or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs.  He was at the bottom\nwhen she began to descend, and was in the street before she could take\nhis arm.\n\nMrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were\ngone, and until Stephen came back with the candle in his hand.  She was\nin a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby, and, like an\nunaccountable old woman, wept, \"because she was such a pretty dear.\"  Yet\nMrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should\nreturn by chance, or anybody else should come, that her cheerfulness was\nended for that night.  It was late too, to people who rose early and\nworked hard; therefore the party broke up; and Stephen and Rachael\nescorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers'\nCoffee House, where they parted from her.\n\nThey walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael\nlived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.\nWhen they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always\nended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to speak.\n\n\"I shall strive t' see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go, but if not   \"\n\n\"Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.  'Tis better that we make up our minds\nto be open wi' one another.\"\n\n\"Thou'rt awlus right.  'Tis bolder and better.  I ha been thinkin then,\nRachael, that as 'tis but a day or two that remains, 'twere better for\nthee, my dear, not t' be seen wi' me.  'T might bring thee into trouble,\nfur no good.\"\n\n\"'Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind.  But thou know'st our old\nagreement.  'Tis for that.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he.  \"'Tis better, onnyways.\"\n\n\"Thou'lt write to me, and tell me all that happens, Stephen?\"\n\n\"Yes.  What can I say now, but Heaven be wi' thee, Heaven bless thee,\nHeaven thank thee and reward thee!\"\n\n\"May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings, and send thee\npeace and rest at last!\"\n\n\"I towd thee, my dear,\" said Stephen Blackpool   \"that night   that I would\nnever see or think o' onnything that angered me, but thou, so much better\nthan me, should'st be beside it.  Thou'rt beside it now.  Thou mak'st me\nsee it wi' a better eye.  Bless thee.  Good night.  Good-bye!\"\n\nIt was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a sacred\nremembrance to these two common people.  Utilitarian economists,\nskeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up\ninfidels, gabblers of many little dog's-eared creeds, the poor you will\nhave always with you.  Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the\nutmost graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much\nin need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance is\nutterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence stand\nface to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you.\n\nStephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any\none, and shunned in all his comings and goings as before.  At the end of\nthe second day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood\nempty.\n\nHe had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the\ntwo first evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad.  That he\nmight not be remiss in his part of the engagement, he resolved to wait\nfull two hours, on this third and last night.\n\nThere was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby's house, sitting at\nthe first-floor window as he had seen her before; and there was the light\nporter, sometimes talking with her there, and sometimes looking over the\nblind below which had BANK upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and\nstanding on the steps for a breath of air.  When he first came out,\nStephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the\nlight porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said\nnothing.\n\nTwo hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day's\nlabour.  Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under\nan archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped\nand watched children playing in the street.  Some purpose or other is so\nnatural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels\nremarkable.  When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an\nuncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable\ncharacter.\n\nThen came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down\nthe long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in\nthe distance.  Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the\nblind, and went up-stairs.  Presently, a light went up-stairs after her,\npassing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase\nwindows, on its way up.  By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind\nwas disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit's eye were there; also the other\ncorner, as if the light porter's eye were on that side.  Still, no\ncommunication was made to Stephen.  Much relieved when the two hours were\nat last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for\nso much loitering.\n\nHe had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie down on his temporary\nbed upon the floor; for his bundle was made up for to-morrow, and all was\narranged for his departure.  He meant to be clear of the town very early;\nbefore the Hands were in the streets.\n\nIt was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his room,\nmournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again, he went out.\nThe town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it,\nrather than hold communication with him.  Everything looked wan at that\nhour.  Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad\nsea.\n\nBy the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his way; by the\nred brick streets; by the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by\nthe railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening\nday; by the railway's crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half\nbuilt up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens\nwere sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by\ncoal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of\nthe hill, and looked back.\n\nDay was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were going\nfor the morning work.  Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high\nchimneys had the sky to themselves.  Puffing out their poisonous volumes,\nthey would not be long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the\nmany windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun\neternally in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.\n\nSo strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.  So strange, to have\nthe road-dust on his feet instead of the coal-grit.  So strange to have\nlived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer\nmorning!  With these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm,\nStephen took his attentive face along the high road.  And the trees\narched over him, whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII\nGUNPOWDER\n\n\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE, \"going in\" for his adopted party, soon began to\nscore.  With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a\nlittle more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a tolerable\nmanagement of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most effective and most\npatronized of the polite deadly sins, he speedily came to be considered\nof much promise.  The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand\npoint in his favour, enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with\nas good a grace as if he had been born one of the tribe, and to throw all\nother tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites.\n\n\"Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and who do not believe\nthemselves.  The only difference between us and the professors of virtue\nor benevolence, or philanthropy   never mind the name   is, that we know it\nis all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never\nsay so.\"\n\nWhy should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?  It was not so\nunlike her father's principles, and her early training, that it need\nstartle her.  Where was the great difference between the two schools,\nwhen each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her with\nno faith in anything else?  What was there in her soul for James\nHarthouse to destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its\nstate of innocence!\n\nIt was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mind   implanted\nthere before her eminently practical father began to form it   a struggling\ndisposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever\nheard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.  With doubts,\nbecause the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.  With\nresentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were\nindeed a whisper of the truth.  Upon a nature long accustomed to\nself-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as\na relief and justification.  Everything being hollow and worthless, she\nhad missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.  What did it matter, she had\nsaid to her father, when he proposed her husband.  What did it matter,\nshe said still.  With a scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What\ndid anything matter   and went on.\n\nTowards what?  Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet\nso gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless.  As to Mr.\nHarthouse, whither _he_ tended, he neither considered nor cared.  He had\nno particular design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled\nhis lassitude.  He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it\nbecame so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have\nbeen consistent with his reputation to confess.  Soon after his arrival\nhe languidly wrote to his brother, the honourable and jocular member,\nthat the Bounderbys were \"great fun;\" and further, that the female\nBounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and\nremarkably pretty.  After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted\nhis leisure chiefly to their house.  He was very often in their house, in\nhis flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much\nencouraged by Mr. Bounderby.  It was quite in Mr. Bounderby's gusty way\nto boast to all his world that _he_ didn't care about your highly\nconnected people, but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind's daughter did, she\nwas welcome to their company.\n\nMr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the\nface which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him.\n\nHe was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did not forget\na word of the brother's revelations.  He interwove them with everything\nhe saw of the sister, and he began to understand her.  To be sure, the\nbetter and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of\nperception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he\nsoon began to read the rest with a student's eye.\n\nMr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen\nmiles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway\nstriding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted\ncoal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary\nengines at pits' mouths.  This country, gradually softening towards the\nneighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby's retreat, there mellowed into a rustic\nlandscape, golden with heath, and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of\nthe year, and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer\ntime.  The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus\npleasantly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his\ndetermination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune,\noverspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds.  These\naccidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of\nCoketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the\nimprovident classes.\n\nIt afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this\nsnug little estate, and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in\nthe flower-garden.  He delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the\nelegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his origin.\n\"Why, sir,\" he would say to a visitor, \"I am told that Nickits,\" the late\nowner, \"gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.  Now, to be plain\nwith you, if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at\nit, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall do.  No, by\nGeorge!  I don't forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  For\nyears upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could\nhave got into my possession, by any means, unless I stole 'em, were the\nengravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles\nthat I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when\nthey were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!\"\n\nThen he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style.\n\n\"Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.  Bring half a dozen\nmore if you like, and we'll find room for 'em.  There's stabling in this\nplace for a dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full\nnumber.  A round dozen of 'em, sir.  When that man was a boy, he went to\nWestminster School.  Went to Westminster School as a King's Scholar, when\nI was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.\nWhy, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses   which I don't, for one's enough\nfor me   I couldn't bear to see 'em in their stalls here, and think what my\nown lodging used to be.  I couldn't look at 'em, sir, and not order 'em\nout.  Yet so things come round.  You see this place; you know what sort\nof a place it is; you are aware that there's not a completer place of its\nsize in this kingdom or elsewhere   I don't care where   and here, got into\nthe middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.  While\nNickits (as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday), Nickits,\nwho used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the\nchief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were\nblack in the face, is drivelling at this minute   drivelling, sir!   in a\nfifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp.\"\n\nIt was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry\nsummer days, that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him\nwondering when he first saw it, and to try if it would change for him.\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you\nalone here.  I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you.\"\n\nIt was not by any wonderful accident that he found her, the time of day\nbeing that at which she was always alone, and the place being her\nfavourite resort.  It was an opening in a dark wood, where some felled\ntrees lay, and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last\nyear, as she had watched the falling ashes at home.\n\nHe sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.\n\n\"Your brother.  My young friend Tom   \"\n\nHer colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of interest.  \"I\nnever in my life,\" he thought, \"saw anything so remarkable and so\ncaptivating as the lighting of those features!\"  His face betrayed his\nthoughts   perhaps without betraying him, for it might have been according\nto its instructions so to do.\n\n\"Pardon me.  The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful   Tom\nshould be so proud of it   I know this is inexcusable, but I am so\ncompelled to admire.\"\n\n\"Being so impulsive,\" she said composedly.\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with you.  You know I am\na sordid piece of human nature, ready to sell myself at any time for any\nreasonable sum, and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"I am waiting,\" she returned, \"for your further reference to my brother.\"\n\n\"You are rigid with me, and I deserve it.  I am as worthless a dog as you\nwill find, except that I am not false   not false.  But you surprised and\nstarted me from my subject, which was your brother.  I have an interest\nin him.\"\n\n\"Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?\" she asked, half\nincredulously and half gratefully.\n\n\"If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.  I\nmust say now   even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of\njustly awakening your incredulity   yes.\"\n\nShe made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak, but could not\nfind voice; at length she said, \"Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for\nbeing interested in my brother.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I claim to deserve it.  You know how little I do claim, but\nI will go that length.  You have done so much for him, you are so fond of\nhim; your whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming\nself-forgetfulness on his account   pardon me again   I am running wide of\nthe subject.  I am interested in him for his own sake.\"\n\nShe had made the slightest action possible, as if she would have risen in\na hurry and gone away.  He had turned the course of what he said at that\ninstant, and she remained.\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby,\" he resumed, in a lighter manner, and yet with a show of\neffort in assuming it, which was even more expressive than the manner he\ndismissed; \"it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your\nbrother's years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive   a little\ndissipated, in the common phrase.  Is he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Allow me to be frank.  Do you think he games at all?\"\n\n\"I think he makes bets.\"  Mr. Harthouse waiting, as if that were not her\nwhole answer, she added, \"I know he does.\"\n\n\"Of course he loses?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Everybody does lose who bets.  May I hint at the probability of your\nsometimes supplying him with money for these purposes?\"\n\nShe sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her eyes searchingly\nand a little resentfully.\n\n\"Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.  I think Tom\nmay be gradually falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a\nhelping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience.   Shall I say\nagain, for his sake?  Is that necessary?\"\n\nShe seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.\n\n\"Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,\" said James\nHarthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more\nairy manner; \"I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many\nadvantages.  Whether   forgive my plainness   whether any great amount of\nconfidence is likely to have been established between himself and his\nmost worthy father.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Louisa, flushing with her own great remembrance in that\nwise, \"think it likely.\"\n\n\"Or, between himself, and   I may trust to your perfect understanding of my\nmeaning, I am sure   and his highly esteemed brother-in-law.\"\n\nShe flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a\nfainter voice, \"I do not think that likely, either.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby,\" said Harthouse, after a short silence, \"may there be a\nbetter confidence between yourself and me?  Tom has borrowed a\nconsiderable sum of you?\"\n\n\"You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,\" she returned, after some\nindecision: she had been more or less uncertain, and troubled throughout\nthe conversation, and yet had in the main preserved her self-contained\nmanner; \"you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know,\nit is not by way of complaint or regret.  I would never complain of\nanything, and what I have done I do not in the least regret.\"\n\n\"So spirited, too!\" thought James Harthouse.\n\n\"When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in\ndebt.  Heavily for him, I mean.  Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some\ntrinkets.  They were no sacrifice.  I sold them very willingly.  I\nattached no value to them.  They, were quite worthless to me.\"\n\nEither she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in her\nconscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her husband's gifts.\nShe stopped, and reddened again.  If he had not known it before, he would\nhave known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was.\n\n\"Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I\ncould spare: in short, what money I have had.  Confiding in you at all,\non the faith of the interest you profess for him, I will not do so by\nhalves.  Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has wanted\nin one sum as much as a hundred pounds.  I have not been able to give it\nto him.  I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so\ninvolved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to\nyour honour.  I have held no confidence with any one, because   you\nanticipated my reason just now.\"  She abruptly broke off.\n\nHe was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity here of\npresenting her own image to her, slightly disguised as her brother.\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, I feel\nthe utmost interest, I assure you, in what you tell me.  I cannot\npossibly be hard upon your brother.  I understand and share the wise\nconsideration with which you regard his errors.  With all possible\nrespect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive\nthat he has not been fortunate in his training.  Bred at a disadvantage\ntowards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes into\nthese extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been\nforced   with the very best intentions we have no doubt   upon him.  Mr.\nBounderby's fine bluff English independence, though a most charming\ncharacteristic, does not   as we have agreed   invite confidence.  If I might\nventure to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that\ndelicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character misconceived, and\nabilities misdirected, would turn for relief and guidance, I should\nexpress what it presents to my own view.\"\n\nAs she sat looking straight before her, across the changing lights upon\nthe grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he saw in her face her\napplication of his very distinctly uttered words.\n\n\"All allowance,\" he continued, \"must be made.  I have one great fault to\nfind with Tom, however, which I cannot forgive, and for which I take him\nheavily to account.\"\n\nLouisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that?\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he returned, \"I have said enough.  Perhaps it would have been\nbetter, on the whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.\"\n\n\"You alarm me, Mr. Harthouse.  Pray let me know it.\"\n\n\"To relieve you from needless apprehension   and as this confidence\nregarding your brother, which I prize I am sure above all possible\nthings, has been established between us   I obey.  I cannot forgive him for\nnot being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his life, of the\naffection of his best friend; of the devotion of his best friend; of her\nunselfishness; of her sacrifice.  The return he makes her, within my\nobservation, is a very poor one.  What she has done for him demands his\nconstant love and gratitude, not his ill-humour and caprice.  Careless\nfellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be\nregardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a\nvenial offence.\"\n\nThe wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused with tears.  They\nrose from a deep well, long concealed, and her heart was filled with\nacute pain that found no relief in them.\n\n\"In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I\nmust aspire.  My better knowledge of his circumstances, and my direction\nand advice in extricating them   rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a\nscapegrace on a much larger scale   will give me some influence over him,\nand all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.  I have said\nenough, and more than enough.  I seem to be protesting that I am a sort\nof good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to\nmake any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am\nnothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees,\" he added, having lifted\nup his eyes and looked about; for he had watched her closely until now;\n\"is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.  As he seems to be\nloitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards\nhim, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been very silent and doleful\nof late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched   if there are such\nthings as consciences.  Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too\noften to believe in them.\"\n\nHe assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet\nthe whelp.  He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he\nstooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick.  He was\nstartled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter\npastime, and his colour changed.\n\n\"Halloa!\" he stammered; \"I didn't know you were here.\"\n\n\"Whose name, Tom,\" said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder\nand turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house\ntogether, \"have you been carving on the trees?\"\n\n\"Whose name?\" returned Tom.  \"Oh!  You mean what girl's name?\"\n\n\"You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature's on\nthe bark, Tom.\"\n\n         [Picture: Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden]\n\n\"Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a\nslashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me.  Or she\nmight be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me.  I'd\ncarve her name as often as she liked.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.\"\n\n\"Mercenary,\" repeated Tom.  \"Who is not mercenary?  Ask my sister.\"\n\n\"Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?\" said Louisa,\nshowing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature.\n\n\"You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,\" returned her brother sulkily.\n\"If it does, you can wear it.\"\n\n\"Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,\"\nsaid Mr. Harthouse.  \"Don't believe him, Mrs. Bounderby.  He knows much\nbetter.  I shall disclose some of his opinions of you, privately\nexpressed to me, unless he relents a little.\"\n\n\"At all events, Mr. Harthouse,\" said Tom, softening in his admiration of\nhis patron, but shaking his head sullenly too, \"you can't tell her that I\never praised her for being mercenary.  I may have praised her for being\nthe contrary, and I should do it again, if I had as good reason.\nHowever, never mind this now; it's not very interesting to you, and I am\nsick of the subject.\"\n\nThey walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her visitor's arm and\nwent in.  He stood looking after her, as she ascended the steps, and\npassed into the shadow of the door; then put his hand upon her brother's\nshoulder again, and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the\ngarden.\n\n\"Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with you.\"\n\nThey had stopped among a disorder of roses   it was part of Mr. Bounderby's\nhumility to keep Nickits's roses on a reduced scale   and Tom sat down on a\nterrace-parapet, plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his\npowerful Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the parapet, and his\nfigure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.  They were just\nvisible from her window.  Perhaps she saw them.\n\n\"Tom, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh!  Mr. Harthouse,\" said Tom with a groan, \"I am hard up, and bothered\nout of my life.\"\n\n\"My good fellow, so am I.\"\n\n\"You!\" returned Tom.  \"You are the picture of independence.  Mr.\nHarthouse, I am in a horrible mess.  You have no idea what a state I have\ngot myself into   what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she\nwould only have done it.\"\n\nHe took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth\nwith a hand that trembled like an infirm old man's.  After one\nexceedingly observant look at him, his companion relapsed into his\nlightest air.\n\n\"Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister.  You\nhave had money of her, you dog, you know you have.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have.  How else was I to get it?  Here's\nold Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a\nmonth, or something of that sort.  Here's my father drawing what he calls\na line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels.  Here's my\nmother who never has anything of her own, except her complaints.  What\n_is_ a fellow to do for money, and where _am_ I to look for it, if not to\nmy sister?\"\n\nHe was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens.  Mr.\nHarthouse took him persuasively by the coat.\n\n\"But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it   \"\n\n\"Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?  I don't say she has got it.  I may have\nwanted more than she was likely to have got.  But then she ought to get\nit.  She could get it.  It's of no use pretending to make a secret of\nmatters now, after what I have told you already; you know she didn't\nmarry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake.\nThen why doesn't she get what I want, out of him, for my sake?  She is\nnot obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough;\nshe could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.  Then why doesn't\nshe choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is?  But no.  There\nshe sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable\nand getting it easily.  I don't know what you may call this, but I call\nit unnatural conduct.\"\n\nThere was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on\nthe other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong\ninclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of\nCoketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.  But he\npreserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone\nbalustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little\nsurface-island.\n\n\"My dear Tom,\" said Harthouse, \"let me try to be your banker.\"\n\n\"For God's sake,\" replied Tom, suddenly, \"don't talk about bankers!\"  And\nvery white he looked, in contrast with the roses.  Very white.\n\nMr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best\nsociety, was not to be surprised   he could as soon have been affected   but\nhe raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble\ntouch of wonder.  Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his\nschool to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind\nCollege.\n\n\"What is the present need, Tom?  Three figures?  Out with them.  Say what\nthey are.\"\n\n\"Mr. Harthouse,\" returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were\nbetter than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \"it's too\nlate; the money is of no use to me at present.  I should have had it\nbefore to be of use to me.  But I am very much obliged to you; you're a\ntrue friend.\"\n\nA true friend!  \"Whelp, whelp!\" thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \"what an\nAss you are!\"\n\n\"And I take your offer as a great kindness,\" said Tom, grasping his hand.\n\"As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned the other, \"it may be of more use by and by.  And, my\ngood fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come\nthick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find\nfor yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds.\n\"I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\"\n\n\"Now, you see, Tom,\" said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing\nover a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always\ndrifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland:\n\"every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the\nrest of my fellow-creatures.  I am desperately intent;\" the languor of\nhis desperation being quite tropical; \"on your softening towards your\nsister   which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and\nagreeable sort of brother   which you ought to be.\"\n\n\"I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\"\n\n\"No time like the present, Tom.  Begin at once.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will.  And my sister Loo shall say so.\"\n\n\"Having made which bargain, Tom,\" said Harthouse, clapping him on the\nshoulder again, with an air which left him at liberty to infer   as he did,\npoor fool   that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good\nnature to lessen his sense of obligation, \"we will tear ourselves asunder\nuntil dinner-time.\"\n\nWhen Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy enough, his\nbody was on the alert; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in.  \"I\ndidn't mean to be cross, Loo,\" he said, giving her his hand, and kissing\nher.  \"I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of you.\"\n\nAfter this, there was a smile upon Louisa's face that day, for some one\nelse.  Alas, for some one else!\n\n\"So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for,\"\nthought James Harthouse, reversing the reflection of his first day's\nknowledge of her pretty face.  \"So much the less, so much the less.\"\n\n\n\n",

I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort.  Yonder, among the trees, is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.  As he seems to be loitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards him, and throw ourselves in his way.  He has been very silent and doleful of late.  Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched   if there are such things as consciences.  Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them."

        "raw text": " VIII\nEXPLOSION\n\n\nTHE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and James Harthouse\nrose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing-room,\nsmoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his\nyoung friend.  Reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his\neastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so\nrich and soft with summer odours, he reckoned up his advantages as an\nidle winner might count his gains.  He was not at all bored for the time,\nand could give his mind to it.\n\nHe had established a confidence with her, from which her husband was\nexcluded.  He had established a confidence with her, that absolutely\nturned upon her indifference towards her husband, and the absence, now\nand at all times, of any congeniality between them.  He had artfully, but\nplainly, assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate\nrecesses; he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment; he\nhad associated himself with that feeling; and the barrier behind which\nshe lived, had melted away.  All very odd, and very satisfactory!\n\nAnd yet he had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of purpose in him.\nPublicly and privately, it were much better for the age in which he\nlived, that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad,\nthan indifferent and purposeless.  It is the drifting icebergs setting\nwith any current anywhere, that wreck the ships.\n\nWhen the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about in a shape\nby which few but savages and hunters are attracted.  But, when he is\ntrimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he is\naweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used\nup as to bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or\nto the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.\n\nSo James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and\nreckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to\nbe travelling.  The end to which it led was before him, pretty plainly;\nbut he troubled himself with no calculations about it.  What will be,\nwill be.\n\nAs he had rather a long ride to take that day   for there was a public\noccasion \"to do\" at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity\nof going in for the Gradgrind men   he dressed early and went down to\nbreakfast.  He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous\nevening.  No.  He resumed where he had left off.  There was a look of\ninterest for him again.\n\nHe got through the day as much (or as little) to his own satisfaction, as\nwas to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding\nback at six o'clock.  There was a sweep of some half-mile between the\nlodge and the house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the\nsmooth gravel, once Nickits's, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the\nshrubbery, with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road.\n\n\"Harthouse!\" cried Mr. Bounderby.  \"Have you heard?\"\n\n\"Heard what?\" said Harthouse, soothing his horse, and inwardly favouring\nMr. Bounderby with no good wishes.\n\n\"Then you _haven't_ heard!\"\n\n\"I have heard you, and so has this brute.  I have heard nothing else.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path\nbefore the horse's head, to explode his bombshell with more effect.\n\n\"The Bank's robbed!\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"Robbed last night, sir.  Robbed in an extraordinary manner.  Robbed with\na false key.\"\n\n\"Of much?\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really seemed\nmortified by being obliged to reply, \"Why, no; not of very much.  But it\nmight have been.\"\n\n\"Of how much?\"\n\n\"Oh! as a sum   if you stick to a sum   of not more than a hundred and fifty\npound,\" said Bounderby, with impatience.  \"But it's not the sum; it's the\nfact.  It's the fact of the Bank being robbed, that's the important\ncircumstance.  I am surprised you don't see it.\"\n\n\"My dear Bounderby,\" said James, dismounting, and giving his bridle to\nhis servant, \"I _do_ see it; and am as overcome as you can possibly\ndesire me to be, by the spectacle afforded to my mental view.\nNevertheless, I may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you   which I do\nwith all my soul, I assure you   on your not having sustained a greater\nloss.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee,\" replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner.  \"But I\ntell you what.  It might have been twenty thousand pound.\"\n\n\"I suppose it might.\"\n\n\"Suppose it might!  By the Lord, you _may_ suppose so.  By George!\" said\nMr. Bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.  \"It\nmight have been twice twenty.  There's no knowing what it would have\nbeen, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the fellows' being\ndisturbed.\"\n\nLouisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit, and Bitzer.\n\n\"Here's Tom Gradgrind's daughter knows pretty well what it might have\nbeen, if you don't,\" blustered Bounderby.  \"Dropped, sir, as if she was\nshot when I told her!  Never knew her do such a thing before.  Does her\ncredit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\"\n\nShe still looked faint and pale.  James Harthouse begged her to take his\narm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been\ncommitted.\n\n\"Why, I am going to tell you,\" said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm\nto Mrs. Sparsit.  \"If you hadn't been so mighty particular about the sum,\nI should have begun to tell you before.  You know this lady (for she _is_\na lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\"\n\n\"I have already had the honour   \"\n\n\"Very well.  And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same\noccasion?\"  Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer\nknuckled his forehead.\n\n\"Very well.  They live at the Bank.  You know they live at the Bank,\nperhaps?  Very well.  Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business\nhours, everything was put away as usual.  In the iron room that this\nyoung fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.  In the\nlittle safe in young Tom's closet, the safe used for petty purposes,\nthere was a hundred and fifty odd pound.\"\n\n\"A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,\" said Bitzer.\n\n\"Come!\" retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, \"let's have\nnone of _your_ interruptions.  It's enough to be robbed while you're\nsnoring because you're too comfortable, without being put right with\n_your_ four seven ones.  I didn't snore, myself, when I was your age, let\nme tell you.  I hadn't victuals enough to snore.  And I didn't four seven\none.  Not if I knew it.\"\n\nBitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at\nonce particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of\nMr. Bounderby's moral abstinence.\n\n\"A hundred and fifty odd pound,\" resumed Mr. Bounderby.  \"That sum of\nmoney, young Tom locked in his safe, not a very strong safe, but that's\nno matter now.  Everything was left, all right.  Some time in the night,\nwhile this young fellow snored   Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, you say you have\nheard him snore?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"I cannot say that I have heard him\nprecisely snore, and therefore must not make that statement.  But on\nwinter evenings, when he has fallen asleep at his table, I have heard\nhim, what I should prefer to describe as partially choke.  I have heard\nhim on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be\nsometimes heard in Dutch clocks.  Not,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty\nsense of giving strict evidence, \"that I would convey any imputation on\nhis moral character.  Far from it.  I have always considered Bitzer a\nyoung man of the most upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my\ntestimony.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said the exasperated Bounderby, \"while he was snoring, _or_\nchoking, _or_ Dutch-clocking, _or_ something _or_ other   being asleep   some\nfellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not\nremains to be seen, got to young Tom's safe, forced it, and abstracted\nthe contents.  Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves\nout at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked,\nand the key under Mrs. Sparsit's pillow) with a false key, which was\npicked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve o'clock to-day.  No\nalarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and\nbegins to open and prepare the offices for business.  Then, looking at\nTom's safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the\nmoney gone.\"\n\n\"Where is Tom, by the by?\" asked Harthouse, glancing round.\n\n\"He has been helping the police,\" said Bounderby, \"and stays behind at\nthe Bank.  I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his\ntime of life.  They would have been out of pocket if they had invested\neighteenpence in the job; I can tell 'em that.\"\n\n\"Is anybody suspected?\"\n\n\"Suspected?  I should think there was somebody suspected.  Egod!\" said\nBounderby, relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit's arm to wipe his heated head.\n\"Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody\nsuspected.  No, thank you!\"\n\nMight Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected?\n\n\"Well,\" said Bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all,\n\"I'll tell you.  It's not to be mentioned everywhere; it's not to be\nmentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (there's a\ngang of 'em) may be thrown off their guard.  So take this in confidence.\nNow wait a bit.\"  Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again.  \"What should you\nsay to;\" here he violently exploded: \"to a Hand being in it?\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Harthouse, lazily, \"not our friend Blackpot?\"\n\n\"Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,\" returned Bounderby, \"and that's the man.\"\n\nLouisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise.\n\n\"O yes!  I know!\" said Bounderby, immediately catching at the sound.  \"I\nknow!  I am used to that.  I know all about it.  They are the finest\npeople in the world, these fellows are.  They have got the gift of the\ngab, they have.  They only want to have their rights explained to them,\nthey do.  But I tell you what.  Show me a dissatisfied Hand, and I'll\nshow you a man that's fit for anything bad, I don't care what it is.\"\n\nAnother of the popular fictions of Coketown, which some pains had been\ntaken to disseminate   and which some people really believed.\n\n\"But I am acquainted with these chaps,\" said Bounderby.  \"I can read 'em\noff, like books.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I appeal to you.  What warning did\nI give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the\nexpress object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over,\nand floor the Established Church?  Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high\nconnexions, you are on a level with the aristocracy,   did I say, or did I\nnot say, to that fellow, \"you can't hide the truth from me: you are not\nthe kind of fellow I like; you'll come to no good\"?\"\n\n\"Assuredly, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"you did, in a highly impressive\nmanner, give him such an admonition.\"\n\n\"When he shocked you, ma'am,\" said Bounderby; \"when he shocked your\nfeelings?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek shake of her head, \"he\ncertainly did so.  Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may\nbe weaker on such points   more foolish if the term is preferred   than they\nmight have been, if I had always occupied my present position.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as\nto say, \"I am the proprietor of this female, and she's worth your\nattention, I think.\"  Then, resumed his discourse.\n\n\"You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw\nhim.  I didn't mince the matter with him.  I am never mealy with 'em.  I\nKNOW 'em.  Very well, sir.  Three days after that, he bolted.  Went off,\nnobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy   only with this\ndifference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible.  What\ndid he do before he went?  What do you say;\" Mr. Bounderby, with his hat\nin his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his\nsentences, as if it were a tambourine; \"to his being seen   night after\nnight   watching the Bank?   to his lurking about there   after dark?   To its\nstriking Mrs. Sparsit   that he could be lurking for no good   To her calling\nBitzer's attention to him, and their both taking notice of him   And to its\nappearing on inquiry to-day   that he was also noticed by the neighbours?\"\nHaving come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put\nhis tambourine on his head.\n\n\"Suspicious,\" said James Harthouse, \"certainly.\"\n\n\"I think so, sir,\" said Bounderby, with a defiant nod.  \"I think so.  But\nthere are more of 'em in it.  There's an old woman.  One never hears of\nthese things till the mischief's done; all sorts of defects are found out\nin the stable door after the horse is stolen; there's an old woman turns\nup now.  An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a\nbroomstick, every now and then.  _She_ watches the place a whole day\nbefore this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals\naway with him and holds a council with him   I suppose, to make her report\non going off duty, and be damned to her.\"\n\nThere was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from\nobservation, thought Louisa.\n\n\"This is not all of 'em, even as we already know 'em,\" said Bounderby,\nwith many nods of hidden meaning.  \"But I have said enough for the\npresent.  You'll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no\none.  It may take time, but we shall have 'em.  It's policy to give 'em\nline enough, and there's no objection to that.\"\n\n\"Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as\nnotice-boards observe,\" replied James Harthouse, \"and serve them right.\nFellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences.  If there were no\nconsequences, we should all go in for Banks.\"  He had gently taken\nLouisa's parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked\nunder its shade, though the sun did not shine there.\n\n\"For the present, Loo Bounderby,\" said her husband, \"here's Mrs. Sparsit\nto look after.  Mrs. Sparsit's nerves have been acted upon by this\nbusiness, and she'll stay here a day or two.  So make her comfortable.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir,\" that discreet lady observed, \"but pray do not\nlet My comfort be a consideration.  Anything will do for Me.\"\n\nIt soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association\nwith that domestic establishment, it was that she was so excessively\nregardless of herself and regardful of others, as to be a nuisance.  On\nbeing shown her chamber, she was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts\nas to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the\nnight on the mangle in the laundry.  True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses\nwere accustomed to splendour, \"but it is my duty to remember,\" Mrs.\nSparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace: particularly when any\nof the domestics were present, \"that what I was, I am no longer.\nIndeed,\" said she, \"if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr.\nSparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family;\nor if I could even revoke the fact, and make myself a person of common\ndescent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do so.  I should think\nit, under existing circumstances, right to do so.\"  The same Hermitical\nstate of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner,\nuntil fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she said,\n\"Indeed you are very good, sir;\" and departed from a resolution of which\nshe had made rather formal and public announcement, to \"wait for the\nsimple mutton.\"  She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt;\nand, feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest\nextent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves, occasionally sat back\nin her chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large\ndimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed (or rather, must\nbe, for it insisted on public notice) sliding down her Roman nose.\n\nBut Mrs. Sparsit's greatest point, first and last, was her determination\nto pity Mr. Bounderby.  There were occasions when in looking at him she\nwas involuntarily moved to shake her head, as who would say, \"Alas, poor\nYorick!\"  After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of\nemotion, she would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully\ncheerful, and would say, \"You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful\nto find;\" and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr.\nBounderby bore up as he did.  One idiosyncrasy for which she often\napologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.  She had a\ncurious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby \"Miss Gradgrind,\" and yielded\nto it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.  Her\nrepetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion;\nbut indeed, she said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind:\nwhereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the\nhappiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs.\nBounderby, she found almost impossible.  It was a further singularity of\nthis remarkable case, that the more she thought about it, the more\nimpossible it appeared; \"the differences,\" she observed, \"being such.\"\n\nIn the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the\nrobbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the\nsuspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of\nthe law.  That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to\nrecommend Tom to come home by the mail-train.\n\nWhen candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, \"Don't be low, sir.\nPray let me see you cheerful, sir, as I used to do.\"  Mr. Bounderby, upon\nwhom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him, in\na bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large\nsea-animal.  \"I cannot bear to see you so, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"Try\na hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of\nliving under your roof.\"  \"I haven't played backgammon, ma'am,\" said Mr.\nBounderby, \"since that time.\"  \"No, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly,\n\"I am aware that you have not.  I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no\ninterest in the game.  But I shall be happy, sir, if you will\ncondescend.\"\n\nThey played near a window, opening on the garden.  It was a fine night:\nnot moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.  Louisa and Mr. Harthouse\nstrolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the\nstillness, though not what they said.  Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at\nthe backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the\nshadows without.  \"What's the matter, ma'am?\" said Mr. Bounderby; \"you\ndon't see a Fire, do you?\"  \"Oh dear no, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"I\nwas thinking of the dew.\"  \"What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?\"\nsaid Mr. Bounderby.  \"It's not myself, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"I am\nfearful of Miss Gradgrind's taking cold.\"  \"She never takes cold,\" said\nMr. Bounderby.  \"Really, sir?\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  And was affected with\na cough in her throat.\n\nWhen the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of\nwater.  \"Oh, sir?\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"Not your sherry warm, with\nlemon-peel and nutmeg?\"  \"Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it\nnow, ma'am,\" said Mr. Bounderby.  \"The more's the pity, sir,\" returned\nMrs. Sparsit; \"you are losing all your good old habits.  Cheer up, sir!\nIf Miss Gradgrind will permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I\nhave often done.\"\n\nMiss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she\npleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed it to Mr.\nBounderby.  \"It will do you good, sir.  It will warm your heart.  It is\nthe sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.\"  And when Mr.\nBounderby said, \"Your health, ma'am!\" she answered with great feeling,\n\"Thank you, sir.  The same to you, and happiness also.\"  Finally, she\nwished him good night, with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed,\nwith a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender,\nthough he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.\n\nLong after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for\nher brother's coming home.  That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour\npast midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm\nthe trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.  At last, when the\ndarkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she\nheard the bell at the gate.  She felt as though she would have been glad\nthat it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its\nlast sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead\nagain.\n\nShe waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.  Then she arose,\nput on a loose robe, and went out of her room in the dark, and up the\nstaircase to her brother's room.  His door being shut, she softly opened\nit and spoke to him, approaching his bed with a noiseless step.\n\nShe kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over his neck, and drew his\nface to hers.  She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said\nnothing to him.\n\nHe started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that\nwas, and what was the matter?\n\n\"Tom, have you anything to tell me?  If ever you loved me in your life,\nand have anything concealed from every one besides, tell it to me.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, Loo.  You have been dreaming.\"\n\n\"My dear brother:\" she laid her head down on his pillow, and her hair\nflowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself: \"is\nthere nothing that you have to tell me?  Is there nothing you can tell me\nif you will?  You can tell me nothing that will change me.  O Tom, tell\nme the truth!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, Loo!\"\n\n\"As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy night, so you must lie\nsomewhere one night, when even I, if I am living then, shall have left\nyou.  As I am here beside you, barefoot, unclothed, undistinguishable in\ndarkness, so must I lie through all the night of my decay, until I am\ndust.  In the name of that time, Tom, tell me the truth now!\"\n\n\"What is it you want to know?\"\n\n\"You may be certain;\" in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom\nas if he were a child; \"that I will not reproach you.  You may be certain\nthat I will be compassionate and true to you.  You may be certain that I\nwill save you at whatever cost.  O Tom, have you nothing to tell me?\nWhisper very softly.  Say only \"yes,\" and I shall understand you!\"\n\nShe turned her ear to his lips, but he remained doggedly silent.\n\n\"Not a word, Tom?\"\n\n\"How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I don't know what you mean?\nLoo, you are a brave, kind girl, worthy I begin to think of a better\nbrother than I am.  But I have nothing more to say.  Go to bed, go to\nbed.\"\n\n\"You are tired,\" she whispered presently, more in her usual way.\n\n\"Yes, I am quite tired out.\"\n\n\"You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.  Have any fresh\ndiscoveries been made?\"\n\n\"Only those you have heard of, from   him.\"\n\n\"Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and\nthat we saw those three together?\"\n\n\"No.  Didn't you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you\nasked me to go there with you?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But I did not know then what was going to happen.\"\n\n\"Nor I neither.  How could I?\"\n\nHe was very quick upon her with this retort.\n\n\"Ought I to say, after what has happened,\" said his sister, standing by\nthe bed   she had gradually withdrawn herself and risen, \"that I made that\nvisit?  Should I say so?  Must I say so?\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, Loo,\" returned her brother, \"you are not in the habit of\nasking my advice.  Say what you like.  If you keep it to yourself, I\nshall keep it to _my_self.  If you disclose it, there's an end of it.\"\n\nIt was too dark for either to see the other's face; but each seemed very\nattentive, and to consider before speaking.\n\n\"Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in\nthis crime?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I don't see why he shouldn't be.\"\n\n\"He seemed to me an honest man.\"\n\n\"Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet not be so.\"  There was\na pause, for he had hesitated and stopped.\n\n\"In short,\" resumed Tom, as if he had made up his mind, \"if you come to\nthat, perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his favour, that I\ntook him outside the door to tell him quietly, that I thought he might\nconsider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from\nmy sister, and that I hoped he would make good use of it.  You remember\nwhether I took him out or not.  I say nothing against the man; he may be\na very good fellow, for anything I know; I hope he is.\"\n\n\"Was he offended by what you said?\"\n\n\"No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough.  Where are you, Loo?\"\nHe sat up in bed and kissed her.  \"Good night, my dear, good night.\"\n\n\"You have nothing more to tell me?\"\n\n\"No.  What should I have?  You wouldn't have me tell you a lie!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have you do that to-night, Tom, of all the nights in your\nlife; many and much happier as I hope they will be.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear Loo.  I am so tired, that I am sure I wonder I don't\nsay anything to get to sleep.  Go to bed, go to bed.\"\n\nKissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet over his head, and\nlay as still as if that time had come by which she had adjured him.  She\nstood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away.  She\nstopped at the door, looked back when she had opened it, and asked him if\nhe had called her?  But he lay still, and she softly closed the door and\nreturned to her room.\n\nThen the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone, crept out\nof bed, fastened his door, and threw himself upon his pillow again:\ntearing his hair, morosely crying, grudgingly loving her, hatefully but\nimpenitently spurning himself, and no less hatefully and unprofitably\nspurning all the good in the world.\n\n\n\n",

Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I appeal to you.  What warning did I give that fellow, the first time he set foot in the house, when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over, and floor the Established Church?

        "raw text": " IX\nHEARING THE LAST OF IT\n\n\nMRS. SPARSIT, lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr.\nBounderby's retreat, kept such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her\nCoriolanian eyebrows, that her eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an\niron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold\nrock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood,\nbut for the placidity of her manner.  Although it was hard to believe\nthat her retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so severely\nwide awake were those classical eyes of hers, and so impossible did it\nseem that her rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence, yet her\nmanner of sitting, smoothing her uncomfortable, not to say, gritty\nmittens (they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe), or of\nambling to unknown places of destination with her foot in her cotton\nstirrup, was so perfectly serene, that most observers would have been\nconstrained to suppose her a dove, embodied by some freak of nature, in\nthe earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.\n\nShe was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.  How she got\nfrom story to story was a mystery beyond solution.  A lady so decorous in\nherself, and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of dropping\nover the banisters or sliding down them, yet her extraordinary facility\nof locomotion suggested the wild idea.  Another noticeable circumstance\nin Mrs. Sparsit was, that she was never hurried.  She would shoot with\nconsummate velocity from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full\npossession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there.\nNeither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.\n\nShe took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation\nwith him soon after her arrival.  She made him her stately curtsey in the\ngarden, one morning before breakfast.\n\n\"It appears but yesterday, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"that I had the\nhonour of receiving you at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to\nbe made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby's address.\"\n\n\"An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of\nAges,\" said Mr. Harthouse, inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the\nmost indolent of all possible airs.\n\n\"We live in a singular world, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have\nmade a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically\nexpressed.\"\n\n\"A singular world, I would say, sir,\" pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after\nacknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not\naltogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet\ntones; \"as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals\nwe were quite ignorant of, at another.  I recall, sir, that on that\noccasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss\nGradgrind.\"\n\n\"Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves.  I\navailed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is\nunnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate.  Mrs. Sparsit's\ntalent for   in fact for anything requiring accuracy   with a combination of\nstrength of mind   and Family   is too habitually developed to admit of any\nquestion.\"  He was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took\nhim so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course\nof its execution.\n\n\"You found Miss Gradgrind   I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it's\nvery absurd of me   as youthful as I described her?\" asked Mrs. Sparsit,\nsweetly.\n\n\"You drew her portrait perfectly,\" said Mr. Harthouse.  \"Presented her\ndead image.\"\n\n\"Very engaging, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to\nrevolve over one another.\n\n\"Highly so.\"\n\n\"It used to be considered,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"that Miss Gradgrind was\nwanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and\nstrikingly improved in that respect.  Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr.\nBounderby!\" cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as\nif she had been talking and thinking of no one else.  \"How do you find\nyourself this morning, sir?  Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\"\n\nNow, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his\nload, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby\nsofter than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most\nother people from his wife downward.  So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with\nforced lightness of heart, \"You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say\nMiss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\" Mr. Bounderby\nreplied, \"If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma'am, I believe\nyou know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I'll trouble _you_\nto take charge of the teapot.\"  Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her\nold position at table.\n\nThis again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.  She was so\nhumble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never\ncould think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often\nas she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby's breakfast, before\nMrs. Gradgrind   she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby   she\nhoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though\nshe trusted to become familiar with it by and by   had assumed her present\nposition.  It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to\nbe a little late, and Mr. Bounderby's time was so very precious, and she\nknew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,\nthat she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his\nwill had been a law to her.\n\n\"There!  Stop where you are, ma'am,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"stop where you\nare!  Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity,\n\"because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby.  And to be unkind is not\nto be you, sir.\"\n\n\"You may set your mind at rest, ma'am.   You can take it very quietly,\ncan't you, Loo?\" said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.\n\n\"Of course.  It is of no moment.  Why should it be of any importance to\nme?\"\n\n\"Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?\"\nsaid Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.  \"You attach too\nmuch importance to these things, ma'am.  By George, you'll be corrupted\nin some of your notions here.  You are old-fashioned, ma'am.  You are\nbehind Tom Gradgrind's children's time.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked Louisa, coldly surprised.  \"What has\ngiven you offence?\"\n\n\"Offence!\" repeated Bounderby.  \"Do you suppose if there was any offence\ngiven me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected?  I am a\nstraightforward man, I believe.  I don't go beating about for\nside-winds.\"\n\n\"I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too\ndelicate,\" Louisa answered him composedly: \"I have never made that\nobjection to you, either as a child or as a woman.  I don't understand\nwhat you would have.\"\n\n\"Have?\" returned Mr. Bounderby.  \"Nothing.  Otherwise, don't you, Loo\nBounderby, know thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,\nwould have it?\"\n\nShe looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with\na proud colour in her face that was a new change, Mr. Harthouse thought.\n\"You are incomprehensible this morning,\" said Louisa.  \"Pray take no\nfurther trouble to explain yourself.  I am not curious to know your\nmeaning.  What does it matter?\"\n\nNothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay\non indifferent subjects.  But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr.\nBounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and\nstrengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence\nagainst him with another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine\nthat she could not retrace them if she tried.  But whether she ever tried\nor no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.\n\nMrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that,\nassisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast, and being then alone\nwith him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand, murmured\n\"My benefactor!\" and retired, overwhelmed with grief.  Yet it is an\nindubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five\nminutes after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same\ndescendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers,\nshook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a contemptuous grimace\nat that work of art, and said \"Serve you right, you Noodle, and I am glad\nof it.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer appeared.  Bitzer had\ncome down by train, shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches\nthat bestrode the wild country of past and present coal-pits, with an\nexpress from Stone Lodge.  It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs.\nGradgrind lay very ill.  She had never been well within her daughter's\nknowledge; but, she had declined within the last few days, had continued\nsinking all through the night, and was now as nearly dead, as her limited\ncapacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to\nget out of it, allowed.\n\nAccompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at\nDeath's door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked, Louisa rumbled to Coketown,\nover the coal-pits past and present, and was whirled into its smoky jaws.\nShe dismissed the messenger to his own devices, and rode away to her old\nhome.\n\nShe had seldom been there since her marriage.  Her father was usually\nsifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap in London (without\nbeing observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish), and\nwas still hard at it in the national dust-yard.  Her mother had taken it\nrather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined\nupon her sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy she\nhad never softened to again, since the night when the stroller's child\nhad raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby's intended wife.  She had no\ninducements to go back, and had rarely gone.\n\nNeither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the best\ninfluences of old home descend upon her.  The dreams of childhood   its\nairy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of\nthe world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to be\nremembered when outgrown, for then the least among them rises to the\nstature of a great Charity in the heart, suffering little children to\ncome into the midst of it, and to keep with their pure hands a garden in\nthe stony ways of this world, wherein it were better for all the children\nof Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and\nnot worldly-wise   what had she to do with these?  Remembrances of how she\nhad journeyed to the little that she knew, by the enchanted roads of what\nshe and millions of innocent creatures had hoped and imagined; of how,\nfirst coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy, she had seen\nit a beneficent god, deferring to gods as great as itself; not a grim\nIdol, cruel and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and its big\ndumb shape set up with a sightless stare, never to be moved by anything\nbut so many calculated tons of leverage   what had she to do with these?\nHer remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up\nof every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out.  The\ngolden waters were not there.  They were flowing for the fertilization of\nthe land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles.\n\nShe went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house\nand into her mother's room.  Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy\nhad lived with the rest of the family on equal terms.  Sissy was at her\nmother's side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in\nthe room.\n\nThere was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind\nthat her eldest child was there.  She reclined, propped up, from mere\nhabit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so\nhelpless could be kept in.  She had positively refused to take to her\nbed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it.\n\nHer feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the\nsound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in\ngetting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of\na well.  The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had\nmuch to do with it.\n\nOn being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at\ncross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he\nmarried Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had\ncalled him J; and that she could not at present depart from that\nregulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.  Louisa\nhad sat by her for some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she\narrived at a clear understanding who it was.  She then seemed to come to\nit all at once.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, \"and I hope you are going on\nsatisfactorily to yourself.  It was all your father's doing.  He set his\nheart upon it.  And he ought to know.\"\n\n\"I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.\"\n\n\"You want to hear of me, my dear?  That's something new, I am sure, when\nanybody wants to hear of me.  Not at all well, Louisa.  Very faint and\ngiddy.\"\n\n\"Are you in pain, dear mother?\"\n\n\"I think there's a pain somewhere in the room,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind, \"but\nI couldn't positively say that I have got it.\"\n\nAfter this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.  Louisa, holding\nher hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin\nthread of life in fluttering motion.\n\n\"You very seldom see your sister,\" said Mrs. Gradgrind.  \"She grows like\nyou.  I wish you would look at her.  Sissy, bring her here.\"\n\nShe was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister's.  Louisa had\nobserved her with her arm round Sissy's neck, and she felt the difference\nof this approach.\n\n\"Do you see the likeness, Louisa?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother.  I should think her like me.  But   \"\n\n\"Eh!  Yes, I always say so,\" Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected\nquickness.  \"And that reminds me.  I   I want to speak to you, my dear.\nSissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.\" Louisa had relinquished\nthe hand: had thought that her sister's was a better and brighter face\nthan hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of\nresentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the\ngentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the\ntrusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich\ndark hair.\n\nLeft alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon\nher face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all\nresistance over, content to be carried down the stream.  She put the\nshadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.\n\n\"You were going to speak to me, mother.\"\n\n\"Eh?  Yes, to be sure, my dear.  You know your father is almost always\naway now, and therefore I must write to him about it.\"\n\n\"About what, mother?  Don't be troubled.  About what?\"\n\n\"You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any\nsubject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have\nlong left off saying anything.\"\n\n\"I can hear you, mother.\"  But, it was only by dint of bending down to\nher ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they\nmoved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of\nconnexion.\n\n\"You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother.  Ologies of\nall kinds from morning to night.  If there is any Ology left, of any\ndescription, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say\nis, I hope I shall never hear its name.\"\n\n\"I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.\"  This, to keep\nher from floating away.\n\n\"But there is something   not an Ology at all   that your father has missed,\nor forgotten, Louisa.  I don't know what it is.  I have often sat with\nSissy near me, and thought about it.  I shall never get its name now.\nBut your father may.  It makes me restless.  I want to write to him, to\nfind out for God's sake, what it is.  Give me a pen, give me a pen.\"\n\nEven the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor head, which\ncould just turn from side to side.\n\nShe fancied, however, that her request had been complied with, and that\nthe pen she could not have held was in her hand.  It matters little what\nfigures of wonderful no-meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers.\nThe hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that had always\nbeen feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs.\nGradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth\nhimself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and\npatriarchs.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " X\nMRS. SPARSIT'S STAIRCASE\n\n\nMRS. SPARSIT'S nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman\nmade a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby's retreat, where,\nnotwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming\nconsciousness of her altered station, she resigned herself with noble\nfortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on the fat\nof the land.  During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship\nof the Bank, Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to\ntake such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face, as is rarely taken on man,\nand to call his portrait a Noodle to _its_ face, with the greatest\nacrimony and contempt.\n\nMr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs.\nSparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general\ncross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was),\nand further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor\nif it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything\nhe chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.  So\nwhen her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming\nsweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day\nbefore her departure, \"I tell you what, ma'am; you shall come down here\nof a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\"  To\nwhich Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan\npersuasion: \"To hear is to obey.\"\n\nNow, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the\nnature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.  Much watching of Louisa,\nand much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which\nkeenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit's edge, must have given her as\nit were a lift, in the way of inspiration.  She erected in her mind a\nmighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and\ndown those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa\ncoming.\n\nIt became the business of Mrs. Sparsit's life, to look up at her\nstaircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.  Sometimes slowly, sometimes\nquickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never\nturning back.  If she had once turned back, it might have been the death\nof Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.\n\nShe had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr.\nBounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.  Mrs. Sparsit was\nin good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.\n\n\"And pray, sir,\" said she, \"if I may venture to ask a question\nappertaining to any subject on which you show reserve   which is indeed\nhardy in me, for I well know you have a reason for everything you do   have\nyou received intelligence respecting the robbery?\"\n\n\"Why, ma'am, no; not yet.  Under the circumstances, I didn't expect it\nyet.  Rome wasn't built in a day, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Very true, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head.\n\n\"Nor yet in a week, ma'am.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon\nher.\n\n\"In a similar manner, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"I can wait, you know.  If\nRomulus and Remus could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait.  They were\nbetter off in their youth than I was, however.  They had a she-wolf for a\nnurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother.  She didn't give any\nmilk, ma'am; she gave bruises.  She was a regular Alderney at that.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" continued Bounderby, \"I have not heard anything more about\nit.  It's in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business\nat present   something new for him; he hadn't the schooling _I_ had   is\nhelping.  My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over.\nDo what you like under the rose, but don't give a sign of what you're\nabout; or half a hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fellow\nwho has bolted, out of reach for good.  Keep it quiet, and the thieves\nwill grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have 'em.\"\n\n\"Very sagacious indeed, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"Very interesting.  The\nold woman you mentioned, sir   \"\n\n\"The old woman I mentioned, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, cutting the matter\nshort, as it was nothing to boast about, \"is not laid hold of; but, she\nmay take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her\nvillainous old mind.  In the mean time, ma'am, I am of opinion, if you\nask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.\"\n\nThe same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her\npacking operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa\nstill descending.\n\nShe sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low;\nhe stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face\nalmost touched her hair.  \"If not quite!\" said Mrs. Sparsit, straining\nher hawk's eyes to the utmost.  Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a\nword of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly,\notherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said\nwas this:\n\n\"You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?\"\n\n\"Oh, perfectly!\"\n\n\"His face, and his manner, and what he said?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.  And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.\nLengthy and prosy in the extreme.  It was knowing to hold forth, in the\nhumble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the\ntime, \"My good fellow, you are over-doing this!\"\"\n\n\"It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.\"\n\n\"My dear Louisa   as Tom says.\"  Which he never did say.  \"You know no good\nof the fellow?\"\n\n\"No, certainly.\"\n\n\"Nor of any other such person?\"\n\n\"How can I,\" she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he\nhad lately seen, \"when I know nothing of them, men or women?\"\n\n\"My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of\nyour devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his\nexcellent fellow-creatures   for excellent they are, I am quite ready to\nbelieve, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to\nwhat they can get hold of.  This fellow talks.  Well; every fellow talks.\nHe professes morality.  Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality.\nFrom the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general\nprofession of morality, except among our people; it really is that\nexception which makes our people quite reviving.  You saw and heard the\ncase.  Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my\nesteemed friend Mr. Bounderby   who, as we know, is not possessed of that\ndelicacy which would soften so tight a hand.  The member of the fluffy\nclasses was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody\nwho proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went\nin, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and\nrelieved his mind extremely.  Really he would have been an uncommon,\ninstead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an\nopportunity.  Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the\ncleverness.\"\n\n\"I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,\" returned Louisa, after\nsitting thoughtful awhile, \"to be so ready to agree with you, and to be\nso lightened in my heart by what you say.\"\n\n\"I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.  I have talked it over\nwith my friend Tom more than once   of course I remain on terms of perfect\nconfidence with Tom   and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his.\nWill you walk?\"\n\nThey strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the\ntwilight   she leaning on his arm   and she little thought how she was going\ndown, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.\n\nNight and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.  When Louisa had arrived at\nthe bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it\nwould; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs.\nSparsit's eyes.  And there Louisa always was, upon it.\n\nAnd always gliding down, down, down!\n\nMrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and\nthere; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked\nto a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept\nher black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of\ncompunction, all absorbed in interest.  In the interest of seeing her,\never drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom\nof this new Giant's Staircase.\n\nWith all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his\nportrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the\ndescent.  Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for\nthe last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her\nhopes.  Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and\nseldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at\nthe figure coming down.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " XI\nLOWER AND LOWER\n\n\nTHE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always\nverging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.\n\nMr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife's decease, made an expedition from\nLondon, and buried her in a business-like manner.  He then returned with\npromptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the\nodds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes\nof other people who wanted other odds and ends   in fact resumed his\nparliamentary duties.\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.  Separated\nfrom her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing\nCoketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like\nobservation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through\nJames Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through\neverything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.\n\"Your foot on the last step, my lady,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing\nthe descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, \"and all\nyour art shall never blind me.\"\n\nArt or nature though, the original stock of Louisa's character or the\ngraft of circumstances upon it,   her curious reserve did baffle, while it\nstimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit.  There were times when Mr.\nJames Harthouse was not sure of her.  There were times when he could not\nread the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a\ngreater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of\nsatellites to help her.\n\nSo the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away\nfrom home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or\nfour days.  It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at\nthe Bank, adding: \"But you'll go down to-morrow, ma'am, all the same.\nYou'll go down just as if I was there.  It will make no difference to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, \"let me beg you not to\nsay that.  Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I\nthink you very well know.\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,\"\nsaid Mr. Bounderby, not displeased.\n\n\"Mr. Bounderby,\" retorted Mrs. Sparsit, \"your will is to me a law, sir;\notherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not\nfeeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to\nreceive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.  But you\nshall say no more, sir.  I will go, upon your invitation.\"\n\n\"Why, when I invite you to my house, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, opening his\neyes, \"I should hope you want no other invitation.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"I should hope not.  Say no\nmore, sir.  I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, ma'am?\" blustered Bounderby.\n\n\"Sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \"there was wont to be an elasticity in you\nwhich I sadly miss.  Be buoyant, sir!\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed\nup by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and\nridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being\nheard to bully the small fry of business all the morning.\n\n\"Bitzer,\" said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on\nhis journey, and the Bank was closing, \"present my compliments to young\nMr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop\nand walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\"  Young Mr. Thomas being\nusually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and\nfollowed on its heels.  \"Mr. Thomas,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"these plain\nviands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\" said the whelp.  And gloomily fell to.\n\n\"How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\" asked Mrs. Sparsit.\n\n\"Oh, he's all right,\" said Tom.\n\n\"Where may he be at present?\" Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light\nconversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies\nfor being so uncommunicative.\n\n\"He is shooting in Yorkshire,\" said Tom.  \"Sent Loo a basket half as big\nas a church, yesterday.\"\n\n\"The kind of gentleman, now,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \"whom one might\nwager to be a good shot!\"\n\n\"Crack,\" said Tom.\n\nHe had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had\nso increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three\nseconds together.  Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching\nhis looks, if she were so inclined.\n\n\"Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"as\nindeed he is of most people.  May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr.\nTom?\"\n\n\"Why, _I_ expect to see him to-morrow,\" returned the whelp.\n\n\"Good news!\" cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly.\n\n\"I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the\nstation here,\" said Tom, \"and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I\nbelieve.  He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so,\nbeing due somewhere else.  At least, he says so; but I shouldn't wonder\nif he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.\"\n\n\"Which reminds me!\" said Mrs. Sparsit.  \"Would you remember a message to\nyour sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?\"\n\n\"Well?  I'll try,\" returned the reluctant whelp, \"if it isn't a long un.\"\n\n\"It is merely my respectful compliments,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"and I fear\nI may not trouble her with my society this week; being still a little\nnervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.\"\n\n\"Oh!  If that's all,\" observed Tom, \"it wouldn't much matter, even if I\nwas to forget it, for Loo's not likely to think of you unless she sees\nyou.\"\n\nHaving paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment, he\nrelapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more India ale left,\nwhen he said, \"Well, Mrs. Sparsit, I must be off!\" and went off.\n\nNext day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day long looking\nat the customers coming in and out, watching the postmen, keeping an eye\non the general traffic of the street, revolving many things in her mind,\nbut, above all, keeping her attention on her staircase.  The evening\ncome, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her\nreasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a\npassenger would arrive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it\nround pillars and corners, and out of ladies' waiting-room windows, to\nappearing in its precincts openly.\n\nTom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected train came\nin.  It brought no Mr. Harthouse.  Tom waited until the crowd had\ndispersed, and the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of\ntrains, and took counsel with porters.  That done, he strolled away idly,\nstopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat\noff and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and\nexhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who\nhad still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty\nminutes hence.\n\n\"This is a device to keep him out of the way,\" said Mrs. Sparsit,\nstarting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last.\n\"Harthouse is with his sister now!\"\n\nIt was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off with her\nutmost swiftness to work it out.  The station for the country house was\nat the opposite end of the town, the time was short, the road not easy;\nbut she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick in\ndarting out of it, producing her money, seizing her ticket, and diving\ninto the train, that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of\ncoal-pits past and present, as if she had been caught up in a cloud and\nwhirled away.\n\nAll the journey, immovable in the air though never left behind; plain to\nthe dark eyes of her mind, as the electric wires which ruled a colossal\nstrip of music-paper out of the evening sky, were plain to the dark eyes\nof her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase, with the figure coming down.\nVery near the bottom now.  Upon the brink of the abyss.\n\nAn overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its\ndrooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the\nwooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a\ngreen lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.\nOne or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily\ncrossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick\ndust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she\nvery softly closed a gate.\n\nShe went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round\nit, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.  Most of them were\nopen, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights\nyet, and all was silent.  She tried the garden with no better effect.\nShe thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and\nbriers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.\nWith her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her, Mrs.\nSparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth, so intent\nupon her object that she probably would have done no less, if the wood\nhad been a wood of adders.\n\nHark!\n\nThe smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests, fascinated by\nthe glittering of Mrs. Sparsit's eyes in the gloom, as she stopped and\nlistened.\n\nLow voices close at hand.  His voice and hers.  The appointment _was_ a\ndevice to keep the brother away!  There they were yonder, by the felled\ntree.\n\nBending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them.\nShe drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his\nambuscade against the savages; so near to them that at a spring, and that\nno great one, she could have touched them both.  He was there secretly,\nand had not shown himself at the house.  He had come on horseback, and\nmust have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was tied\nto the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces.\n\n\"My dearest love,\" said he, \"what could I do?  Knowing you were alone,\nwas it possible that I could stay away?\"\n\n\"You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; _I_ don't\nknow what they see in you when you hold it up,\" thought Mrs. Sparsit;\n\"but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!\"\n\nThat she hung her head, was certain.  She urged him to go away, she\ncommanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor\nraised it.  Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the\namiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life.\nHer hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her\nmanner of speaking was not hurried.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his\narm embraced her; \"will you not bear with my society for a little while?\"\n\n\"Not here.\"\n\n\"Where, Louisa?\"\n\n\"Not here.\"\n\n\"But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far,\nand am altogether so devoted, and distracted.  There never was a slave at\nonce so devoted and ill-used by his mistress.  To look for your sunny\nwelcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen\nmanner, is heart-rending.\"\n\n\"Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?\"\n\n\"But we must meet, my dear Louisa.  Where shall we meet?\"\n\nThey both started.  The listener started, guiltily, too; for she thought\nthere was another listener among the trees.  It was only rain, beginning\nto fall fast, in heavy drops.\n\n\"Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence, innocently supposing\nthat its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though I am the most\nunfortunate fellow in the world, I believe, to have been insensible to\nall other women, and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of\nthe most beautiful, and the most engaging, and the most imperious.  My\ndearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of\nyour power.\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him\nthen and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit's) greedy hearing, tell her how\nhe loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to\nplay away all that he had in life.  The objects he had lately pursued,\nturned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he\nflung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her.  Its\npursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation if it\ntook him from her, or flight if she shared it, or secrecy if she\ncommanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that\nshe was true to him,   the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she\nhad inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of\nwhich he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her\nconfidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.  All this, and more,\nin his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified malice, in\nthe dread of being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy\nrain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling up   Mrs. Sparsit\nreceived into her mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of\nconfusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence\nand led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or\nwhen, except that they had said it was to be that night.\n\nBut one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she\ntracked that one she must be right.  \"Oh, my dearest love,\" thought Mrs.\nSparsit, \"you little think how well attended you are!\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house.  What\nto do next?  It rained now, in a sheet of water.  Mrs. Sparsit's white\nstockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were\nin her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own\nmaking, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and\nher Roman nose.  In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the\ndensity of the shrubbery, considering what next?\n\nLo, Louisa coming out of the house!  Hastily cloaked and muffled, and\nstealing away.  She elopes!  She falls from the lowermost stair, and is\nswallowed up in the gulf.\n\nIndifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she\nstruck into a side-path parallel with the ride.  Mrs. Sparsit followed in\nthe shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to\nkeep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.\n\nWhen she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit\nstopped.  When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on.  She went by the way\nMrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony\nroad, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.  A train for\nCoketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she\nunderstood Coketown to be her first place of destination.\n\nIn Mrs. Sparsit's limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were\nnecessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee\nof the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on\nover her bonnet.  So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when\nshe followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small\noffice.  Louisa sat waiting in a corner.  Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in\nanother corner.  Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the\nrain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the\narches.  Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw\nthe lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron\ntracks.\n\nThe seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening\nto a complaint of the heart, announced the train.  Fire and steam, and\nsmoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put\ninto one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a\ndesert speck in the thunderstorm.\n\nThough her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, Mrs. Sparsit\nexulted hugely.  The figure had plunged down the precipice, and she felt\nherself, as it were, attending on the body.  Could she, who had been so\nactive in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?\n\"She will be at Coketown long before him,\" thought Mrs. Sparsit, \"though\nhis horse is never so good.  Where will she wait for him?  And where will\nthey go together?  Patience.  We shall see.\"\n\nThe tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped\nat its destination.  Gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed,\nand streets were under water.  In the first instant of alighting, Mrs.\nSparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which\nwere in great request.  \"She will get into one,\" she considered, \"and\nwill be away before I can follow in another.  At all risks of being run\nover, I must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.\"\n\nBut, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.  Louisa got into no\ncoach, and was already gone.  The black eyes kept upon the\nrailroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment\ntoo late.  The door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit\npassed it and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.\nWet through and through: with her feet squelching and squashing in her\nshoes whenever she moved; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage;\nwith a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes spoiled; with\ndamp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she wore,\nprinted off upon her highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on\nher general exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a\nmouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of\nbitterness and say, \"I have lost her!\"\n\n\n\n",

The noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it\nattracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head\nsometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements.  When it\nthundered very loudly, he glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind\nthat some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.\n\nThe thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like\na deluge, when the door of his room opened.  He looked round the lamp\nupon his table, and saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter.\n\n\"Louisa!\"\n\n\"Father, I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?  How strange you look!  And good Heaven,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind, wondering more and more, \"have you come here exposed to this\nstorm?\"\n\nShe put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.  \"Yes.\"  Then she\nuncovered her head, and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might,\nstood looking at him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and\ndespairing, that he was afraid of her.\n\n\"What is it?  I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what is the matter.\"\n\nShe dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on his arm.\n\n\"Father, you have trained me from my cradle?\"\n\n\"Yes, Louisa.\"\n\n\"I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.\"\n\nHe looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: \"Curse the hour?\nCurse the hour?\"\n\n\"How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable\nthings that raise it from the state of conscious death?  Where are the\ngraces of my soul?  Where are the sentiments of my heart?  What have you\ndone, O father, what have you done, with the garden that should have\nbloomed once, in this great wilderness here!\"\n\nShe struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom.\n\n\"If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me from the void in\nwhich my whole life sinks.  I did not mean to say this; but, father, you\nremember the last time we conversed in this room?\"\n\nHe had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that it was with\ndifficulty he answered, \"Yes, Louisa.\"\n\n\"What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my lips then, if you\nhad given me a moment's help.  I don't reproach you, father.  What you\nhave never nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but O! if\nyou had only done so long ago, or if you had only neglected me, what a\nmuch better and much happier creature I should have been this day!\"\n\nOn hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head upon his hand and\ngroaned aloud.\n\n\"Father, if you had known, when we were last together here, what even I\nfeared while I strove against it   as it has been my task from infancy to\nstrive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart; if\nyou had known that there lingered in my breast, sensibilities,\naffections, weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength, defying\nall the calculations ever made by man, and no more known to his\narithmetic than his Creator is,   would you have given me to the husband\nwhom I am now sure that I hate?\"\n\nHe said, \"No.  No, my poor child.\"\n\n\"Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have\nhardened and spoiled me?  Would you have robbed me   for no one's\nenrichment   only for the greater desolation of this world   of the\nimmaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge\nfrom what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in\nwhich I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with\nthem, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?\"\n\n\"O no, no.  No, Louisa.\"\n\n\"Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped my way by my\nsense of touch, and had been free, while I knew the shapes and surfaces\nof things, to exercise my fancy somewhat, in regard to them; I should\nhave been a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more contented,\nmore innocent and human in all good respects, than I am with the eyes I\nhave.  Now, hear what I have come to say.\"\n\nHe moved, to support her with his arm.  She rising as he did so, they\nstood close together: she, with a hand upon his shoulder, looking fixedly\nin his face.\n\n\"With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have never been for a\nmoment appeased; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules,\nand figures, and definitions were not quite absolute; I have grown up,\nbattling every inch of my way.\"\n\n\"I never knew you were unhappy, my child.\"\n\n\"Father, I always knew it.  In this strife I have almost repulsed and\ncrushed my better angel into a demon.  What I have learned has left me\ndoubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what I have not learned;\nand my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and\nthat nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.\"\n\n\"And you so young, Louisa!\" he said with pity.\n\n\"And I so young.  In this condition, father   for I show you now, without\nfear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it   you\nproposed my husband to me.  I took him.  I never made a pretence to him\nor you that I loved him.  I knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew,\nthat I never did.  I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of\nbeing pleasant and useful to Tom.  I made that wild escape into something\nvisionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was.  But Tom had been\nthe subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so\nbecause I knew so well how to pity him.  It matters little now, except as\nit may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors.\"\n\nAs her father held her in his arms, she put her other hand upon his other\nshoulder, and still looking fixedly in his face, went on.\n\n\"When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into rebellion against the\ntie, the old strife, made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which\narise out of our two individual natures, and which no general laws shall\never rule or state for me, father, until they shall be able to direct the\nanatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul.\"\n\n\"Louisa!\" he said, and said imploringly; for he well remembered what had\npassed between them in their former interview.\n\n\"I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint.  I am here with\nanother object.\"\n\n\"What can I do, child?  Ask me what you will.\"\n\n\"I am coming to it.  Father, chance then threw into my way a new\nacquaintance; a man such as I had had no experience of; used to the\nworld; light, polished, easy; making no pretences; avowing the low\nestimate of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret;\nconveying to me almost immediately, though I don't know how or by what\ndegrees, that he understood me, and read my thoughts.  I could not find\nthat he was worse than I.  There seemed to be a near affinity between us.\nI only wondered it should be worth his while, who cared for nothing else,\nto care so much for me.\"\n\n\"For you, Louisa!\"\n\nHer father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but that he felt\nher strength departing from her, and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes\nsteadfastly regarding him.\n\n\"I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence.  It matters very\nlittle how he gained it.  Father, he did gain it.  What you know of the\nstory of my marriage, he soon knew, just as well.\"\n\nHer father's face was ashy white, and he held her in both his arms.\n\n\"I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.  But if you ask me\nwhether I have loved him, or do love him, I tell you plainly, father,\nthat it may be so.  I don't know.\"\n\nShe took her hands suddenly from his shoulders, and pressed them both\nupon her side; while in her face, not like itself   and in her figure,\ndrawn up, resolute to finish by a last effort what she had to say   the\nfeelings long suppressed broke loose.\n\n\"This night, my husband being away, he has been with me, declaring\nhimself my lover.  This minute he expects me, for I could release myself\nof his presence by no other means.  I do not know that I am sorry, I do\nnot know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I am degraded in my own\nesteem.  All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not\nsave me.  Now, father, you have brought me to this.  Save me by some\nother means!\"\n\nHe tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor, but\nshe cried out in a terrible voice, \"I shall die if you hold me!  Let me\nfall upon the ground!\"  And he laid her down there, and saw the pride of\nhis heart and the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible heap, at\nhis feet.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                          END OF THE SECOND BOOK\n\n_GARNERING_\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " I\nANOTHER THING NEEDFUL\n\n\nLOUISA awoke from a torpor, and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed\nat home, and her old room.  It seemed, at first, as if all that had\nhappened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the\nshadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more real to her\nsight, the events became more real to her mind.\n\nShe could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her eyes were\nstrained and sore, and she was very weak.  A curious passive inattention\nhad such possession of her, that the presence of her little sister in the\nroom did not attract her notice for some time.  Even when their eyes had\nmet, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes\nlooking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive\nhand, before she asked:\n\n\"When was I brought to this room?\"\n\n\"Last night, Louisa.\"\n\n\"Who brought me here?\"\n\n\"Sissy, I believe.\"\n\n\"Why do you believe so?\"\n\n\"Because I found her here this morning.  She didn't come to my bedside to\nwake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her.  She was not in\nher own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until\nI found her here taking care of you and cooling your head.  Will you see\nfather? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.\"\n\n\"What a beaming face you have, Jane!\" said Louisa, as her young\nsister   timidly still   bent down to kiss her.\n\n\"Have I?  I am very glad you think so.  I am sure it must be Sissy's\ndoing.\"\n\nThe arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself.  \"You\ncan tell father if you will.\"  Then, staying her for a moment, she said,\n\"It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of\nwelcome?\"\n\n\"Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.  It was   \"\n\nLouisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.  When her sister had\nwithdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards\nthe door, until it opened and her father entered.\n\nHe had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady,\ntrembled in hers.  He sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking\nhow she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet\nafter her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.  He spoke in\na subdued and troubled voice, very different from his usual dictatorial\nmanner; and was often at a loss for words.\n\n\"My dear Louisa.  My poor daughter.\"  He was so much at a loss at that\nplace, that he stopped altogether.  He tried again.\n\n\"My unfortunate child.\"  The place was so difficult to get over, that he\ntried again.\n\n\"It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how\noverwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.\nThe ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.  The\nonly support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and\nstill does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.  I\nam stunned by these discoveries.  I have no selfish meaning in what I\nsay; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very\nheavy indeed.\"\n\nShe could give him no comfort herein.  She had suffered the wreck of her\nwhole life upon the rock.\n\n\"I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived\nme some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your\npeace, and better for mine.  For I am sensible that it may not have been\na part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.  I had proved\nmy   my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it; and I must\nbear the responsibility of its failures.  I only entreat you to believe,\nmy favourite child, that I have meant to do right.\"\n\nHe said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.  In gauging\nfathomless deeps with his little mean excise-rod, and in staggering over\nthe universe with his rusty stiff-legged compasses, he had meant to do\ngreat things.  Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled\nabout, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of\npurpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept.\n\n\"I am well assured of what you say, father.  I know I have been your\nfavourite child.  I know you have intended to make me happy.  I have\nnever blamed you, and I never shall.\"\n\nHe took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.\n\n\"My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pondering again and\nagain on what has so painfully passed between us.  When I consider your\ncharacter; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours, has\nbeen concealed by you for years; when I consider under what immediate\npressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion\nthat I cannot but mistrust myself.\"\n\nHe might have added more than all, when he saw the face now looking at\nhim.  He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her scattered\nhair from her forehead with his hand.  Such little actions, slight in\nanother man, were very noticeable in him; and his daughter received them\nas if they had been words of contrition.\n\n\"But,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a\nwretched sense of happiness, \"if I see reason to mistrust myself for the\npast, Louisa, I should also mistrust myself for the present and the\nfuture.  To speak unreservedly to you, I do.  I am far from feeling\nconvinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time\nyesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how\nto respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have\nthe right instinct   supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that\nnature   how to help you, and to set you right, my child.\"\n\nShe had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so\nthat he could not see it.  All her wildness and passion had subsided;\nbut, though softened, she was not in tears.  Her father was changed in\nnothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her\nin tears.\n\n\"Some persons hold,\" he pursued, still hesitating, \"that there is a\nwisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart.  I have not\nsupposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now.  I have supposed\nthe head to be all-sufficient.  It may not be all-sufficient; how can I\nventure this morning to say it is!  If that other kind of wisdom should\nbe what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted,\nLouisa   \"\n\nHe suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it\neven now.  She made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still\nhalf-dressed, much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last\nnight.\n\n\"Louisa,\" and his hand rested on her hair again, \"I have been absent from\nhere, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sister's training has\nbeen pursued according to   the system,\" he appeared to come to that word\nwith great reluctance always, \"it has necessarily been modified by daily\nassociations begun, in her case, at an early age.  I ask you   ignorantly\nand humbly, my daughter   for the better, do you think?\"\n\n\"Father,\" she replied, without stirring, \"if any harmony has been\nawakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to\ndiscord, let her thank Heaven for it, and go upon her happier way, taking\nit as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.\"\n\n\"O my child, my child!\" he said, in a forlorn manner, \"I am an unhappy\nman to see you thus!  What avails it to me that you do not reproach me,\nif I so bitterly reproach myself!\"  He bent his head, and spoke low to\nher.  \"Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly\nworking about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the\nHead had left undone and could not do, the Heart may have been doing\nsilently.  Can it be so?\"\n\nShe made him no reply.\n\n\"I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.  How could I be arrogant, and\nyou before me!  Can it be so?  Is it so, my dear?\"  He looked upon her\nonce more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of\nthe room.  He had not been long gone, when she heard a light tread near\nthe door, and knew that some one stood beside her.\n\nShe did not raise her head.  A dull anger that she should be seen in her\ndistress, and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come\nto this fulfilment, smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire.  All\nclosely imprisoned forces rend and destroy.  The air that would be\nhealthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that\nwould ripen it, tear it when caged up.  So in her bosom even now; the\nstrongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a\nheap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.\n\nIt was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood\nherself to be supposed to have fallen asleep.  The sympathetic hand did\nnot claim her resentment.  Let it lie there, let it lie.\n\nIt lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she\nrested.  As she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being\nso watched, some tears made their way into her eyes.  The face touched\nhers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause\nof them.\n\nAs Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that\nshe stood placidly near the bedside.\n\n\"I hope I have not disturbed you.  I have come to ask if you would let me\nstay with you?\"\n\n\"Why should you stay with me?  My sister will miss you.  You are\neverything to her.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" returned Sissy, shaking her head.  \"I would be something to you,\nif I might.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Louisa, almost sternly.\n\n\"Whatever you want most, if I could be that.  At all events, I would like\nto try to be as near it as I can.  And however far off that may be, I\nwill never tire of trying.  Will you let me?\"\n\n\"My father sent you to ask me.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" replied Sissy.  \"He told me that I might come in now, but he\nsent me away from the room this morning   or at least   \"\n\nShe hesitated and stopped.\n\n\"At least, what?\" said Louisa, with her searching eyes upon her.\n\n\"I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very\nuncertain whether you would like to find me here.\"\n\n\"Have I always hated you so much?\"\n\n\"I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you\nshould know it.  But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left\nhome.  Not that I wondered at it.  You knew so much, and I knew so\nlittle, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other\nfriends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.\"\n\nHer colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.  Louisa understood\nthe loving pretence, and her heart smote her.\n\n\"May I try?\" said Sissy, emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that\nwas insensibly drooping towards her.\n\nLouisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another\nmoment, held it in one of hers, and answered:\n\n\"First, Sissy, do you know what I am?  I am so proud and so hardened, so\nconfused and troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to\nmyself, that everything is stormy, dark, and wicked to me.  Does not that\nrepel you?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid\nwaste, that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of\nbeing as learned as you think me, had to begin to acquire the simplest\ntruths, I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour, all the\ngood of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly than I do.  Does not that\nrepel you?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nIn the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up of her old\ndevoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon\nthe darkness of the other.\n\nLouisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow\nthere.  She fell upon her knees, and clinging to this stroller's child\nlooked up at her almost with veneration.\n\n\"Forgive me, pity me, help me!  Have compassion on my great need, and let\nme lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!\"\n\n\"O lay it here!\" cried Sissy.  \"Lay it here, my dear.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " II\nVERY RIDICULOUS\n\n\nMR. JAMES HARTHOUSE passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much\nhurry, that the World, with its best glass in his eye, would scarcely\nhave recognized him during that insane interval, as the brother Jem of\nthe honourable and jocular member.  He was positively agitated.  He\nseveral times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.  He\nwent in and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an\nobject.  He rode like a highwayman.  In a word, he was so horribly bored\nby existing circumstances, that he forgot to go in for boredom in the\nmanner prescribed by the authorities.\n\nAfter putting his horse at Coketown through the storm, as if it were a\nleap, he waited up all night: from time to time ringing his bell with the\ngreatest fury, charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in\nwithholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been\nentrusted to him, and demanding restitution on the spot.  The dawn\ncoming, the morning coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor\nletter coming with either, he went down to the country house.  There, the\nreport was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town.  Left for\ntown suddenly last evening.  Not even known to be gone until receipt of\nmessage, importing that her return was not to be expected for the\npresent.\n\nIn these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town.\nHe went to the house in town.  Mrs. Bounderby not there.  He looked in at\nthe Bank.  Mr. Bounderby away and Mrs. Sparsit away.  Mrs. Sparsit away?\nWho could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that\ngriffin!\n\n\"Well!  I don't know,\" said Tom, who had his own reasons for being uneasy\nabout it.  \"She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning.  She's always\nfull of mystery; I hate her.  So I do that white chap; he's always got\nhis blinking eyes upon a fellow.\"\n\n\"Where were you last night, Tom?\"\n\n\"Where was I last night!\" said Tom.  \"Come!  I like that.  I was waiting\nfor you, Mr. Harthouse, till it came down as _I_ never saw it come down\nbefore.  Where was I too!  Where were you, you mean.\"\n\n\"I was prevented from coming   detained.\"\n\n\"Detained!\" murmured Tom.  \"Two of us were detained.  I was detained\nlooking for you, till I lost every train but the mail.  It would have\nbeen a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night, and have to walk\nhome through a pond.  I was obliged to sleep in town after all.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Where?  Why, in my own bed at Bounderby's.\"\n\n\"Did you see your sister?\"\n\n\"How the deuce,\" returned Tom, staring, \"could I see my sister when she\nwas fifteen miles off?\"\n\nCursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true\na friend, Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the\nsmallest conceivable amount of ceremony, and debated for the hundredth\ntime what all this could mean?  He made only one thing clear.  It was,\nthat whether she was in town or out of town, whether he had been\npremature with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had lost\ncourage, or they were discovered, or some mischance or mistake, at\npresent incomprehensible, had occurred, he must remain to confront his\nfortune, whatever it was.  The hotel where he was known to live when\ncondemned to that region of blackness, was the stake to which he was\ntied.  As to all the rest   What will be, will be.\n\n\"So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a\npenitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby\nin the Lancashire manner   which would seem as likely as anything else in\nthe present state of affairs   I'll dine,\" said Mr. James Harthouse.\n\"Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a\nBritish nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in\ntraining.\"\n\nTherefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa,\nordered \"Some dinner at six   with a beefsteak in it,\" and got through the\nintervening time as well as he could.  That was not particularly well;\nfor he remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on,\nand no kind of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at\ncompound interest.\n\nHowever, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do, and\nentertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than\nonce.  \"It wouldn't be bad,\" he yawned at one time, \"to give the waiter\nfive shillings, and throw him.\"  At another time it occurred to him, \"Or\na fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour.\"\nBut these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his\nsuspense; and, sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.\n\nIt was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in\nthe pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the\ndoor for footsteps, and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps\napproached that room.  But, after dinner, when the day turned to\ntwilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication\nwas made to him, it began to be as he expressed it, \"like the Holy Office\nand slow torture.\"  However, still true to his conviction that\nindifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction he had),\nhe seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a\nnewspaper.\n\nHe had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper,\nwhen the waiter appeared and said, at once mysteriously and\napologetically:\n\n\"Beg your pardon, sir.  You're wanted, sir, if you please.\"\n\nA general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to\nthe swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with\nbristling indignation, what the Devil he meant by \"wanted'?\n\n\"Beg your pardon, sir.  Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.\"\n\n\"Outside?  Where?\"\n\n\"Outside this door, sir.\"\n\nGiving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly\nqualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery.\nA young woman whom he had never seen stood there.  Plainly dressed, very\nquiet, very pretty.  As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair\nfor her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even\nprettier than he had at first believed.  Her face was innocent and\nyouthful, and its expression remarkably pleasant.  She was not afraid of\nhim, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely\npreoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that\nconsideration for herself.\n\n\"I speak to Mr. Harthouse?\" she said, when they were alone.\n\n\"To Mr. Harthouse.\"  He added in his mind, \"And you speak to him with the\nmost confiding eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so\nquiet) I ever heard.\"\n\n\"If I do not understand   and I do not, sir'   said Sissy, \"what your honour\nas a gentleman binds you to, in other matters:\" the blood really rose in\nhis face as she began in these words: \"I am sure I may rely upon it to\nkeep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am going to say.  I will\nrely upon it, if you will tell me I may so far trust   \"\n\n\"You may, I assure you.\"\n\n\"I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see.  In coming to you, sir,\nI have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope.\"  He thought, \"But\nthat is very strong,\" as he followed the momentary upward glance of her\neyes.  He thought besides, \"This is a very odd beginning.  I don't see\nwhere we are going.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sissy, \"you have already guessed whom I left just now!\"\n\n\"I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last\nfour-and-twenty hours (which have appeared as many years),\" he returned,\n\"on a lady's account.  The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you\ncome from that lady, do not deceive me, I trust.\"\n\n\"I left her within an hour.\"\n\n\"At   !\"\n\n\"At her father's.\"\n\nMr. Harthouse's face lengthened in spite of his coolness, and his\nperplexity increased.  \"Then I certainly,\" he thought, \"do _not_ see\nwhere we are going.\"\n\n\"She hurried there last night.  She arrived there in great agitation, and\nwas insensible all through the night.  I live at her father's, and was\nwith her.  You may be sure, sir, you will never see her again as long as\nyou live.\"\n\nMr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man found himself in the\nposition of not knowing what to say, made the discovery beyond all\nquestion that he was so circumstanced.  The child-like ingenuousness with\nwhich his visitor spoke, her modest fearlessness, her truthfulness which\nput all artifice aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her\nearnest quiet holding to the object with which she had come; all this,\ntogether with her reliance on his easily given promise   which in itself\nshamed him   presented something in which he was so inexperienced, and\nagainst which he knew any of his usual weapons would fall so powerless;\nthat not a word could he rally to his relief.\n\nAt last he said:\n\n\"So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and by such lips, is\nreally disconcerting in the last degree.  May I be permitted to inquire,\nif you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless\nwords, by the lady of whom we speak?\"\n\n\"I have no charge from her.\"\n\n\"The drowning man catches at the straw.  With no disrespect for your\njudgment, and with no doubt of your sincerity, excuse my saying that I\ncling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to\nperpetual exile from that lady's presence.\"\n\n\"There is not the least hope.  The first object of my coming here, sir,\nis to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your\never speaking with her again, than there would be if she had died when\nshe came home last night.\"\n\n\"Must believe?  But if I can't   or if I should, by infirmity of nature, be\nobstinate   and won't   \"\n\n\"It is still true.  There is no hope.\"\n\nJames Harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon his lips;\nbut her mind looked over and beyond him, and the smile was quite thrown\naway.\n\nHe bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.\n\n\"Well!  If it should unhappily appear,\" he said, \"after due pains and\nduty on my part, that I am brought to a position so desolate as this\nbanishment, I shall not become the lady's persecutor.  But you said you\nhad no commission from her?\"\n\n\"I have only the commission of my love for her, and her love for me.  I\nhave no other trust, than that I have been with her since she came home,\nand that she has given me her confidence.  I have no further trust, than\nthat I know something of her character and her marriage.  O Mr.\nHarthouse, I think you had that trust too!\"\n\nHe was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been   in that\nnest of addled eggs, where the birds of heaven would have lived if they\nhad not been whistled away   by the fervour of this reproach.\n\n\"I am not a moral sort of fellow,\" he said, \"and I never make any\npretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow.  I am as immoral\nas need be.  At the same time, in bringing any distress upon the lady who\nis the subject of the present conversation, or in unfortunately\ncompromising her in any way, or in committing myself by any expression of\nsentiments towards her, not perfectly reconcilable with   in fact with   the\ndomestic hearth; or in taking any advantage of her father's being a\nmachine, or of her brother's being a whelp, or of her husband's being a\nbear; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no particularly\nevil intentions, but have glided on from one step to another with a\nsmoothness so perfectly diabolical, that I had not the slightest idea the\ncatalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over.  Whereas I\nfind,\" said Mr. James Harthouse, in conclusion, \"that it is really in\nseveral volumes.\"\n\nThough he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed, for that\nonce, a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface.  He was silent for a\nmoment; and then proceeded with a more self-possessed air, though with\ntraces of vexation and disappointment that would not be polished out.\n\n\"After what has been just now represented to me, in a manner I find it\nimpossible to doubt   I know of hardly any other source from which I could\nhave accepted it so readily   I feel bound to say to you, in whom the\nconfidence you have mentioned has been reposed, that I cannot refuse to\ncontemplate the possibility (however unexpected) of my seeing the lady no\nmore.  I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this   and   and, I\ncannot say,\" he added, rather hard up for a general peroration, \"that I\nhave any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow, or\nthat I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever.\"\n\nSissy's face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished.\n\n\"You spoke,\" he resumed, as she raised her eyes to him again, \"of your\nfirst object.  I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you oblige me by confiding it?\"\n\n\"Mr. Harthouse,\" returned Sissy, with a blending of gentleness and\nsteadiness that quite defeated him, and with a simple confidence in his\nbeing bound to do what she required, that held him at a singular\ndisadvantage, \"the only reparation that remains with you, is to leave\nhere immediately and finally.  I am quite sure that you can mitigate in\nno other way the wrong and harm you have done.  I am quite sure that it\nis the only compensation you have left it in your power to make.  I do\nnot say that it is much, or that it is enough; but it is something, and\nit is necessary.  Therefore, though without any other authority than I\nhave given you, and even without the knowledge of any other person than\nyourself and myself, I ask you to depart from this place to-night, under\nan obligation never to return to it.\"\n\nIf she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain faith in the\ntruth and right of what she said; if she had concealed the least doubt or\nirresolution, or had harboured for the best purpose any reserve or\npretence; if she had shown, or felt, the lightest trace of any\nsensitiveness to his ridicule or his astonishment, or any remonstrance he\nmight offer; he would have carried it against her at this point.  But he\ncould as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as\naffect her.\n\n\"But do you know,\" he asked, quite at a loss, \"the extent of what you\nask?  You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of\nbusiness, preposterous enough in itself, but which I have gone in for,\nand sworn by, and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate\nmanner?  You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it's the\nfact.\"\n\nIt had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.\n\n\"Besides which,\" said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn or two across the\nroom, dubiously, \"it's so alarmingly absurd.  It would make a man so\nridiculous, after going in for these fellows, to back out in such an\nincomprehensible way.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure,\" repeated Sissy, \"that it is the only reparation in\nyour power, sir.  I am quite sure, or I would not have come here.\"\n\nHe glanced at her face, and walked about again.  \"Upon my soul, I don't\nknow what to say.  So immensely absurd!\"\n\nIt fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.\n\n\"If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,\" he said, stopping again\npresently, and leaning against the chimney-piece, \"it could only be in\nthe most inviolable confidence.\"\n\n\"I will trust to you, sir,\" returned Sissy, \"and you will trust to me.\"\n\nHis leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the night with the\nwhelp.  It was the self-same chimney-piece, and somehow he felt as if\n_he_ were the whelp to-night.  He could make no way at all.\n\n\"I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position,\" he\nsaid, after looking down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and\nwalking off, and walking back again.  \"But I see no way out of it.  What\nwill be, will be.  _This_ will be, I suppose.  I must take off myself, I\nimagine   in short, I engage to do it.\"\n\nSissy rose.  She was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in\nit, and her face beamed brightly.\n\n\"You will permit me to say,\" continued Mr. James Harthouse, \"that I doubt\nif any other ambassador, or ambassadress, could have addressed me with\nthe same success.  I must not only regard myself as being in a very\nridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.  Will you\nallow me the privilege of remembering my enemy's name?\"\n\n\"_My_ name?\" said the ambassadress.\n\n\"The only name I could possibly care to know, to-night.\"\n\n\"Sissy Jupe.\"\n\n\"Pardon my curiosity at parting.  Related to the family?\"\n\n\"I am only a poor girl,\" returned Sissy.  \"I was separated from my\nfather   he was only a stroller   and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind.  I have\nlived in the house ever since.\"\n\nShe was gone.\n\n\"It wanted this to complete the defeat,\" said Mr. James Harthouse,\nsinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a\nlittle while.  \"The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished.\nOnly a poor girl   only a stroller   only James Harthouse made nothing\nof   only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.\"\n\nThe Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile.  He took a pen\nupon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate\nhieroglyphics) to his brother:\n\n    Dear Jack,   All up at Coketown.  Bored out of the place, and going in\n    for camels.\n\n                                                           Affectionately,\n                                                                      JEM.\n\nHe rang the bell.\n\n\"Send my fellow here.\"\n\n\"Gone to bed, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell him to get up, and pack up.\"\n\nHe wrote two more notes.  One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his\nretirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be\nfound for the next fortnight.  The other, similar in effect, to Mr.\nGradgrind.  Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions,\nhe had left the tall chimneys of Coketown behind, and was in a railway\ncarriage, tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.\n\nThe moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived\nsome comfortable reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one\nof his few actions that made any amends for anything, and as a token to\nhimself that he had escaped the climax of a very bad business.  But it\nwas not so, at all.  A secret sense of having failed and been\nridiculous   a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of\nthings, would say at his expense if they knew it   so oppressed him, that\nwhat was about the very best passage in his life was the one of all\nothers he would not have owned to on any account, and the only one that\nmade him ashamed of himself.\n\n\n\n",

Having executed\nher mission with infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted\naway on Mr. Bounderby's coat-collar.\n\nMr. Bounderby's first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave\nher to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the\nfloor.  He next had recourse to the administration of potent\nrestoratives, such as screwing the patient's thumbs, smiting her hands,\nabundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth.  When\nthese attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled\nher into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried\nher back to Coketown more dead than alive.\n\nRegarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle\non her arrival at her journey's end; but considered in any other light,\nthe amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and\nimpaired her claims to admiration.  Utterly heedless of the wear and tear\nof her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr.\nBounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone\nLodge.\n\n\"Now, Tom Gradgrind,\" said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law's\nroom late at night; \"here's a lady here   Mrs. Sparsit   you know Mrs.\nSparsit   who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\"\n\n\"You have missed my letter!\" exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the\napparition.\n\n\"Missed your letter, sir!\" bawled Bounderby.  \"The present time is no\ntime for letters.  No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown\nabout letters, with his mind in the state it's in now.\"\n\n\"Bounderby,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \"I\nspeak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to\nLouisa.\"\n\n\"Tom Gradgrind,\" replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several\ntimes with great vehemence on the table, \"I speak of a very special\nmessenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.  Mrs. Sparsit,\nma'am, stand forward!\"\n\nThat unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any\nvoice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became\nso aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that Mr.\nBounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.\n\n\"If you can't get it out, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"leave _me_ to get it\nout.  This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be\ntotally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.  Tom Gradgrind, Mrs.\nSparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a\nconversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious\ngentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"Ah!  Indeed!\" cried Bounderby.  \"And in that conversation   \"\n\n\"It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby.  I know what\npassed.\"\n\n\"You do?  Perhaps,\" said Bounderby, staring with all his might at his so\nquiet and assuasive father-in-law, \"you know where your daughter is at\nthe present time!\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.  She is here.\"\n\n\"Here?\"\n\n\"My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on\nall accounts.  Louisa is here.  The moment she could detach herself from\nthat interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply\nregret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here,\nfor protection.  I myself had not been at home many hours, when I\nreceived her   here, in this room.  She hurried by the train to town, she\nran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented\nherself before me in a state of distraction.  Of course, she has remained\nhere ever since.  Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to\nbe more quiet.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every\ndirection except Mrs. Sparsit's direction; and then, abruptly turning\nupon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman:\n\n\"Now, ma'am!  We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think\nproper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no\nother luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" whispered Mrs. Sparsit, \"my nerves are at present too much shaken,\nand my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit\nof my doing more than taking refuge in tears.\"  (Which she did.)\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"without making any observation to you\nthat may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I\nhave got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it\nappears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.  And the coach in\nwhich we came here being at the door, you'll allow me to hand you down to\nit, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to\npursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and\ntake a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.\"  With\nthese words, Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady,\nand escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive\nsneezes by the way.  He soon returned alone.\n\n\"Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to\nspeak to me,\" he resumed, \"here I am.  But, I am not in a very agreeable\nstate, I tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is,\nand not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively\ntreated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be\ntreated by his wife.  You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine,\nI know.  If you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against\nthis candid remark, you had better let it alone.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby\ntook particular pains to harden himself at all points.  It was his\namiable nature.\n\n\"My dear Bounderby,\" Mr. Gradgrind began in reply.\n\n\"Now, you'll excuse me,\" said Bounderby, \"but I don't want to be too\ndear.  That, to start with.  When I begin to be dear to a man, I\ngenerally find that his intention is to come over me.  I am not speaking\nto you politely; but, as you are aware, I am _not_ polite.  If you like\npoliteness, you know where to get it.  You have your gentleman-friends,\nyou know, and they'll serve you with as much of the article as you want.\nI don't keep it myself.\"\n\n\"Bounderby,\" urged Mr. Gradgrind, \"we are all liable to mistakes   \"\n\n\"I thought you couldn't make 'em,\" interrupted Bounderby.\n\n\"Perhaps I thought so.  But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I\nshould feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would\nspare me these references to Harthouse.  I shall not associate him in our\nconversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in\nconnecting him with mine.\"\n\n\"I never mentioned his name!\" said Bounderby.\n\n\"Well, well!\" returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive,\nair.  And he sat for a little while pondering.  \"Bounderby, I see reason\nto doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean by We?\"\n\n\"Let me say I, then,\" he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted\nquestion; \"I doubt whether I have understood Louisa.  I doubt whether I\nhave been quite right in the manner of her education.\"\n\n\"There you hit it,\" returned Bounderby.  \"There I agree with you.  You\nhave found it out at last, have you?  Education!  I'll tell you what\neducation is   To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the\nshortest allowance of everything except blows.  That's what _I_ call\neducation.\"\n\n\"I think your good sense will perceive,\" Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in\nall humility, \"that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would\nbe difficult of general application to girls.\"\n\n\"I don't see it at all, sir,\" returned the obstinate Bounderby.\n\n\"Well,\" sighed Mr. Gradgrind, \"we will not enter into the question.  I\nassure you I have no desire to be controversial.  I seek to repair what\nis amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good\nspirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, yet,\" said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy,\n\"and therefore I won't make any promises.\"\n\n\"In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,\" Mr. Gradgrind\nproceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, \"I appear to\nmyself to have become better informed as to Louisa's character, than in\nprevious years.  The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and\nthe discovery is not mine.  I think there are   Bounderby, you will be\nsurprised to hear me say this   I think there are qualities in Louisa,\nwhich   which have been harshly neglected, and   and a little perverted.\nAnd   and I would suggest to you, that   that if you would kindly meet me in\na timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while   and to\nencourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration   it   it\nwould be the better for the happiness of all of us.  Louisa,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind, shading his face with his hand, \"has always been my favourite\nchild.\"\n\nThe blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on\nhearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink\nof a fit.  With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent\nup his indignation, however, and said:\n\n\"You'd like to keep her here for a time?\"\n\n\"I   I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow\nLouisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of\ncourse Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.\"\n\n\"I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,\" said Bounderby, standing up with\nhis hands in his pockets, \"that you are of opinion that there's what\npeople call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.\"\n\n\"I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa,\nand   and   and almost all the relations in which I have placed her,\" was her\nfather's sorrowful reply.\n\n\"Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,\" said Bounderby the flushed,\nconfronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his\npockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was\nboisterous.  \"You have said your say; I am going to say mine.  I am a\nCoketown man.  I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.  I know the bricks of\nthis town, and I know the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of\nthis town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of\nthis town.  I know 'em all pretty well.  They're real.  When a man tells\nme anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever\nhe is, that I know what he means.  He means turtle soup and venison, with\na gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six.\nThat's what your daughter wants.  Since you are of opinion that she ought\nto have what she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.  Because,\nTom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.\"\n\n\"Bounderby,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"I hoped, after my entreaty, you would\nhave taken a different tone.\"\n\n\"Just wait a bit,\" retorted Bounderby; \"you have said your say, I\nbelieve.  I heard you out; hear me out, if you please.  Don't make\nyourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency, because,\nalthough I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position,\nI should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that.  Now, there's\nan incompatibility of some sort or another, I am given to understand by\nyou, between your daughter and me.  I'll give _you_ to understand, in\nreply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the\nfirst magnitude   to be summed up in this   that your daughter don't properly\nknow her husband's merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as\nwould become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance.  That's plain\nspeaking, I hope.\"\n\n\"Bounderby,\" urged Mr. Gradgrind, \"this is unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said Bounderby.  \"I am glad to hear you say so.  Because when\nTom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is\nunreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.  With\nyour permission I am going on.  You know my origin; and you know that for\na good many years of my life I didn't want a shoeing-horn, in consequence\nof not having a shoe.  Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper,\nthat there are ladies   born ladies   belonging to families   Families!   who\nnext to worship the ground I walk on.\"\n\nHe discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law's head.\n\n\"Whereas your daughter,\" proceeded Bounderby, \"is far from being a born\nlady.  That you know, yourself.  Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff\nabout such things, for you are very well aware I don't; but that such is\nthe fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can't change it.  Why do I say this?\"\n\n\"Not, I fear,\" observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, \"to spare me.\"\n\n\"Hear me out,\" said Bounderby, \"and refrain from cutting in till your\nturn comes round.  I say this, because highly connected females have been\nastonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself,\nand to witness her insensibility.  They have wondered how I have suffered\nit.  And I wonder myself now, and I won't suffer it.\"\n\n\"Bounderby,\" returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising, \"the less we say to-night\nthe better, I think.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say to-night, the better, I\nthink.  That is,\" the consideration checked him, \"till I have said all I\nmean to say, and then I don't care how soon we stop.  I come to a\nquestion that may shorten the business.  What do you mean by the proposal\nyou made just now?\"\n\n\"What do I mean, Bounderby?\"\n\n\"By your visiting proposition,\" said Bounderby, with an inflexible jerk\nof the hayfield.\n\n\"I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner,\nfor allowing Louisa a period of repose and reflection here, which may\ntend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects.\"\n\n\"To a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility?\" said\nBounderby.\n\n\"If you put it in those terms.\"\n\n\"What made you think of this?\" said Bounderby.\n\n\"I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood.  Is it\nasking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in\ntrying to set her right?  You have accepted a great charge of her; for\nbetter for worse, for   \"\n\nMr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to\nStephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short with an angry start.\n\n\"Come!\" said he, \"I don't want to be told about that.  I know what I took\nher for, as well as you do.  Never you mind what I took her for; that's\nmy look out.\"\n\n\"I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or\nless in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your\npart, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of\ntrue kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\"\n\n\"I think differently,\" blustered Bounderby.  \"I am going to finish this\nbusiness according to my own opinions.  Now, I don't want to make a\nquarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind.  To tell you the truth, I don't\nthink it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.\nAs to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes\nbest.  If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don't fall\nin my way, I shan't, for it won't be worth my while to do it.  As to your\ndaughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by\nleaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don't come home to-morrow, by twelve\no'clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I\nshall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you'll take\ncharge of her for the future.  What I shall say to people in general, of\nthe incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.\nI am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she's the daughter of\nTom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn't\npull together.  I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I\nbelieve; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a\nwoman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up\nto my mark.\"\n\n\"Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,\" urged Mr.\nGradgrind, \"before you commit yourself to such a decision.\"\n\n\"I always come to a decision,\" said Bounderby, tossing his hat on: \"and\nwhatever I do, I do at once.  I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind's\naddressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he\nknows of him, if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did,\nafter his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  I have given you\nmy decision, and I have got no more to say.  Good night!\"\n\nSo Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  At five minutes\npast twelve o'clock next day, he directed Mrs. Bounderby's property to be\ncarefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind's; advertised his country\nretreat for sale by private contract; and resumed a bachelor life.\n\n\n\n",

In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity, as\na remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial wonder more\nadmirable than Venus, who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea, he\nliked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour.\nConsequently, in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood, he even\nadvanced upon his usual display of bustle, and every day made such a rout\nin renewing his investigations into the robbery, that the officers who\nhad it in hand almost wished it had never been committed.\n\nThey were at fault too, and off the scent.  Although they had been so\nquiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did\nsuppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred.  No\nimplicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying\nstep.  More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and\nthe mysterious old woman remained a mystery.\n\nThings having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring\nbeyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby's investigations was, that he\nresolved to hazard a bold burst.  He drew up a placard, offering Twenty\nPounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of\ncomplicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described\nthe said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and\nmanner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and\nin what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed\nin great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls\nto be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon\nthe sight of the whole population at one blow.\n\nThe factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse\nthe groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round\nthe placards, devouring them with eager eyes.  Not the least eager of the\neyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read.  These people,\nas they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud   there was always\nsome such ready to help them   stared at the characters which meant so much\nwith a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any\naspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and\nfull of evil.  Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter\nof these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling\nwheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into\nthe streets, there were still as many readers as before.\n\nSlackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night;\nand Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had\nbrought it in his pocket.  Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the\ndown-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and\nfellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was\nthere, when Slackbridge unfolded what he called \"that damning document,\"\nand held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man\ncommunity!  \"Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of\nthose great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and\nof Union, is appropriately capable!  Oh, my prostrate friends, with the\ngalling yoke of tyrants on your necks and the iron foot of despotism\ntreading down your fallen forms into the dust of the earth, upon which\nright glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies\nall the days of your lives, like the serpent in the garden   oh, my\nbrothers, and shall I as a man not add, my sisters too, what do you say,\n_now_, of Stephen Blackpool, with a slight stoop in his shoulders and\nabout five foot seven in height, as set forth in this degrading and\ndisgusting document, this blighting bill, this pernicious placard, this\nabominable advertisement; and with what majesty of denouncement will you\ncrush the viper, who would bring this stain and shame upon the God-like\nrace that happily has cast him out for ever!  Yes, my compatriots,\nhappily cast him out and sent him forth!  For you remember how he stood\nhere before you on this platform; you remember how, face to face and foot\nto foot, I pursued him through all his intricate windings; you remember\nhow he sneaked and slunk, and sidled, and splitted of straws, until, with\nnot an inch of ground to which to cling, I hurled him out from amongst\nus: an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and for the\navenging fire of every free and thinking mind to scorch and scar!  And\nnow, my friends   my labouring friends, for I rejoice and triumph in that\nstigma   my friends whose hard but honest beds are made in toil, and whose\nscanty but independent pots are boiled in hardship; and now, I say, my\nfriends, what appellation has that dastard craven taken to himself, when,\nwith the mask torn from his features, he stands before us in all his\nnative deformity, a What?  A thief!  A plunderer!  A proscribed fugitive,\nwith a price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the noble character\nof the Coketown operative!  Therefore, my band of brothers in a sacred\nbond, to which your children and your children's children yet unborn have\nset their infant hands and seals, I propose to you on the part of the\nUnited Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare, ever zealous\nfor your benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen Blackpool,\nweaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly\ndisowned by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are free from the\nshame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a class be reproached with his\ndishonest actions!\"\n\nThus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort.  A few\nstern voices called out \"No!\" and a score or two hailed, with assenting\ncries of \"Hear, hear!\" the caution from one man, \"Slackbridge, y'or over\nhetter in't; y'or a goen too fast!\"  But these were pigmies against an\narmy; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to\nSlackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively\npanting at them.\n\nThese men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their\nhomes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes\nbefore, returned.\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked Louisa.\n\n\"It is Mr. Bounderby,\" said Sissy, timid of the name, \"and your brother\nMr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you\nknow her.\"\n\n\"What do they want, Sissy dear?\"\n\n\"They want to see you.  Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Louisa, for he was present, \"I cannot refuse to see them,\nfor a reason that will explain itself.  Shall they come in here?\"\n\nAs he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them.  She\nreappeared with them directly.  Tom was last; and remained standing in\nthe obscurest part of the room, near the door.\n\n\"Mrs. Bounderby,\" said her husband, entering with a cool nod, \"I don't\ndisturb you, I hope.  This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young\nwoman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.\nTom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate reason\nor other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am\nobliged to confront her with your daughter.\"\n\n\"You have seen me once before, young lady,\" said Rachael, standing in\nfront of Louisa.\n\nTom coughed.\n\n\"You have seen me, young lady,\" repeated Rachael, as she did not answer,\n\"once before.\"\n\nTom coughed again.\n\n\"I have.\"\n\nRachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said, \"Will you\nmake it known, young lady, where, and who was there?\"\n\n\"I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged, on the night of his\ndischarge from his work, and I saw you there.  He was there too; and an\nold woman who did not speak, and whom I could scarcely see, stood in a\ndark corner.  My brother was with me.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you say so, young Tom?\" demanded Bounderby.\n\n\"I promised my sister I wouldn't.\"  Which Louisa hastily confirmed.  \"And\nbesides,\" said the whelp bitterly, \"she tells her own story so precious\nwell   and so full   that what business had I to take it out of her mouth!\"\n\n\"Say, young lady, if you please,\" pursued Rachael, \"why, in an evil hour,\nyou ever came to Stephen's that night.\"\n\n\"I felt compassion for him,\" said Louisa, her colour deepening, \"and I\nwished to know what he was going to do, and wished to offer him\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Bounderby.  \"Much flattered and obliged.\"\n\n\"Did you offer him,\" asked Rachael, \"a bank-note?\"\n\n\"Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.\"\n\nRachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again.\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\" said Bounderby.  \"If you put the question whether your\nridiculous and improbable account was true or not, I am bound to say it's\nconfirmed.\"\n\n\"Young lady,\" said Rachael, \"Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in\npublic print all over this town, and where else!  There have been a\nmeeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way.\nStephen!  The honestest lad, the truest lad, the best!\"  Her indignation\nfailed her, and she broke off sobbing.\n\n\"I am very, very sorry,\" said Louisa.\n\n\"Oh, young lady, young lady,\" returned Rachael, \"I hope you may be, but I\ndon't know!  I can't say what you may ha' done!  The like of you don't\nknow us, don't care for us, don't belong to us.  I am not sure why you\nmay ha' come that night.  I can't tell but what you may ha' come wi' some\naim of your own, not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor\nlad.  I said then, Bless you for coming; and I said it of my heart, you\nseemed to take so pitifully to him; but I don't know now, I don't know!\"\n\nLouisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions; she was so\nfaithful to her idea of the man, and so afflicted.\n\n\"And when I think,\" said Rachael through her sobs, \"that the poor lad was\nso grateful, thinkin you so good to him   when I mind that he put his hand\nover his hard-worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there   Oh,\nI hope you may be sorry, and ha' no bad cause to be it; but I don't know,\nI don't know!\"\n\n\"You're a pretty article,\" growled the whelp, moving uneasily in his dark\ncorner, \"to come here with these precious imputations!  You ought to be\nbundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself, and you would be by\nrights.\"\n\nShe said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was the only sound that\nwas heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke.\n\n\"Come!\" said he, \"you know what you have engaged to do.  You had better\ngive your mind to that; not this.\"\n\n\"'Deed, I am loath,\" returned Rachael, drying her eyes, \"that any here\nshould see me like this; but I won't be seen so again.  Young lady, when\nI had read what's put in print of Stephen   and what has just as much truth\nin it as if it had been put in print of you   I went straight to the Bank\nto say I knew where Stephen was, and to give a sure and certain promise\nthat he should be here in two days.  I couldn't meet wi' Mr. Bounderby\nthen, and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you was\nnot to be found, and I went back to work.  Soon as I come out of the Mill\nto-night, I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen   for I know wi'\npride he will come back to shame it!   and then I went again to seek Mr.\nBounderby, and I found him, and I told him every word I knew; and he\nbelieved no word I said, and brought me here.\"\n\n\"So far, that's true enough,\" assented Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in\nhis pockets and his hat on.  \"But I have known you people before to-day,\nyou'll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking.  Now, I\nrecommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing.  You have\nundertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!\"\n\n\"I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I\nhave written to him once before sin' he went away,\" said Rachael; \"and he\nwill be here, at furthest, in two days.\"\n\n\"Then, I'll tell you something.  You are not aware perhaps,\" retorted Mr.\nBounderby, \"that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not\nbeing considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account\nof most people being judged according to the company they keep.  The\npost-office hasn't been forgotten either.  What I'll tell you is, that no\nletter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.  Therefore, what has\nbecome of yours, I leave you to guess.  Perhaps you're mistaken, and\nnever wrote any.\"\n\n\"He hadn't been gone from here, young lady,\" said Rachael, turning\nappealingly to Louisa, \"as much as a week, when he sent me the only\nletter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in\nanother name.\"\n\n\"Oh, by George!\" cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, \"he\nchanges his name, does he!  That's rather unlucky, too, for such an\nimmaculate chap.  It's considered a little suspicious in Courts of\nJustice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.\"\n\n\"What,\" said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, \"what, young\nlady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!  The masters\nagainst him on one hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin\nto work hard in peace, and do what he felt right.  Can a man have no soul\nof his own, no mind of his own?  Must he go wrong all through wi' this\nside, or must he go wrong all through wi' that, or else be hunted like a\nhare?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,\" returned Louisa; \"and I hope\nthat he will clear himself.\"\n\n\"You need have no fear of that, young lady.  He is sure!\"\n\n\"All the surer, I suppose,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"for your refusing to\ntell where he is?  Eh?\"\n\n\"He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi' the unmerited\nreproach of being brought back.  He shall come back of his own accord to\nclear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character,\nand he not here for its defence, to shame.  I have told him what has been\ndone against him,\" said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock\nthrows off the sea, \"and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding which,\" added Mr. Bounderby, \"if he can be laid hold of\nany sooner, he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.  As\nto you, I have nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out\nto be true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true, and\nthere's an end of it.  I wish you good night all!  I must be off to look\na little further into this.\"\n\nTom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved with him, kept\nclose to him, and went away with him.  The only parting salutation of\nwhich he delivered himself was a sulky \"Good night, father!\"  With a\nbrief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.\n\nSince his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of\nspeech.  He still sat silent, when Louisa mildly said:\n\n\"Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.\"\n\n\"It goes against me,\" Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, \"to mistrust\nany one; but when I am so mistrusted   when we all are   I cannot keep such\nthings quite out of my mind.  I ask your pardon for having done you an\ninjury.  I don't think what I said now.  Yet I might come to think it\nagain, wi' the poor lad so wronged.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him in your letter,\" inquired Sissy, \"that suspicion seemed\nto have fallen upon him, because he had been seen about the Bank at\nnight?  He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back,\nand would be ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" she returned; \"but I can't guess what can have ever taken\nhim there.  He never used to go there.  It was never in his way.  His way\nwas the same as mine, and not near it.\"\n\nSissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and\nwhether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of\nhim.\n\n\"I doubt,\" said Rachael, \"if he can be here till next day.\"\n\n\"Then I will come next night too,\" said Sissy.\n\nWhen Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his\nhead, and said to his daughter:\n\n\"Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.  Do you\nbelieve him to be implicated?\"\n\n\"I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  I do\nnot believe it now.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing\nhim to be suspected.  His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\"\n\n\"Very honest.\"\n\n\"And her confidence not to be shaken!  I ask myself,\" said Mr. Gradgrind,\nmusing, \"does the real culprit know of these accusations?  Where is he?\nWho is he?\"\n\nHis hair had latterly began to change its colour.  As he leaned upon his\nhand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity,\nhurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side.  Her eyes by\naccident met Sissy's at the moment.  Sissy flushed and started, and\nLouisa put her finger on her lip.\n\nNext night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not\ncome, she told it in a whisper.  Next night again, when she came home\nwith the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke\nin the same low frightened tone.  From the moment of that interchange of\nlooks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor\never pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it.\n\nThe two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and\nStephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  On the fourth\nday, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to\nhave miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with\nhis address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,\nsixty miles away.  Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town\nlooked for Stephen to be brought in next day.\n\nDuring this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his\nshadow, assisting in all the proceedings.  He was greatly excited,\nhorribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard\nrattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.  At the hour\nwhen the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station;\noffering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who\nwere sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear.\n\nThe whelp was right.  The messengers returned alone.  Rachael's letter\nhad gone, Rachael's letter had been delivered.  Stephen Blackpool had\ndecamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.  The only doubt\nin Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith, believing\nthat he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  On this point\nopinion was divided.\n\nSix days, seven days, far on into another week.  The wretched whelp\nplucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant.  \"_Was_ the\nsuspected fellow the thief?  A pretty question!  If not, where was the\nman, and why did he not come back?\"\n\nWhere was the man, and why did he not come back?  In the dead of night\nthe echoes of his own words, which had rolled Heaven knows how far away\nin the daytime, came back instead, and abided by him until morning.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " V\nFOUND\n\n\nDAY and night again, day and night again.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where\nwas the man, and why did he not come back?\n\nEvery night, Sissy went to Rachael's lodging, and sat with her in her\nsmall neat room.  All day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil,\nwhatever their anxieties.  The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was\nlost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants,\nlike the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever\nhappened.  Day and night again, day and night again.  The monotony was\nunbroken.  Even Stephen Blackpool's disappearance was falling into the\ngeneral way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of\nmachinery in Coketown.\n\n\"I misdoubt,\" said Rachael, \"if there is as many as twenty left in all\nthis place, who have any trust in the poor dear lad now.\"\n\nShe said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the\nlamp at the street corner.  Sissy had come there when it was already\ndark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window\nwhere Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their\nsorrowful talk.\n\n\"If it hadn't been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to\nspeak to,\" pursued Rachael, \"times are, when I think my mind would not\nhave kept right.  But I get hope and strength through you; and you\nbelieve that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved\nclear?\"\n\n\"I do believe so,\" returned Sissy, \"with my whole heart.  I feel so\ncertain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all\ndiscouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him\nthan if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.\"\n\n\"And I, my dear,\" said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, \"have known\nhim through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to\neverything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and\nI was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath,\nGod knows my heart.  I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!\"\n\n\"We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from\nsuspicion, sooner or later.\"\n\n\"The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,\" said Rachael,\n\"and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to\ncomfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi' me when I am not yet\nfree from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever\nhave spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.  And yet I   \"\n\n\"You don't mistrust her now, Rachael?\"\n\n\"Now that you have brought us more together, no.  But I can't at all\ntimes keep out of my mind   \"\n\nHer voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy,\nsitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention.\n\n\"I can't at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.  I\ncan't think who 'tis, I can't think how or why it may be done, but I\nmistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.  I mistrust that\nby his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before\nthem all, some one would be confounded, who   to prevent that   has stopped\nhim, and put him out of the way.\"\n\n\"That is a dreadful thought,\" said Sissy, turning pale.\n\n\"It _is_ a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.\"\n\nSissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.\n\n\"When it makes its way into my mind, dear,\" said Rachael, \"and it will\ncome sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi' counting on to\nhigh numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew\nwhen I were a child   I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however\ntired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.  I must get the better\nof this before bed-time.  I'll walk home wi' you.\"\n\n\"He might fall ill upon the journey back,\" said Sissy, faintly offering a\nworn-out scrap of hope; \"and in such a case, there are many places on the\nroad where he might stop.\"\n\n\"But he is in none of them.  He has been sought for in all, and he's not\nthere.\"\n\n\"True,\" was Sissy's reluctant admission.\n\n\"He'd walk the journey in two days.  If he was footsore and couldn't\nwalk, I sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should\nhave none of his own to spare.\"\n\n\"Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, Rachael.  Come\ninto the air!\"\n\nHer gentle hand adjusted Rachael's shawl upon her shining black hair in\nthe usual manner of her wearing it, and they went out.  The night being\nfine, little knots of Hands were here and there lingering at street\ncorners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and there\nwere but few people in the streets.\n\n\"You're not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand is cooler.\"\n\n\"I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a little fresh.\n'Times when I can't, I turn weak and confused.\"\n\n\"But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be wanted at any\ntime to stand by Stephen.  To-morrow is Saturday.  If no news comes\nto-morrow, let us walk in the country on Sunday morning, and strengthen\nyou for another week.  Will you go?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\nThey were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby's house stood.\nThe way to Sissy's destination led them past the door, and they were\ngoing straight towards it.  Some train had newly arrived in Coketown,\nwhich had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a\nconsiderable bustle about the town.  Several coaches were rattling before\nthem and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby's, and one of the\nlatter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the\nhouse, that they looked round involuntarily.  The bright gaslight over\nMr. Bounderby's steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an\necstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing\nthem at the same moment, called to them to stop.\n\n\"It's a coincidence,\" exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the\ncoachman.  \"It's a Providence!  Come out, ma'am!\" then said Mrs. Sparsit,\nto some one inside, \"come out, or we'll have you dragged out!\"\n\nHereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.  Whom Mrs.\nSparsit incontinently collared.\n\n\"Leave her alone, everybody!\" cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy.\n\"Let nobody touch her.  She belongs to me.  Come in, ma'am!\" then said\nMrs. Sparsit, reversing her former word of command.  \"Come in, ma'am, or\nwe'll have you dragged in!\"\n\nThe spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient\nwoman by the throat, and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have\nbeen under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English\nstragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that\ndwelling-house and see the matter out.  But when the phenomenon was\nenhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over\nthe town with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,\nwith an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to\nfall upon their heads.  Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground,\nconsisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some\nfive-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in\nafter Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly\nirruption into Mr. Bounderby's dining-room, where the people behind lost\nnot a moment's time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the\npeople in front.\n\n\"Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!\" cried Mrs. Sparsit.  \"Rachael, young woman;\nyou know who this is?\"\n\n\"It's Mrs. Pegler,\" said Rachael.\n\n\"I should think it is!\" cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting.  \"Fetch Mr.\nBounderby.  Stand away, everybody!\"  Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling\nherself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty.\n\"Don't tell me,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud.  \"I have told you twenty\ntimes, coming along, that I will _not_ leave you till I have handed you\nover to him myself.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp,\nwith whom he had been holding conference up-stairs.  Mr. Bounderby looked\nmore astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his\ndining-room.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter now!\" said he.  \"Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" explained that worthy woman, \"I trust it is my good fortune to\nproduce a person you have much desired to find.  Stimulated by my wish to\nrelieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to\nthe part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside,\nas have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now\npresent to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring\nthat person with me   I need not say most unwillingly on her part.  It has\nnot been, sir, without some trouble that I have effected this; but\ntrouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold\na real gratification.\"\n\nHere Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby's visage exhibited an\nextraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of\ndiscomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his view.\n\n\"Why, what do you mean by this?\" was his highly unexpected demand, in\ngreat warmth.  \"I ask you, what do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit,\nma'am?\"\n\n\"Sir!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.\n\n\"Why don't you mind your own business, ma'am?\" roared Bounderby.  \"How\ndare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs?\"\n\nThis allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit.  She sat\ndown stiffly in a chair, as if she were frozen; and with a fixed stare at\nMr. Bounderby, slowly grated her mittens against one another, as if they\nwere frozen too.\n\n\"My dear Josiah!\" cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling.  \"My darling boy!  I am\nnot to blame.  It's not my fault, Josiah.  I told this lady over and over\nagain, that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but\nshe would do it.\"\n\n\"What did you let her bring you for?  Couldn't you knock her cap off, or\nher tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?\" asked\nBounderby.\n\n\"My own boy!  She threatened me that if I resisted her, I should be\nbrought by constables, and it was better to come quietly than make that\nstir in such a\"   Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the\nwalls   \"such a fine house as this.  Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault!\nMy dear, noble, stately boy!  I have always lived quiet, and secret,\nJosiah, my dear.  I have never broken the condition once.  I have never\nsaid I was your mother.  I have admired you at a distance; and if I have\ncome to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud peep at\nyou, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.\"\n\nMr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient\nmortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the\nspectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler's appeal, and\nat each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.  Mr.\nBounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr.\nGradgrind addressed that maligned old lady:\n\n\"I am surprised, madam,\" he observed with severity, \"that in your old age\nyou have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your\nunnatural and inhuman treatment of him.\"\n\n\"_Me_ unnatural!\" cried poor old Mrs. Pegler.  \"_Me_ inhuman!  To my dear\nboy?\"\n\n\"Dear!\" repeated Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity,\nmadam, I dare say.  Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his\ninfancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.\"\n\n\"_I_ deserted my Josiah!\" cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands.  \"Now,\nLord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal\nagainst the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah\nwas born.  May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!\"\n\nShe was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the\npossibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone:\n\n\"Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to   to be brought up in\nthe gutter?\"\n\n\"Josiah in the gutter!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.  \"No such a thing, sir.\nNever!  For shame on you!  My dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to\nknow, that though he come of humble parents, he come of parents that\nloved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on\nthemselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful, and\nI've his books at home to show it!  Aye, have I!\" said Mrs. Pegler, with\nindignant pride.  \"And my dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to know,\nsir, that after his beloved father died, when he was eight years old, his\nmother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her duty and her pleasure and\nher pride to do it, to help him out in life, and put him 'prentice.  And\na steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand, and\nwell he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving.  And _I_'ll\ngive you to know, sir   for this my dear boy won't   that though his mother\nkept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but pensioned me on\nthirty pound a year   more than I want, for I put by out of it   only making\nthe condition that I was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts\nabout him, and not trouble him.  And I never have, except with looking at\nhim once a year, when he has never knowed it.  And it's right,\" said poor\nold Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, \"that I _should_ keep down\nin my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a\nmany unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride\nin my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love's own sake!  And I am\nashamed of you, sir,\" said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \"for your slanders and\nsuspicions.  And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand\nhere when my dear son said no.  And I shouldn't be here now, if it hadn't\nbeen for being brought here.  And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to\naccuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to\ntell you so different!\"\n\nThe bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of\nsympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently\nplaced in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had\nnever ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and\nlarger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.\n\n\"I don't exactly know,\" said Mr. Bounderby, \"how I come to be favoured\nwith the attendance of the present company, but I don't inquire.  When\nthey're quite satisfied, perhaps they'll be so good as to disperse;\nwhether they're satisfied or not, perhaps they'll be so good as to\ndisperse.  I'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I\nhave not undertaken to do it, and I'm not a going to do it.  Therefore\nthose who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the\nsubject, will be disappointed   particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he can't\nknow it too soon.  In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a\nmistake made, concerning my mother.  If there hadn't been\nover-officiousness it wouldn't have been made, and I hate\nover-officiousness at all times, whether or no. Good evening!\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door\nopen for the company to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon\nhim, at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd.  Detected as\nthe Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and\nin his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if\nhe had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to\na pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.  With the people filing off\nat the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole\ntown, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a Bully\nmore shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  Even that\nunlucky female, Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into\nthe Slough of Despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man\nand self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.\n\nRachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son's for\nthat night, walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted.\nMr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with\nmuch interest of Stephen Blackpool; for whom he thought this signal\nfailure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.\n\nAs to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he\nhad stuck close to Bounderby.  He seemed to feel that as long as\nBounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge, he was so far\nsafe.  He never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she\nwent home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to\nBounderby, as already related.\n\nThere was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister's mind, to\nwhich she never gave utterance, which surrounded the graceless and\nungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.  The same dark possibility had\npresented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to Sissy,\nwhen Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen's\nreturn, having put him out of the way.  Louisa had never spoken of\nharbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery,\nshe and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one\ninterchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on\nhis hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.\nThis other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a\nghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far\nless of its being near the other.\n\nAnd still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with\nhim.  If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief, let him show himself.  Why\ndidn't he?\n\nAnother night.  Another day and night.  No Stephen Blackpool.  Where was\nthe man, and why did he not come back?\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VI\nTHE STARLIGHT\n\n\nTHE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in\nthe morning Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country.\n\nAs Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the\nneighbourhood's too   after the manner of those pious persons who do\npenance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth   it was\ncustomary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air,\nwhich is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to\nget a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their\nlounge in the fields.  Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the\nsmoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway\nbetween the town and Mr. Bounderby's retreat.\n\nThough the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal,\nit was green elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks\nsinging (though it was Sunday), and there were pleasant scents in the\nair, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky.  In the distance one\nway, Coketown showed as a black mist; in another distance hills began to\nrise; in a third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon\nwhere it shone upon the far-off sea.  Under their feet, the grass was\nfresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it, and speckled it;\nhedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at peace.  Engines at pits'\nmouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily\nlabour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short\nspace to turn; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the\nshocks and noises of another time.\n\nThey walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes\ngetting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch\nof the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown\nwith grass, marking the site of deserted works.  They followed paths and\ntracks, however slight.  Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and\nwhere brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly\nheaped together, they always avoided; for dismal stories were told in\nthat country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications.\n\nThe sun was high when they sat down to rest.  They had seen no one, near\nor distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken.  \"It is\nso still here, Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that I think we must\nbe the first who have been here all the summer.\"\n\nAs Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten\nfragments of fence upon the ground.  She got up to look at it.  \"And yet\nI don't know.  This has not been broken very long.  The wood is quite\nfresh where it gave way.  Here are footsteps too.   O Rachael!\"\n\nShe ran back, and caught her round the neck.  Rachael had already started\nup.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  There is a hat lying in the grass.\"  They went forward\ntogether.  Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.  She broke into\na passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his\nown hand on the inside.\n\n\"O the poor lad, the poor lad!  He has been made away with.  He is lying\nmurdered here!\"\n\n\"Is there   has the hat any blood upon it?\" Sissy faltered.\n\nThey were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of\nviolence, inside or out.  It had been lying there some days, for rain and\ndew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it\nhad fallen.  They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could\nsee nothing more.  \"Rachael,\" Sissy whispered, \"I will go on a little by\nmyself.\"\n\nShe had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when\nRachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the\nwide landscape.  Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a\nblack ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.  They sprang back, and fell\nupon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other's neck.\n\n\"O, my good Lord!  He's down there!  Down there!\"  At first this, and her\nterrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears,\nby any prayers, by any representations, by any means.  It was impossible\nto hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have\nflung herself down the shaft.\n\n\"Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these\ndreadful cries!  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\"\n\nBy an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of\nsuch a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her\nwith a tearless face of stone.\n\n\"Rachael, Stephen may be living.  You wouldn't leave him lying maimed at\nthe bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to\nhim?\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\"\n\n\"Don't stir from here, for his sake!  Let me go and listen.\"\n\nShe shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands\nand knees, and called to him as loud as she could call.  She listened,\nbut no sound replied.  She called again and listened; still no answering\nsound.  She did this, twenty, thirty times.  She took a little clod of\nearth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.  She\ncould not hear it fall.\n\nThe wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago,\nalmost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all\nround her, seeing no help.  \"Rachael, we must lose not a moment.  We must\ngo in different directions, seeking aid.  You shall go by the way we have\ncome, and I will go forward by the path.  Tell any one you see, and every\none what has happened.  Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\"\n\nShe knew by Rachael's face that she might trust her now.  And after\nstanding for a moment to see her running, wringing her hands as she ran,\nshe turned and went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to tie\nher shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her bonnet aside, and\nran as she had never run before.\n\nRun, Sissy, run, in Heaven's name!  Don't stop for breath.  Run, run!\nQuickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran\nfrom field to field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had\nnever run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house, where two\nmen lay in the shade, asleep on straw.\n\nFirst to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as\nshe was, what had brought her there, were difficulties; but they no\nsooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers.  One of\nthe men was in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade's shouting to him\nthat a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a pool\nof dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.\n\nWith these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that\none to another, while they ran elsewhere.  Then a horse was found; and\nshe got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a\nmessage to Louisa, which she wrote and gave him.  By this time a whole\nvillage was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all\nthings necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place,\nto be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.\n\nIt seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in\nthe grave where he had been buried alive.  She could not bear to remain\naway from it any longer   it was like deserting him   and she hurried swiftly\nback, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man\nwhom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.  When they\ncame to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it.\nThe men called and listened as she had done, and examined the edge of the\nchasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until\nthe implements they wanted should come up.\n\nEvery sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every\nwhisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry\nat the bottom of the pit.  But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound\narose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.\nAfter they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the\naccident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to\narrive.  In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her party there\nwas a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.  But, the expectation\namong the people that the man would be found alive was very slight\nindeed.\n\nThere being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man\nput himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general\nconsent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed\nmen to keep it.  Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only\nSissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in\nthe day, when the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind\nand Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.\n\nThe sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat\ndown upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend\nsecurely was rigged with poles and ropes.  Difficulties had arisen in the\nconstruction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found\nwanting, and messages had had to go and return.  It was five o'clock in\nthe afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent\ndown to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close\ntogether, attentively watching it: the man at the windlass lowering as\nthey were told.  The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and\nthen some water was cast in.  Then the bucket was hooked on; and the\nsobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word \"Lower away!\"\n\nAs the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there\nwas not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on,\nthat came as it was wont to come.  The signal was given and the windlass\nstopped, with abundant rope to spare.  Apparently so long an interval\nensued with the men at the windlass standing idle, that some women\nshrieked that another accident had happened!  But the surgeon who held\nthe watch, declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet, and sternly\nadmonished them to keep silence.  He had not well done speaking, when the\nwindlass was reversed and worked again.  Practised eyes knew that it did\nnot go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up, and\nthat only one was returning.\n\nThe rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was coiled upon\nthe barrel of the windlass, and all eyes were fastened on the pit.  The\nsobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass.  There\nwas an universal cry of \"Alive or dead?\" and then a deep, profound hush.\n\nWhen he said \"Alive!\" a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in\nthem.\n\n\"But he's hurt very bad,\" he added, as soon as he could make himself\nheard again.  \"Where's doctor?  He's hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno\nhow to get him up.\"\n\nThey all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he\nasked some questions, and shook his head on receiving the replies.  The\nsun was setting now; and the red light in the evening sky touched every\nface there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense.\n\nThe consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass, and the\npitman going down again, carrying the wine and some other small matters\nwith him.  Then the other man came up.  In the meantime, under the\nsurgeon's directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others made a\nthick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself\ncontrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.  As\nthese were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last\ncome up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood, shown by the\nlight he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles,\nand sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon\nthe people, he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene.  It was\ndark now, and torches were kindled.\n\nIt appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was\nquickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a\nmass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that\nhis fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side.  He\nlay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his\nown belief had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his\nfree hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and\nmeat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a\nlittle water in it now and then.  He had come straight away from his\nwork, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on\nhis way to Mr. Bounderby's country house after dark, when he fell.  He\nwas crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he\nwas innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn't rest from\ncoming the nearest way to deliver himself up.  The Old Hell Shaft, the\npitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the\nlast; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it would soon be\nfound to have mangled the life out of him.\n\nWhen all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from\nhis comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him,\ndisappeared into the pit.  The rope went out as before, the signal was\nmade as before, and the windlass stopped.  No man removed his hand from\nit now.  Every one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to\nthe work, ready to reverse and wind in.  At length the signal was given,\nand all the ring leaned forward.\n\nFor, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its utmost as it\nappeared, and the men turned heavily, and the windlass complained.  It\nwas scarcely endurable to look at the rope, and think of its giving way.\nBut, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely,\nand the connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two\nmen holding on at the sides   a sight to make the head swim, and oppress\nthe heart   and tenderly supporting between them, slung and tied within,\nthe figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.\n\nA low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as\nthis form, almost without form, was moved very slowly from its iron\ndeliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.  At first, none but the\nsurgeon went close to it.  He did what he could in its adjustment on the\ncouch, but the best that he could do was to cover it.  That gently done,\nhe called to him Rachael and Sissy.  And at that time the pale, worn,\npatient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand\nlying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as if waiting to be\ntaken by another hand.\n\nThey gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and administered some\ndrops of cordial and wine.  Though he lay quite motionless looking up at\nthe sky, he smiled and said, \"Rachael.\"  She stooped down on the grass at\nhis side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky,\nfor he could not so much as turn them to look at her.\n\n\"Rachael, my dear.\"\n\nShe took his hand.  He smiled again and said, \"Don't let 't go.\"\n\n\"Thou'rt in great pain, my own dear Stephen?\"\n\n\"I ha' been, but not now.  I ha' been   dreadful, and dree, and long, my\ndear   but 'tis ower now.  Ah, Rachael, aw a muddle!  Fro' first to last, a\nmuddle!\"\n\nThe spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word.\n\n\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o'\nold fok now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives   fathers, sons,\nbrothers, dear to thousands an' thousands, an' keeping 'em fro' want and\nhunger.  I ha' fell into a pit that ha' been wi' th' Firedamp crueller\nthan battle.  I ha' read on 't in the public petition, as onny one may\nread, fro' the men that works in pits, in which they ha' pray'n and\npray'n the lawmakers for Christ's sake not to let their work be murder to\n'em, but to spare 'em for th' wives and children that they loves as well\nas gentlefok loves theirs.  When it were in work, it killed wi'out need;\nwhen 'tis let alone, it kills wi'out need.  See how we die an' no need,\none way an' another   in a muddle   every day!\"\n\nHe faintly said it, without any anger against any one.  Merely as the\ntruth.\n\n\"Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  Thou'rt not like\nto forget her now, and me so nigh her.  Thou know'st   poor, patient,\nsuff'rin, dear   how thou didst work for her, seet'n all day long in her\nlittle chair at thy winder, and how she died, young and misshapen, awlung\no' sickly air as had'n no need to be, an' awlung o' working people's\nmiserable homes.  A muddle!  Aw a muddle!\"\n\nLouisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face\nturned up to the night sky.\n\n\"If aw th' things that tooches us, my dear, was not so muddled, I\nshould'n ha' had'n need to coom heer.  If we was not in a muddle among\nourseln, I should'n ha' been, by my own fellow weavers and workin'\nbrothers, so mistook.  If Mr. Bounderby had ever know'd me right   if he'd\never know'd me at aw   he would'n ha' took'n offence wi' me.  He would'n\nha' suspect'n me.  But look up yonder, Rachael!  Look aboove!\"\n\nFollowing his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.\n\n      [Picture: Stephen Blackpool recovered from the Old Hell Shaft]\n\n\"It ha' shined upon me,\" he said reverently, \"in my pain and trouble down\nbelow.  It ha' shined into my mind.  I ha' look'n at 't and thowt o'\nthee, Rachael, till the muddle in my mind have cleared awa, above a bit,\nI hope.  If soom ha' been wantin' in unnerstan'in me better, I, too, ha'\nbeen wantin' in unnerstan'in them better.  When I got thy letter, I\neasily believen that what the yoong ledy sen and done to me, and what her\nbrother sen and done to me, was one, and that there were a wicked plot\nbetwixt 'em.  When I fell, I were in anger wi' her, an' hurryin on t' be\nas onjust t' her as oothers was t' me.  But in our judgments, like as in\nour doins, we mun bear and forbear.  In my pain an' trouble, lookin up\nyonder,   wi' it shinin on me   I ha' seen more clear, and ha' made it my\ndyin prayer that aw th' world may on'y coom toogether more, an' get a\nbetter unnerstan'in o' one another, than when I were in 't my own weak\nseln.\"\n\nLouisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite side to\nRachael, so that he could see her.\n\n\"You ha' heard?\" he said, after a few moments' silence.  \"I ha' not\nforgot you, ledy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Stephen, I have heard you.  And your prayer is mine.\"\n\n\"You ha' a father.  Will yo tak' a message to him?\"\n\n\"He is here,\" said Louisa, with dread.  \"Shall I bring him to you?\"\n\n\"If yo please.\"\n\nLouisa returned with her father.  Standing hand-in-hand, they both looked\ndown upon the solemn countenance.\n\n\"Sir, yo will clear me an' mak my name good wi' aw men.  This I leave to\nyo.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how?\n\n\"Sir,\" was the reply: \"yor son will tell yo how.  Ask him.  I mak no\ncharges: I leave none ahint me: not a single word.  I ha' seen an' spok'n\nwi' yor son, one night.  I ask no more o' yo than that yo clear me   an' I\ntrust to yo to do 't.\"\n\nThe bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being\nanxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to\ngo in front of the litter.  Before it was raised, and while they were\narranging how to go, he said to Rachael, looking upward at the star:\n\n\"Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin' on me down there in my\ntrouble, I thowt it were the star as guided to Our Saviour's home.  I\nawmust think it be the very star!\"\n\nThey lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to\ntake him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead.\n\n\"Rachael, beloved lass!  Don't let go my hand.  We may walk toogether\nt'night, my dear!\"\n\n\"I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen, all the way.\"\n\n\"Bless thee!  Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!\"\n\nThey carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and\nover the wide landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers.  Very\nfew whispers broke the mournful silence.  It was soon a funeral\nprocession.  The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor;\nand through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his\nRedeemer's rest.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VII\nWHELP-HUNTING\n\n\nBEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure\nhad disappeared from within it.  Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not\nstood near Louisa, who held her father's arm, but in a retired place by\nthemselves.  When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch, Sissy,\nattentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadow   a sight\nin the horror of his face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but\none   and whispered in his ear.  Without turning his head, he conferred\nwith her a few moments, and vanished.  Thus the whelp had gone out of the\ncircle before the people moved.\n\nWhen the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby's,\ndesiring his son to come to him directly.  The reply was, that Mr.\nBounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him\nsince, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge.\n\n\"I believe, father,\" said Louisa, \"he will not come back to town\nto-night.\"  Mr. Gradgrind turned away, and said no more.\n\nIn the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was\nopened, and seeing his son's place empty (he had not the courage to look\nin at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way\nthere.  To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but\nentreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ\nhis son at a distance for a little while.  Also, that he was charged with\nthe duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool's memory, and declaring the\nthief.  Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street\nafter his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense\nsoap-bubble, without its beauty.\n\nMr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that\nday.  When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening\nit, \"Not now, my dears; in the evening.\"  On their return in the evening,\nhe said, \"I am not able yet   to-morrow.\"  He ate nothing all day, and had\nno candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at\nnight.\n\nBut, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took\nhis usual place at the table.  Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed\ndown; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days\nwhen in this life he wanted nothing   but Facts.  Before he left the room,\nhe appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head\ndrooping, went away.\n\n\"Dear father,\" said Louisa, when they kept their appointment, \"you have\nthree young children left.  They will be different, I will be different\nyet, with Heaven's help.\"\n\nShe gave her hand to Sissy, as if she meant with her help too.\n\n\"Your wretched brother,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Do you think he had\nplanned this robbery, when he went with you to the lodging?\"\n\n\"I fear so, father.  I know he had wanted money very much, and had spent\na great deal.\"\n\n\"The poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his evil brain\nto cast suspicion on him?\"\n\n\"I think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there, father.  For I\nasked him to go there with me.  The visit did not originate with him.\"\n\n\"He had some conversation with the poor man.  Did he take him aside?\"\n\n\"He took him out of the room.  I asked him afterwards, why he had done\nso, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and\nwhen I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine\ntoo truly what passed between them.\"\n\n\"Let me know,\" said her father, \"if your thoughts present your guilty\nbrother in the same dark view as mine.\"\n\n\"I fear, father,\" hesitated Louisa, \"that he must have made some\nrepresentation to Stephen Blackpool   perhaps in my name, perhaps in his\nown   which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never\ndone before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before\nhe left the town.\"\n\n\"Too plain!\" returned the father.  \"Too plain!\"\n\nHe shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.  Recovering\nhimself, he said:\n\n\"And now, how is he to be found?  How is he to be saved from justice?  In\nthe few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the\ntruth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us?  Ten thousand pounds\ncould not effect it.\"\n\n\"Sissy has effected it, father.\"\n\nHe raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house,\nand said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, \"It is\nalways you, my child!\"\n\n\"We had our fears,\" Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, \"before\nyesterday; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last\nnight, and heard what passed (being close to Rachael all the time), I\nwent to him when no one saw, and said to him, \"Don't look at me.  See\nwhere your father is.  Escape at once, for his sake and your own!\"  He\nwas in a tremble before I whispered to him, and he started and trembled\nmore then, and said, \"Where can I go?  I have very little money, and I\ndon't know who will hide me!\"  I thought of father's old circus.  I have\nnot forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of\nhim in a paper only the other day.  I told him to hurry there, and tell\nhis name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came.  \"I'll get to him\nbefore the morning,\" he said.  And I saw him shrink away among the\npeople.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" exclaimed his father.  \"He may be got abroad yet.\"\n\nIt was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was\nwithin three hours' journey of Liverpool, whence he could be swiftly\ndispatched to any part of the world.  But, caution being necessary in\ncommunicating with him   for there was a greater danger every moment of his\nbeing suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr.\nBounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman\npart   it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in\nquestion, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father,\nsetting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same\nbourne by another and wider route.  It was further agreed that he should\nnot present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be\nmistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to\ntake flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy and\nLouisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery\nand disgrace, of his father's being at hand and of the purpose for which\nthey had come.  When these arrangements had been well considered and were\nfully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into\nexecution.  Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his\nown house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to\ntravel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different\ncourse, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.\n\nThe two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers\nof minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down\nwells   which was the only variety of those branches   and, early in the\nmorning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the town they\nsought.  From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old\npostilion, who happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so\nwere smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived:\nwhich, although not a magnificent or even savoury approach, was, as is\nusual in such cases, the legitimate highway.\n\nThe first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of\nSleary's Circus.  The company had departed for another town more than\ntwenty miles off, and had opened there last night.  The connection\nbetween the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling\non that road was very slow.  Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and\nno rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious\ncircumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of\nSleary's Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o'clock when they\nstopped in the market-place.\n\nA Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour,\nwas in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon\nthe stones of the street.  Sissy recommended that, to avoid making\ninquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present\nthemselves to pay at the door.  If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he\nwould be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion.  If he were\nnot, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done\nwith the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still.\n\nTherefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered\nbooth.  The flag with the inscription SLEARY'S HORSE-RIDING was there;\nand the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there.  Master\nKidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest\ncredulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of\ncircumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made\nhimself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the\nexchequer   having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his leisure\nmoments and superfluous forces.  In the extreme sharpness of his look out\nfor base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw\nanything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in.\n\nThe Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black\nspots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite\nrecreation of that monarch to do.  Sissy, though well acquainted with his\nRoyal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his\nreign was peaceful.  Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful\nEquestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who\nhumorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her\nin.\n\nMr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash,\nand the Clown had only said, \"If you do it again, I'll throw the horse at\nyou!\" when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.  But they\ngot through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving\nfor the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive\neye than into his fixed one.  The performance seemed a little long to\nSissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an\nopportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said \"Indeed, sir!\" to all his\nobservations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two\nlegs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,\nand laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs,\nand threw 'em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.  For, although an\ningenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog,\nand a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great\nsuspense.  At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her\ncurtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had\njust warmed himself, and said, \"Now _I_'ll have a turn!\" when Sissy was\ntouched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.\n\nShe took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very\nlittle private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden\nceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation,\nas if they were coming through.  \"Thethilia,\" said Mr. Sleary, who had\nbrandy and water at hand, \"it doth me good to thee you.  You wath alwayth\na favourite with uth, and you've done uth credith thinth the old timeth\nI'm thure.  You mutht thee our people, my dear, afore we thpeak of\nbithnith, or they'll break their hearth   ethpethially the women.  Here'th\nJothphine hath been and got married to E. W. B. Childerth, and thee hath\ngot a boy, and though he'th only three yearth old, he thtickth on to any\npony you can bring againtht him.  He'th named The Little Wonder of\nThcolathtic Equitation; and if you don't hear of that boy at Athley'th,\nyou'll hear of him at Parith.  And you recollect Kidderminthter, that\nwath thought to be rather thweet upon yourthelf?  Well.  He'th married\ntoo.  Married a widder.  Old enough to be hith mother.  Thee wath\nTightrope, thee wath, and now thee'th nothing   on accounth of fat.\nThey've got two children, tho we're thtrong in the Fairy bithnith and the\nNurthery dodge.  If you wath to thee our Children in the Wood, with their\nfather and mother both a dyin' on a horthe   their uncle a retheiving of\n'em ath hith wardth, upon a horthe   themthelvth both a goin' a\nblack-berryin' on a horthe   and the Robinth a coming in to cover 'em with\nleavth, upon a horthe   you'd thay it wath the completetht thing ath ever\nyou thet your eyeth on!  And you remember Emma Gordon, my dear, ath wath\na'motht a mother to you?  Of courthe you do; I needn't athk.  Well!\nEmma, thee lotht her huthband.  He wath throw'd a heavy back-fall off a\nElephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath the Thultan of the Indieth, and\nhe never got the better of it; and thee married a thecond time   married a\nCheethemonger ath fell in love with her from the front   and he'th a\nOvertheer and makin' a fortun.\"\n\nThese various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now, related with\ngreat heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering\nwhat a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was.  Afterwards he\nbrought in Josephine, and E. W. B. Childers (rather deeply lined in the\njaws by daylight), and the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and in\na word, all the company.  Amazing creatures they were in Louisa's eyes,\nso white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative\nof leg; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about Sissy, and\nvery natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears.\n\n\"There!  Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children, and hugged all the\nwomen, and thaken handth all round with all the men, clear, every one of\nyou, and ring in the band for the thecond part!\"\n\nAs soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.  \"Now, Thethilia,\nI don't athk to know any thecreth, but I thuppothe I may conthider thith\nto be Mith Thquire.\"\n\n\"This is his sister.  Yes.\"\n\n\"And t'other on'th daughter.  That'h what I mean.  Hope I thee you well,\nmith.  And I hope the Thquire'th well?\"\n\n\"My father will be here soon,\" said Louisa, anxious to bring him to the\npoint.  \"Is my brother safe?\"\n\n\"Thafe and thound!\" he replied.  \"I want you jutht to take a peep at the\nRing, mith, through here.  Thethilia, you know the dodgeth; find a\nthpy-hole for yourthelf.\"\n\nThey each looked through a chink in the boards.\n\n\"That'h Jack the Giant Killer   piethe of comic infant bithnith,\" said\nSleary.  \"There'th a property-houthe, you thee, for Jack to hide in;\nthere'th my Clown with a thauthepan-lid and a thpit, for Jack'th\nthervant; there'th little Jack himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour;\nthere'th two comic black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe, to\nthtand by it and to bring it in and clear it; and the Giant (a very\necthpenthive bathket one), he an't on yet.  Now, do you thee 'em all?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they both said.\n\n\"Look at 'em again,\" said Sleary, \"look at 'em well.  You thee em all?\nVery good.  Now, mith;\" he put a form for them to sit on; \"I have my\nopinionth, and the Thquire your father hath hith.  I don't want to know\nwhat your brother'th been up to; ith better for me not to know.  All I\nthay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia, and I'll thtand by the\nThquire.  Your brother ith one them black thervanth.\"\n\nLouisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Ith a fact,\" said Sleary, \"and even knowin' it, you couldn't put your\nfinger on him.  Let the Thquire come.  I thall keep your brother here\nafter the performanth.  I thant undreth him, nor yet wath hith paint off.\nLet the Thquire come here after the performanth, or come here yourthelf\nafter the performanth, and you thall find your brother, and have the\nwhole plathe to talk to him in.  Never mind the lookth of him, ath long\nath he'th well hid.\"\n\nLouisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained Mr. Sleary\nno longer then.  She left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of\ntears; and she and Sissy went away until later in the afternoon.\n\nMr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  He too had encountered\nno one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary's assistance, of\ngetting his disgraced son to Liverpool in the night.  As neither of the\nthree could be his companion without almost identifying him under any\ndisguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust,\nbeseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South\nAmerica, or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most\nspeedily and privately dispatched.\n\nThis done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated;\nnot only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses.  After\nwatching it a long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit\ndown by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they\nmight approach.\n\n\"Your thervant, Thquire,\" was his cautious salutation as they passed in.\n\"If you want me you'll find me here.  You muthn't mind your thon having a\ncomic livery on.\"\n\nThey all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the\nClown's performing chair in the middle of the ring.  On one of the back\nbenches, remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place,\nsat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the misery to\ncall his son.\n\nIn a preposterous coat, like a beadle's, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated\nto an unspeakable extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled\nshoes, and a mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him, and everything of\ncoarse material, moth-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his black\nface, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition\ndaubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful\nas the whelp in his comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other\nmeans have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.  And\none of his model children had come to this!\n\nAt first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining\nup there by himself.  Yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly\nmade can be called yielding, to the entreaties of Sissy   for Louisa he\ndisowned altogether   he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in the\nsawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its\nlimits from where his father sat.\n\n\"How was this done?\" asked the father.\n\n\"How was what done?\" moodily answered the son.\n\n\"This robbery,\" said the father, raising his voice upon the word.\n\n\"I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went\naway.  I had had the key that was found, made long before.  I dropped it\nthat morning, that it might be supposed to have been used.  I didn't take\nthe money all at once.  I pretended to put my balance away every night,\nbut I didn't.  Now you know all about it.\"\n\n\"If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,\" said the father, \"it would have\nshocked me less than this!\"\n\n\"I don't see why,\" grumbled the son.  \"So many people are employed in\nsituations of trust; so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest.\nI have heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law.  How can _I_\nhelp laws?  You have comforted others with such things, father.  Comfort\nyourself!\"\n\nThe father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in his\ndisgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his hands, with the black partly\nworn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey.  The evening was\nfast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes\nrestlessly and impatiently towards his father.  They were the only parts\nof his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was\nso thick.\n\n\"You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must.  I can't be more miserable anywhere,\" whimpered the\nwhelp, \"than I have been here, ever since I can remember.  That's one\nthing.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with Sleary, to whom he\nsubmitted the question, How to get this deplorable object away?\n\n\"Why, I've been thinking of it, Thquire.  There'th not muth time to\nlothe, tho you muth thay yeth or no.  Ith over twenty mileth to the rail.\nThere'th a coath in half an hour, that goeth _to_ the rail, 'purpothe to\ncath the mail train.  That train will take him right to Liverpool.\"\n\n\"But look at him,\" groaned Mr. Gradgrind.  \"Will any coach   \"\n\n\"I don't mean that he thould go in the comic livery,\" said Sleary.  \"Thay\nthe word, and I'll make a Jothkin of him, out of the wardrobe, in five\nminutes.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.\n\n\"A Jothkin   a Carter.  Make up your mind quick, Thquire.  There'll be beer\nto feth.  I've never met with nothing but beer ath'll ever clean a comic\nblackamoor.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out from a box,\na smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly\nchanged clothes behind a screen of baize; Mr. Sleary rapidly brought\nbeer, and washed him white again.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sleary, \"come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I'll go\nwith you there, and they'll thuppothe you one of my people.  Thay\nfarewell to your family, and tharp'th the word.\"  With which he\ndelicately retired.\n\n\"Here is your letter,\" said Mr. Gradgrind.  \"All necessary means will be\nprovided for you.  Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the\nshocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to\nwhich it has led.  Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive\nyou as I do!\"\n\nThe culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their\npathetic tone.  But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh.\n\n\"Not you.  I don't want to have anything to say to you!\"\n\n\"O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\"\n\n\"After all your love!\" he returned, obdurately.  \"Pretty love!  Leaving\nold Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off,\nand going home just when I was in the greatest danger.  Pretty love that!\nComing out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you\nsaw the net was gathering round me.  Pretty love that!  You have\nregularly given me up.  You never cared for me.\"\n\n\"Tharp'th the word!\" said Sleary, at the door.\n\nThey all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him,\nand loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her\nso, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one\nran against them.  Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him\nwhile his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.\n\nFor, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin\nnostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face\nmore colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when\nother people ran themselves into a glow.  There he stood, panting and\nheaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when\nhe had run them down before.\n\n\"I'm sorry to interfere with your plans,\" said Bitzer, shaking his head,\n\"but I can't allow myself to be done by horse-riders.  I must have young\nMr. Tom; he mustn't be got away by horse-riders; here he is in a smock\nfrock, and I must have him!\"\n\nBy the collar, too, it seemed.  For, so he took possession of him.\n\n\n\n",

        "raw text": " VIII\nPHILOSOPHICAL\n\n\nTHEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders\nout.  Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in\nthe Ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the\ntwilight.\n\n\"Bitzer,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to\nhim, \"have you a heart?\"\n\n\"The circulation, sir,\" returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the\nquestion, \"couldn't be carried on without one.  No man, sir, acquainted\nwith the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the\nblood, can doubt that I have a heart.\"\n\n\"Is it accessible,\" cried Mr. Gradgrind, \"to any compassionate\ninfluence?\"\n\n\"It is accessible to Reason, sir,\" returned the excellent young man.\n\"And to nothing else.\"\n\nThey stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind's face as white as the\npursuer's.\n\n\"What motive   even what motive in reason   can you have for preventing the\nescape of this wretched youth,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"and crushing his\nmiserable father?  See his sister here.  Pity us!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner,\n\"since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom\nback to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.  I have\nsuspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first.  I had had\nmy eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways.  I have kept my\nobservations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs\nagainst him now, besides his running away, and besides his own\nconfession, which I was just in time to overhear.  I had the pleasure of\nwatching your house yesterday morning, and following you here.  I am\ngoing to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him\nover to Mr. Bounderby.  Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby\nwill then promote me to young Mr. Tom's situation.  And I wish to have\nhis situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\"\n\n\"If this is solely a question of self-interest with you   \" Mr. Gradgrind\nbegan.\n\n\"I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\" returned Bitzer; \"but I am\nsure you know that the whole social system is a question of\nself-interest.  What you must always appeal to, is a person's\nself-interest.  It's your only hold.  We are so constituted.  I was\nbrought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are\naware.\"\n\n\"What sum of money,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"will you set against your\nexpected promotion?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" returned Bitzer, \"for hinting at the proposal; but I\nwill not set any sum against it.  Knowing that your clear head would\npropose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind;\nand I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,\nwould not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the\nBank.\"\n\n\"Bitzer,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would\nhave said, See how miserable I am!  \"Bitzer, I have but one chance left\nto soften you.  You were many years at my school.  If, in remembrance of\nthe pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any\ndegree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat\nand pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.\"\n\n\"I really wonder, sir,\" rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative\nmanner, \"to find you taking a position so untenable.  My schooling was\npaid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.\"\n\nIt was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that\neverything was to be paid for.  Nobody was ever on any account to give\nanybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase.  Gratitude was\nto be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.  Every\ninch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a\nbargain across a counter.  And if we didn't get to Heaven that way, it\nwas not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.\n\n\"I don't deny,\" added Bitzer, \"that my schooling was cheap.  But that\ncomes right, sir.  I was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose\nof myself in the dearest.\"\n\nHe was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy crying.\n\n\"Pray don't do that,\" said he, \"it's of no use doing that: it only\nworries.  You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr.\nTom; whereas I have none at all.  I am only going, on the reasonable\ngrounds I have mentioned, to take him back to Coketown.  If he was to\nresist, I should set up the cry of Stop thief!  But, he won't resist, you\nmay depend upon it.\"\n\nMr. Sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably\njammed in his head as his fixed one, had listened to these doctrines with\nprofound attention, here stepped forward.\n\n\"Thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter knowth perfectly\nwell (better than you, becauthe I thed it to her), that I didn't know\nwhat your thon had done, and that I didn't want to know   I thed it wath\nbetter not, though I only thought, then, it wath thome thkylarking.\nHowever, thith young man having made it known to be a robbery of a bank,\nwhy, that'h a theriouth thing; muth too theriouth a thing for me to\ncompound, ath thith young man hath very properly called it.\nConthequently, Thquire, you muthn't quarrel with me if I take thith young\nman'th thide, and thay he'th right and there'th no help for it.  But I\ntell you what I'll do, Thquire; I'll drive your thon and thith young man\nover to the rail, and prevent expothure here.  I can't conthent to do\nmore, but I'll do that.\"\n\nFresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction on Mr. Gradgrind's\npart, followed this desertion of them by their last friend.  But, Sissy\nglanced at him with great attention; nor did she in her own breast\nmisunderstand him.  As they were all going out again, he favoured her\nwith one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.\nAs he locked the door, he said excitedly:\n\n\"The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I'll thtand by the Thquire.\nMore than that: thith ith a prethiouth rathcal, and belongth to that\nbluthtering Cove that my people nearly pitht out o' winder.  It'll be a\ndark night; I've got a horthe that'll do anything but thpeak; I've got a\npony that'll go fifteen mile an hour with Childerth driving of him; I've\ngot a dog that'll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth.  Get a\nword with the young Thquire.  Tell him, when he theeth our horthe begin\nto danthe, not to be afraid of being thpilt, but to look out for a\npony-gig coming up.  Tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump\ndown, and it'll take him off at a rattling pathe.  If my dog leth thith\nyoung man thtir a peg on foot, I give him leave to go.  And if my horthe\never thtirth from that thpot where he beginth a danthing, till the\nmorning   I don't know him?   Tharp'th the word!\"\n\nThe word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr. Childers, sauntering about\nthe market-place in a pair of slippers, had his cue, and Mr. Sleary's\nequipage was ready.  It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog\nbarking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one\npracticable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.\nSoon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a\nformidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking\nclose to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the\nevent of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.\n\nThe other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense.  At eight\no'clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high\nspirits.\n\n\"All right, Thquire!\" said Mr. Sleary, \"your thon may be aboard-a-thip by\nthith time.  Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left\nthere latht night.  The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat\n(he would have walthed if he hadn't been in harneth), and then I gave him\nthe word and he went to thleep comfortable.  When that prethiouth young\nRathcal thed he'd go for'ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith\nneck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and\nrolled him over.  Tho he come back into the drag, and there he that,\n'till I turned the horthe'th head, at half-patht thixth thith morning.\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as\ndelicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in money.\n\n\"I don't want money mythelf, Thquire; but Childerth ith a family man, and\nif you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightn't be\nunactheptable.  Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or\na thet of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take 'em.\nBrandy and water I alwayth take.\"  He had already called for a glass, and\nnow called for another.  \"If you wouldn't think it going too far,\nThquire, to make a little thpread for the company at about three and\nthixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make 'em happy.\"\n\nAll these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly\nundertook to render.  Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for\nsuch a service.\n\n\"Very well, Thquire; then, if you'll only give a Horthe-riding, a\nbethpeak, whenever you can, you'll more than balanthe the account.  Now,\nThquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting\nword with you.\"\n\nLouisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring\nand drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on:\n\n\"Thquire,   you don't need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.\"\n\n\"Their instinct,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"is surprising.\"\n\n\"Whatever you call it   and I'm bletht if _I_ know what to call it\"   said\nSleary, \"it ith athtonithing.  The way in whith a dog'll find you   the\ndithtanthe he'll come!\"\n\n\"His scent,\" said Mr. Gradgrind, \"being so fine.\"\n\n\"I'm bletht if I know what to call it,\" repeated Sleary, shaking his\nhead, \"but I have had dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think\nwhether that dog hadn't gone to another dog, and thed, \"You don't happen\nto know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?  Perthon of the name of\nThleary, in the Horthe-Riding way   thtout man   game eye?\"  And whether that\ndog mightn't have thed, \"Well, I can't thay I know him mythelf, but I\nknow a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him.\"  And\nwhether that dog mightn't have thought it over, and thed, \"Thleary,\nThleary!  O yeth, to be thure!  A friend of mine menthioned him to me at\none time.  I can get you hith addreth directly.\"  In conthequenth of my\nbeing afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht\nbe a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that _I_ don't know!\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation.\n\n\"Any way,\" said Sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water,\n\"ith fourteen month ago, Thquire, thinthe we wath at Chethter.  We wath\ngetting up our Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into\nour Ring, by the thtage door, a dog.  He had travelled a long way, he\nwath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind.  He\nwent round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking\nfor a child he know'd; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up\nbehind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he\nwagged hith tail and died.  Thquire, that dog wath Merrylegth.\"\n\n\"Sissy's father's dog!\"\n\n\"Thethilia'th father'th old dog.  Now, Thquire, I can take my oath, from\nmy knowledge of that dog, that that man wath dead   and buried   afore that\ndog come back to me.  Joth'phine and Childerth and me talked it over a\nlong time, whether I thould write or not.  But we agreed, \"No.  There'th\nnothing comfortable to tell; why unthettle her mind, and make her\nunhappy?\"  Tho, whether her father bathely detherted her; or whether he\nbroke hith own heart alone, rather than pull her down along with him;\nnever will be known, now, Thquire, till   no, not till we know how the\ndogth findth uth out!\"\n\n\"She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour; and she will\nbelieve in his affection to the last moment of her life,\" said Mr.\nGradgrind.\n\n\"It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon, don't it, Thquire?\"\nsaid Mr. Sleary, musing as he looked down into the depths of his brandy\nand water: \"one, that there ith a love in the world, not all\nThelf-interetht after all, but thomething very different; t'other, that\nit hath a way of ith own of calculating or not calculating, whith\nthomehow or another ith at leatht ath hard to give a name to, ath the\nwayth of the dogth ith!\"\n\nMr. Gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.  Mr. Sleary\nemptied his glass and recalled the ladies.\n\n\"Thethilia my dear, kith me and good-bye!  Mith Thquire, to thee you\ntreating of her like a thithter, and a thithter that you trutht and\nhonour with all your heart and more, ith a very pretty thight to me.  I\nhope your brother may live to be better detherving of you, and a greater\ncomfort to you.  Thquire, thake handth, firtht and latht!  Don't be croth\nwith uth poor vagabondth.  People mutht be amuthed.  They can't be\nalwayth a learning, nor yet they can't be alwayth a working, they an't\nmade for it.  You _mutht_ have uth, Thquire.  Do the withe thing and the\nkind thing too, and make the betht of uth; not the wurtht!\"\n\n\"And I never thought before,\" said Mr. Sleary, putting his head in at the\ndoor again to say it, \"that I wath tho muth of a Cackler!\"\n\n\n\n",

Mr. Bounderby felt\nthat Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be\nwiser than he.  Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant\ndiscovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a\nwoman in her dependent position, over and over in his mind, until it\naccumulated with turning like a great snowball.  At last he made the\ndiscovery that to discharge this highly connected female   to have it in\nhis power to say, \"She was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me,\nbut I wouldn't have it, and got rid of her'   would be to get the utmost\npossible amount of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the same\ntime to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her deserts.\n\nFilled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby came in to\nlunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his\nportrait was.  Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with her foot in her cotton\nstirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.\n\nSince the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity for Mr.\nBounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition.  In virtue\nthereof, it had become her habit to assume a woful look, which woful look\nshe now bestowed upon her patron.\n\n\"What's the matter now, ma'am?\" said Mr. Bounderby, in a very short,\nrough way.\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit, \"do not bite my nose off.\"\n\n\"Bite your nose off, ma'am?\" repeated Mr. Bounderby.  \"_Your_ nose!\"\nmeaning, as Mrs. Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for\nthe purpose.  After which offensive implication, he cut himself a crust\nof bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.\n\nMrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said, \"Mr. Bounderby,\nsir!\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am?\" retorted Mr. Bounderby.  \"What are you staring at?\"\n\n\"May I ask, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, \"have you been ruffled this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"May I inquire, sir,\" pursued the injured woman, \"whether _I_ am the\nunfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?\"\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, \"I am not come here to\nbe bullied.  A female may be highly connected, but she can't be permitted\nto bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put up\nwith it.\"  (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on: foreseeing that if\nhe allowed of details, he would be beaten.)\n\nMrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Coriolanian eyebrows;\ngathered up her work into its proper basket; and rose.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, majestically.  \"It is apparent to me that I am in your\nway at present.  I will retire to my own apartment.\"\n\n\"Allow me to open the door, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself.\"\n\n\"You had better allow me, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, passing her, and\ngetting his hand upon the lock; \"because I can take the opportunity of\nsaying a word to you, before you go.  Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I rather think\nyou are cramped here, do you know?  It appears to me, that, under my\nhumble roof, there's hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in\nother people's affairs.\"\n\nMrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great\npoliteness, \"Really, sir?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have\nhappened, ma'am,\" said Bounderby; \"and it appears to my poor judgment   \"\n\n\"Oh!  Pray, sir,\" Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness,\n\"don't disparage your judgment.  Everybody knows how unerring Mr.\nBounderby's judgment is.  Everybody has had proofs of it.  It must be the\ntheme of general conversation.  Disparage anything in yourself but your\njudgment, sir,\" said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.\n\nMr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:\n\n\"It appears to me, ma'am, I say, that a different sort of establishment\naltogether would bring out a lady of _your_ powers.  Such an\nestablishment as your relation, Lady Scadgers's, now.  Don't you think\nyou might find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?\"\n\n\"It never occurred to me before, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit; \"but now\nyou mention it, should think it highly probable.\"\n\n\"Then suppose you try, ma'am,\" said Bounderby, laying an envelope with a\ncheque in it in her little basket.  \"You can take your own time for\ngoing, ma'am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to\na lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by herself, and not to be\nintruded upon.  I really ought to apologise to you   being only Josiah\nBounderby of Coketown   for having stood in your light so long.\"\n\n\"Pray don't name it, sir,\" returned Mrs. Sparsit.  \"If that portrait\ncould speak, sir   but it has the advantage over the original of not\npossessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others,   it would\ntestify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually\naddressed it as the picture of a Noodle.  Nothing that a Noodle does, can\nawaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only\ninspire contempt.\"\n\nThus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a medal struck to\ncommemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him fixedly from head to\nfoot, swept disdainfully past him, and ascended the staircase.  Mr.\nBounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire; projecting himself\nafter his old explosive manner into his portrait   and into futurity.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nInto how much of futurity?  He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily\nfight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the\ngrudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in\nbed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by\nabout the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a\nmere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?  Did he\ncatch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the\nrising young man, so devoted to his master's great merits, who had won\nyoung Tom's place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the\ntimes when by various rascals he was spirited away?  Did he see any faint\nreflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby\nfive-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking\nupon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine\nin Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend\na Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for\never be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all\nhealthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster?\nHad he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah\nBounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and\nthis same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder,\nfalse pretences, vile example, little service and much law?  Probably\nnot.  Yet the portrait was to see it all out.\n\nHere was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting\nthoughtful in his own room.  How much of futurity did _he_ see?  Did he\nsee himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible\ntheories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures\nsubservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind\nthat Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?  Did he catch sight of\nhimself, therefore much despised by his late political associates?  Did\nhe see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national\ndustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an\nabstraction called a People, \"taunting the honourable gentleman' with\nthis and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small\nhours of the morning?  Probably he had that much foreknowledge, knowing\nhis men.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nHere was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in\ndays of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face.  How much of the\nfuture might arise before _her_ vision?  Broadsides in the streets,\nsigned with her father's name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool,\nweaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own\nson, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not\nbring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present.\nSo, Stephen Blackpool's tombstone, with her father's record of his death,\nwas almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be.  These things she\ncould plainly see.  But, how much of the Future?\n\nA working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again\nappearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at\nthe set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty,\nalways dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even\ncheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have\ncompassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was\nsometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a\nwoman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do\nit as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more?\nDid Louisa see this?  Such a thing was to be.\n\nA lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted\nwith tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the\ntreasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear\nface?  At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope of seeing\nher, and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand,\nsaying \"he died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence\nand love of you: his last word being your name'?  Did Louisa see these\nthings?  Such things were to be.\n\nHerself again a wife   a mother   lovingly watchful of her children, ever\ncareful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a\nchildhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing,\nand a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness\nto the wisest?  Did Louisa see this?  Such a thing was never to be.\n\nBut, happy Sissy's happy children loving her; all children loving her;\nshe, grown learned in childish lore; thinking no innocent and pretty\nfancy ever to be despised; trying hard to know her humbler\nfellow-creatures, and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality\nwith those imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart of\ninfancy will wither up, the sturdiest physical manhood will be morally\nstark death, and the plainest national prosperity figures can show, will\nbe the Writing on the Wall,   she holding this course as part of no\nfantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge, or\ncovenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but simply as a duty to be\ndone,   did Louisa see these things of herself?  These things were to be.\n\nDear reader!  It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of\naction, similar things shall be or not.  Let them be!  We shall sit with\nlighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and\ncold.",
